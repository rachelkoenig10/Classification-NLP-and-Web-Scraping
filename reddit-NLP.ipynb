       "'My [23F] boyfriend [21M] of two years wants me to move to a different state with him so he can go to collegeFirst post, sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. It will be long, my apologies.\\n\\nTo preface this, I have lived on my own and been financially independent for about 4 years and I moved to a new state a few months ago to be closer to my job and am renting a house with one other person for a great price. My job offers excellent benefits, bonuses, and vacation time. It\\'s a stressful job and the pay isn\\'t amazing but for a first \"grown-up job\" out of college, I\\'m not doing bad at all. Unfortunately, my moving has put a strain on my relationship as now I am about an hour from where my bf lives with his parents and he only sees me once every week or two. Before that, he would come to see me at my apartment every day and stay over most nights. It became an issue to my roommates because he did not help financially at all but that is a different story (still important to mention).\\n\\nWhen we met I was in college and my bf was considering going to a college 5-7 hours away and we never really talked about it because we had just started dating and I didn\\'t feel as though I had any input. Our relationship was only a couple months old at that point. I understood we wouldn\\'t be a thing if he went away and would have been fine if he decided to move away as I was not invested yet. He made the decision to work instead of going to college which was fine, and I never once asked him to stay for me.\\n\\nMoving forward two years, my boyfriend has decided it is time to go to this school and asked me to move with him. Until this point, he has been working in retail and has had little drive to look for a job that he enjoys or pays him more. He has been intermittently unemployed or working part-time and rarely has any money saved. I\\'ve been putting pressure on him to go to school or find a job willing to pay him more or give him more hours because he is not able to support himself even though he still lives with his parents. \\n\\nThe problem lies in that he would likely be moving at the end of August to a dorm. In this situation, I would have to quit my job and find a new one, find housing and probably a new roommate, and make new friends. Personally, I feel it is unfair of him to ask me to move with him if we are not even moving in together. I would lose everything and he wouldn\\'t have to give up anything. I would have to uproot my life for him to be in college for 2-4 years just to move again when he graduates. And financially he would not be responsible or helpful if I could not find a job or affordable housing. If I failed to secure a job and housing I would be unable to turn to him for help. He would be all set with his dorm and a goal to work towards. And it would probably be very convenient for him to stay at my place off campus if he wanted. \\n\\nHe thinks it should be easy for me as I have moved many times(except every time I have had a job and/or housing already lined up), I have not made any strong new connections since moving to my new state (but all my old friends are about 1-2 hours away and we take turns seeing each other), and since he would do the same for me. If I had asked him to move for me I would already at least have housing for both of us. It does not seem fair for him to ask me to move with no guarantee of any stability and to abandon what I already have. \\n\\nSo essentially I am asking if I am wrong here if I tell him no? Am I being unreasonable or is he making an unreasonable request of me?\\n\\nLet me know if this is confusing or if I need to provide more information!'"

       "\"My (18F) younger brother (17M) and I constantly fight over noise complaints. I'm really sick of it at this point, and I'm lost as to what to do.Hey, guys. For several years my younger brother and I have butted heads - he's incredibly loud while I prefer some peace and quiet. We used to spend a lot of time doing normal sibling squabbling stuff when we were younger, but everything has gotten well past that point and we genuinely do not like each other anymore. \\n\\nI just recently finished my first semester at a good university only 40 mins away, so I don't need a dorm and I can just live at home. I spend a lot of my time studying, preferably with some quiet, but I don't mind noise such as someone watching TV in the living room, or people over, or whatever. I do feel that my brother is excessively loud and inconsiderate, however. Our rooms are right beside each other, and he has a habit of leaving his room door wide open while he blasts music from a bass-boosted speaker, or take calls at full volume on speaker, watch his shows (also at full volume and on speaker), or play games. It's incredibly disruptive and I've tried asking him to close his door but he becomes really defiant and when he does he'll just increase the volume such that I can STILL clearly hear it through both closed doors. For reference, he's so loud you can hear everything clearly even from the living room, which is on the other side of the house. He will also frequently bring a bunch of friends over who will (not maliciously, mind you) end up blocking my car in or blocking the entrance to the garage such that I can't get my motorcycle out either. I've asked him to tell his friends not to block either my bike or car in whenever they're over, but it still happens. Constantly. I'm getting sick of this, honestly.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI've tried asking my parents, but my mother sympathizes with my brother by saying that he's just trying to enjoy his summer. Great, I want him to enjoy his summer too but he really doesn't need his door open blasting music in my general direction to do that. I've tried to explaining that his closing his door doesn't really affect him - he can still listen to his music, now with the added bonus of my not having to listen to it too. My mother and I have been butting heads about this too, unfortunately, but I don't think she understands how irritating it is because her room is on the other side of the house and she isn't constantly subjected to the noise you get when you're directly next to him. I'm frustrated, and I'm tired. I'd like to move out ASAP, but that will have to wait till after university. Any advice, guys? I don't want to start playing dirty by turning off the wifi but I'm really running out of options here. I've tried to be nice.\""
