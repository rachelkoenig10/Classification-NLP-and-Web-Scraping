0,b2nc2f,eganist,[meta] Think of the comments as an inverted Uber rating. (click to find out what this means),"Since two or three times a week we end up removing a few threads on why everyone keeps suggesting breakups, rather than micromanage the community, we figured this post would be prudent:

You know how every Uber rating is right on the verge of 5 stars unless something's particularly off? Everyone's all ""A+++ WOULD RIDE AGAIN."" Same for eBay, Amazon, etc.

Well, think of /r/relationship_advice comments as much the same, only inverted. Two things to always keep in mind:

1. The vast majority of people posting here are posting because they've got a challenge they probably haven't been able to resolve on their own. 

2. In many cases, these challenges are insurmountable (or just exceedingly difficult to deal with). 

**The majority of commenters aren't *necessarily* cynical/assholes, but combine both a one-sided account of what happened—your account—with each commenter's own potential history, grievances, etc., and the resulting brew is pretty dark,** meaning that every post will get drenched in comments like ""dump"" and ""lawyer up."" 

The _key_ is that the number of serious comments telling you to _consider an alternative to breaking up_ is a good way to tell whether or not there's merit to continuing what you've got going. Examples:

* Let's say you're asking whether a particular behavior is a red flag, and that behavior is so bad, the flag's not so much dyed red as it is _literally bleeding._ Nearly every single comment will probably tell you to run. Cool; **Zero Stars.** Shoot I might even lock the thread and tell you it's above our paygrade.

* Together but your s/o cheated on you once? Most comments will probably tell you to run because ""once a cheater, always a cheater."" Some comments might suggest you should stay and work it out, but the details of how the cheating happened might vary the number of these comments. Great; **One or Two Stars.**

* Married but your s/o got drunk and made out with someone else, felt awful about it, immediately left the event where they met that other person and told you what happened and apologized with no prior history of cheating? Many people might _still_ tell you to leave (same reason), but odds are good that equally as many people might tell you to consider staying. Awesome; **Two, maybe even three stars.**

* Good relationship with your S/O but they forget to treat you in the love language you normally need to thrive? Maybe they forget to bring you token flowers/trinkets or other signs of appreciation but otherwise everything's pretty good? Many comments will probably be advice on how to communicate; there'll probably still be a good number of downers but overall this would probably be in the **three to four stars territory.**^^_(This&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;uncommon.)_

* Everything's rosey and you're looking for a way to celebrate your s/o's special promotion, anniversary, birthday, or something else? Probably **four to five stars.**^^_(This&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;uncommon.)_

This applies to platonic, professional, and other relationships that aren't exactly romantic either, but for the sake of not needing a TLDR for the TLDR, I'm avoiding listing every single condition. You get the idea.

Basically, the people telling you to leave probably outnumber the people with less jaded opinions by an order of magnitude, so the best way to consider the advice is to see whether other advice shines through the background blackness of ""break up with them."" If everyone's telling you to break up, that's probably what you should do, but if 1/4 of the comments are telling you another way, you should definitely consider giving that 25% a chance.

You get the drift? 

---

##TL;DR: 

The vast majority of comments will tell you to break up. It's a side effect of the fact that many people who subscribe either have a very dim view of relationships or just do it for the drama. The more people tell you to consider something _other_ than breaking up, the more value there is in trying that other approach, whatever it is.

Yeah, this is the kind of analysis that happens when a sub's been around for almost a decade. It's also long overdue considering we're at over 1.3m subs and y'all are always so grim. shrug. ~~***Comments open for 72 hours or less,***~~ edit: which is to say that we'll take feedback on this and whether there _should_ be any changes to encourage people to be more positive with the advice they give... but honestly, we'd rather not unless someone comes up with an exceedingly compelling reason. If you disagree with a downer, just downvote it.

1,ca66sv,throwawaynocollege01,"Mom had an affair 18 years ago, I [18M] am the product of it. My dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad.","Pretty much the title. I have no idea how to process all this, and I am completely unprepared for what lies ahead :(

Both my older brother and sister went to the same college. My brother graduated two years ago, my sister is set to graduate in two years. Both had their college paid by our dad. Dad paid all their college expenses, including rent, food, their cars, pocket money, you name it.

My brother has a job now, his own place, lives together with his fiancee, and has his life together.

My sister already has a good paying job, and my dad still pays for almost everything for her.

I got accepted to the same college, which was always the plan, and was looking forward to talk with my parents about the next steps, and ask them to help me the same they did for my siblings. I always assumed they had money put aside for my college the way they had for my siblings.

Instead I was met with a story about my mom's cheating, how I am the result of her cheating, and how my dad is not willing to support me any more moving forward.

Dad told me that mom had 18 years to let me know and prepare me for the future, but obviously she never did. He said it was never is place to say anything since I am not his son, and didn't want to interfere with mom's parenting.

Apparently my grandparents know I am not dad's biological son, but they haven't bothered to tell me anything either.

My siblings had no idea, and they are as surprised as I am because there was never a hint of anything being off. I might be naive, but I always thought I had a great relationship with my dad. We go to see sports together, we go fishing together, he tutored me when I had difficulties with math (dad is an engineer), he taught me to drive. I never got a hint he stores resentment towards me. I mean, he gave me my name, and has explained what my name means, and he was very proud of it. It's a story he tells from time to time. He likes to talk about stuff like that about me.

My mom has never said a word about anything, and apparently she was supposed to have ""the talk"" with me, but she never did.

I feel abandoned and unprepared for what lies ahead. I am not even sure I will be able to go to college any more, I always assumed my parents will pay for it. I never had a job, and I am not sure what job I can even get to support me through college, I have no idea how to apply for loans.

All my mom has done is cry and apologize. But nothing of substance, she has no idea how to help me.

I don't even know if I am welcomed home any more, it's all up in the air, I feel shame leaving my room, and if I will be asked to move out I don't know where to go. I don't have any savings, maybe $400 put together.

I am angry at my mom, I am confused about where I stand with my dad. There's a man out there who is my father that never wanted to have anything to do with me. I feel rejected and I have no idea what to do to fix this situation.

Anyone have any idea what to do here?

Do I apologize to my dad? What do I say to him?

Idk, I've been stuck in my room these past few days, reading and browsing reddit. I have no idea what to do.

2,c9ztfk,thegoodtwin28,UPDATE: I'm thinking of distancing myself from my twin sister and telling her close friend about a five year long affair between her husband and my twin sister. Should I do it?,"Thank you for all the helpful comments.

A little while after my husband came back home with our kids I asked him about the pic my sister sent him. He told me that every now and then she sends him pics and asks questions/his opinions etc. I asked him about what has she sent before, and he told me that sometimes in the past she sent him pics of her in different dresses and  hairstyles and asked for his opinions. I asked him if there is anything else she sends him or messages him about and he told me no. I asked why he didn't tell me about the pics she sent him, he told me that since the pics were innocent he didn't think it was necessary to tell me. I told him that he definitely should have told me and he apologised. After that I told him about what my sis confessed to last night and he was in disbelief. I told him that I'm going to cut ties with her and I want him to do the same as well as blocking her phone number. He agreed.

After that I wanted to contact Jane. Since I'm not close with her I didn't have her number and I forgot to get it from my sister's phone last night  so I got it from a mutual friend instead. Then, I called Jane and told her who I was and asked if I could meet her because it's urgent. I gave her my address and told her to come alone. When she arrived we hugged and I took her to my living room and sat her down. Then I explained to her what my sis told me regarding her and Jane's husband's affair and I showed her videos I recorded of their texts and pics/vids she sent him. She burst into tears and wrapped her arms around me. I tried to console her and I offered her my full support.

A few minutes later she thanked me for telling her and told me she's going back home to confront her husband. A few hours after that she called back and told me what went down between her and her husband. He confessed to everything and begged for her forgiveness. She told me that a while after thinking about it she agreed to give him another chance to keep their marriage and family intact. She told me that he said it was my sis who initiated the affair and she asked me if that's true to the best of my knowledge. I told her about my sister's lifestyle involving married men and said I'm 99.9% sure that she must have been the one who started the affair. She them told me that she and her husband are completely cutting all ties with my sis and I told her that I'm doing the same. I recommended that if they are planning on fixing their marriage they go to couple's therapy. She agreed and and then asked me if she and I could talk to and see each other more often. I told her that I will absolutely do that and I'm there for her if she needs me.

Then I called my sister and told her why my husband and I are cutting off all ties with her and that she should not try to interact with him,me or our children anymore and then I hung up. She hasn't called back since. Now, I'm only concentrating on Jane and how I can be a friend to her in her time of need.",2019-07-06 22:52:54,620,8427,relationship_advice
3,ca62qi,bigkyrososa,General Advice: You Don't Require Evidence/Confirmation to Leave Someone,"Just some general relationship advice after observing a trend on this sub over the past few months.

**Key takeaway**: People need to take responsibility over preserving and protecting their mental health.

If your SO is being shady or disrespectful, playing stupid games with you, and refuses to acknowledge or address your thoughts and feelings, when being approached/confronted on the matter (in a reasonable way), then that is sufficient grounds to leave them. In fact, you don't need to provide a reason to leave anyone. **You only need a reason for yourself.**

Please stop trying to seek out hard evidence or confirmation that'll ""catch them in the act"", and please stop embarrassing yourself by allowing your insecurity to take control over your actions, by breaching people's privacy (ex. snooping through texts and messages on your SO phone). It is completely normal and fine to feel insecure given the circumstances, don't let people shame you for feeling insecure when you are certain it's their specific actions which are creating and driving your feelings of insecurity and/or deteriorating trust for your SO, AND don't let your insecurity get the best of you. Be patient with yourself and take some time to recognize your insecurity and recognize what is driving it. This is a door that can lead you to a very bad place. 

What are you going to do when you catch your SO at his/her coworker house? Especially after a wild goose chase of trying to figure out why you guys aren't having sex, and why they're being emotionless/cold/disrespectful to you for x (let x be any amount of days/weeks/months) amount of time. We're all human and sometimes we let our emotions take control of us and sometimes these situations escalate into something worse - when they could have been avoided entirely. What people don't realize is that they fuel their own emotions when they try to seek out confirmation or evidence against their SO. The reality is, there are tons of red flags you dismissed before reaching this point which you should have taken into consideration. You shouldn't be making excuses for your SO's lack of respect for you or why you don't trust them. It is completely fine to leave someone at the first sighting of a red flag, and these matters don't need to go to the extreme cases. There are decent people out there who will never raise any red flags with you. 

What do you think you're doing to your mental health when you read sexually explicit texts between your SO and his/her ""don't worry, he's/she's just a friend/brother/sister/coworker""? Or what about texts where they really get into how they really feel about you? You think that isn't going to take a toll on your mental health and impact your future relationships (including current/existing relationships with friends and family)? Of course it is, in fact, you wouldn't be human if it didn't. The reality is, there are tons of better men or women out there who would never even having you feeling this way where you would pushed to a place where you need to invade their privacy since you don't trust them. You don't need to settle with a bad SO. You can leave them whenever you want, and it's always better to leave them before it's too late and you end up requiring therapy or counseling, or worse, you end up hurting someone else.

Please understand that there is someone better for you out there and you shouldn't compromise your mental health for the sake of a shitty person. Trust your intuition and end the relationship before problems escalate.",2019-07-07 11:58:29,39,202,relationship_advice
4,ca8eih,grizzythekid,I just found out that my daughter is not my daughter. What the heck am I supposed to do?,"So my SO of 4+ years just confessed that my daughter who is 2.5 yrs old is not my daughter.

I was really excited to do an ancestry test on her, not because I had doubts, but just because I figured my daughter could shine some light on my and my girlfriend's ancestry. So I did it, and the results came back..

I know I was born in Scotland, and I know my family's history maybe 4 generations past. All Scotland. When the results came back, there was zero match for Celtic, Anglo Saxon etc. I was so surprised and so confused, I was getting my phone out to call my mum, and my girlfriend burst out crying saying she had fucked up.

She confessed that I wasn't her father, and that she made a mistake when I was out of town for a hot minute 2.6 years ago.

I want to make clear that I love MY daughter. I raised her, on my own sometimes, and she means the world to me. I don't feel any I'll will towards her, and I feel like I want to take care of her the same way I always have.

Her mother though, I don't know. I feel like, for our daughters sake, maybe we should try to work it out. This is, to me, a massive betrayal, so I don't even know if that's fucking possible. It's like she took the shine off of my fucking joy.

I'm trying my hardest to see beyond what she's done. Trying so hard to feel and be the same to my wonderful baby girl, but my mind is stormy, and I'm fucking raging ATM. I've turned to the bottle to try chill out, but it's not working.",2019-07-07 16:03:19,83,69,relationship_advice
5,ca1g45,Prokkkk,UPDATE: Partner of 5 years asked me to be in an open relationship. I'm feeling completely broken and betrayed. I'm having a hard time figuring out what to do and advice is needed.,"Original Post: https://reddit.app.link/ZQ55Qqqi7X

Okay everyone.. here is the update for this story. This was a hell of a ride so hold on to your seat folks. I’ve tried to write this in as much detail as possible. If people have questions, please ask. I’ll update anything that I think is necessary if it comes up afterwards.

I’d like to say first that I don’t think I would have been able to do this nearly as well if I hadn’t received the tremendous support that I had received from everyone here. Even though I’m a complete wreck, I made it through and you’re all to thank. Since I’m not looking for advice (but feel free to give it), there will be a tldr at the bottom. 

So the last update was after I had told her that I was going to spend the night at my father’s house instead of going to another city with her for some festival I didn’t want to go to. I had to leave to go see some clients of mine and I would expect someone who had done nothing wrong to be shocked and try to fix the situation. She simply kept her head down and stayed quiet, save for an “okay”.

So I went about my day very stressed. I came back and got prepared for a big graduation for my sister that my partner was invited to as well. She was all dolled up so I figured that she was ready to go. As I was getting ready to head out I asked if she was ready to go. She replied with “I’m not coming. I’m going out.” As she was leaving I called out to ask if she would be home tonight. She didn’t answer. 

It was at this point that there was no doubt in my mind that she was cheating on me. This was so unlike our 5 years. I went to the graduation and when I got home, I decided I also wanted some proof. Not that it was going to change anything, but I still wanted it. She had told me many times that she shared her location with two of her friends (iPhone stuff, I have an android) whenever she went out, and I naively believed her. I contemplated requesting something unfair of one of them that we had lived with in the past to tell me her location and see if it was a house or a hotel or something to determine if she was cheating. Then I saw her laptop, which is a MacBook. 

In our relationship, we had very hard boundaries of personal space and would never invade the others. But I figured all boundaries had been broken so fuck it, here I went. I logged on to her laptop using the same few passwords she uses on everything. I open her messages and find messages from a few guys she had been talking to. The first conversation I found was with a guy who was very into polygamy and seemed really casual about the whole thing. As I scrolled up, I saw messages of him asking how this other guy was and she went on to describe it. So yes, she cheated on me (but wait it gets worse). 

I went and read the next conversation of a name I didn’t recognize. This was the one she had slept with. As I scrolled up through the conversation, what I was presented with was likeI had been kicked in the nuts of my emotions. What I found were messages about how she enjoyed how he dominated her and she enjoyed feeling him cum in her and it sliding down her throat. She talked about how she didn’t like how he was leaving bruises on her neck and butt and what not from their BDSM sex. 

As a side note, we had explored a lot of that together but it was always her cup of tea, not mine. I was happy to play along though because she enjoyed it. 

At this point I enter a fit of rage. I’m always cool as a cucumber, but I was just shy of breaking everything in sight. I almost texted her family from her laptop to tell them in their family group chat. I didn’t do it though. More on this in a reflection section later on. I texted her to tell her I’m back at our place and waiting for her and what time would she be home. She tried to give me some bullshit about how she was going to be out late and I didn’t need to wait up for her. I insisted multiple times and she said she would be home around 2 or 3 am. I said I would wait up and needed to talk to her. I had a number of people close to me calling me as they were helping me as I was figuring out what was going on (before I had posted on reddit). I was convinced I would kick her out when she got home. Through a few hours of people talking to me, I changed my mind and decided to head to my mom’s house with all of my stuff (I’m not materialistic so this was easy) and my cat. I told her not to bother coming back and her response was “I’ll still come back but if you’re just going to break up with me let me know over text”... I didn’t entertain that. 

Nothing exciting happens the rest of the night as I just stayed up with my mom until about 3 am and then woke up at about 730 to get the day going. I texted her to ask her what time she would be back today and she said she was going to be back at about 10:45. I said I would see her then and went over. I cleaned up the house a bit because it looked like a tornado had gone through as I was in a mad dash to grab my things. 

Enter her. I sat at the far end of our dining table while waiting for her. I decided I would record the whole conversation with an audio recorder on my phone so that if she tried to pull any nonsense, at least I’d have proof of what happened. She loves this cat immensely so I was expecting an explosion when she saw he wasn’t there.  Instead, she sat down fairly calmly at the table. I felt like my heart was going to pound right out of my chest it was beating so hard. I had prepared some questions that I wanted to get through so that I could stay on track in case I got emotional. The first thing I said was thanking her for all of our years together. I wanted her to know that I appreciated everything she had given me. The good, the bad, the ups, the downs, all of it.  

I then said “I’m going to give you one chance to tell me the truth”. 

“The truth about what” she responded. I continued to explain to her that I knew she had cheated on me. She explained that she stayed in a guest bedroom last night and didn’t sleep with the guy. There were a few back and forths before I said “I know you fucked (name) on (date). Why are you still lying about it?” Her demeaner changed a bit. She almost relaxed and finally said. “Yes, I cheated on you.” This didn’t really phase me as it’s not like it was news at this point. 

I continued to ask questions such as “when did you stop loving me?” and “when did you stop respecting me?”. 

At one point she asked me how I figured it out. I explained the logic as was very obvious thanks to all of you beautiful people. I did not tell her that I had posted the story to reddit, however. I then said “you know I believe in open honesty.. so here goes: I went on to your laptop and read all your messages last night.” 

Her face almost went pale. She seemed initially shocked and angry, but then devastated that I read all of it. There was a lot of crying throughout this conversation, by the way. Finally, all cards were on the table. She explained her side of the story, which summarizes down to she is emotionally messed up and wanted to stop feeling depressed and sad as she has for the last 23 years (treat your kids kindly people, it seriously fucks them up). She turned off all emotions to stop feeling so bad all of the time and wanted to be free to make whatever decision she wants. 

The rest is a bit of a blur, unfortunately. Somewhere in there I explained how I would never want to hurt her, or anyone for that matter, the way she has hurt me. She asked that she could call my mom, who had adopted her as a child to say goodbye. I agreed and my mom was very polite and said: “I loved you like a daughter. I hope you get the help you need someday.” It’s important to understand some dynamics here: her mother was never there for her. She (mother) stood by as her father beat her. To have my mother, who is kind, genuine, caring, giving, and an incredible human being adopt you as her own, and then to lose that... I can’t imagine. Luckily her emotions are off so I douubt she felt the full brunt of it. Partner then asked if I would avoid telling everyone that she had cheated on me. I said no, I would tell them that she cheated on me. 

I cannot describe the pain I’ve felt this week, especially today. We ended things rather civilly and without animosity, which is a huge success in my books considering what she did. She paid me money she owed me, handed my car keys back, and we discussed the lease agreement we had signed. We have to give 2 months notice to break the contract. I still love her so much, and am still being more kind to her than she deserves, and I understand that. So no, you don’t need to tell me I’m being too nice to her, because I know. We agreed that we didn’t know how we would exactly execute this, but there are a lot of options. Since she did such a terrible thing to me, I’d be the one to make the decisions and she could live with whatever I decided. We agreed that 3 weeks was a hard cap on how long she had to find a new place, sign, and get out. It’s a tough time of year to find anywhere, so I agreed to a bit longer. Yes, I could have just kicked her onto the street with all of her stuff. No, that is not the solution here. I’m not sure where I will live, but I’ve moved out and she can stay there unless I decide otherwise.  I’m not sure I want to be there. 

We spent a few hours just talking afterwards, as individuals. We talked about life; the past and the future. What we’ve learned, and what we want to learn. It was actually really nice to have the weight of relationship expectations to be dropped and just be individuals who are sharing. I hadn’t realized how heavy the relationship was on me until this point. 

Thanks for reading my book. 

REFLECTION TIME

She had to go to a wedding and I ate alone at our dining table. Every single inch of space reminds me of her. We completely redid the place when we moved in and refurbished old furniture we found for cheap. I don’t know that I can ever live there again without immense pains. I’m doing alright. I have an incredible support circle that is so amazing to me. Her friends that she has told now are coming to me and I think they lost all respect for her they had.  Even her support is leaving her and supporting me. I will be okay. I will be stronger on the other side of this, I have no doubt about it. 

Some people will likely read this and think “why would he be so kind to her? Take it all and tell her to get lost.” I mean.. Yes, but no. She’s very damaged and still another human being, no matter how much hurt she has caused me. She damaged me because of her damage, and therefore we both need healing. No one has ever healed through war, anger, or violence. The world needs more kindness, not less. An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind, you know? Through her actions, she has lost a lover, a best friend, a confidant, a support, a crutch, a rock, and a partner. She has lost a loving mother and father, a sister and brother, neices and nephews, and her cat. She has lost almost all of her friends. She does not need to also be kicked onto the street, no matter how much pain she has caused me. No matter how much I may feel hatred for her, I know she hates herself more. 

What is currently paining me the most is taking our (my) cat. Even though she shut off and I have no idea what’s real from her, I KNOW she loves this cat immensely. He is her entire world, just as she was mine. So I feel for her that she has lost him. I offered to arrange for it so that she could say goodbye to him, but she declined saying it would just be too hard and it was easier this way. I don’t think I’ll ever give him up unless for some reason I can’t care for him, in which case I would definitely reach out to her and have her take him. I don’t plan on giving him up, so don’t worry about that. I don’t want to feel bad for her that I’ve taken him, but I can’t help it. Love is crazy. 

Thank you everyone who has read this. I made it as descriptive as possible, both for you and for me. It was very therapeutic for me to write this. I think I may take up writing more. Thank you for everyone’s support yesterday. You gave me the extra strength I needed to make a decision, and it was the right one. 

If there’s one thing I can ask of each of you reading this, please spread one single bit of kindness each day. The world could use it. 

TL;DR - Partner of 5 years cheated on me and lied to my face about it. With the help of reddit and journaling everything immediately after the fact, I was able to see what was happening. I found texts that horrify me to think about on her laptop which I checked because of the extenuating circumstances. When confonted, she denied it until I basically hit her in the face with evidence. My life is in pieces, but I will be stronger on the other side.

Edit: There have been a few comments about this being fake so I want to address that. I wrote it like a story so that it would be not just a huge wall of text that’s poorly written and hard to get through, and because I enjoy writing and this was therapeutic for me. If you don’t want to believe my story of what happened, that’s fine, power to you. If I just wanted to write a story or karma whore, I wouldn’t come to this subreddit to do that. If I could share the pain I’ve felt with you and have you feel even a fraction of it, then I think you’d very quickly stop shitting on this part of me I’ve shared.",2019-07-07 01:39:43,161,724,relationship_advice
6,c9xveg,ozzymomo123,"[UPDATE] Me [18M] and 9 other friends [18M] on holiday in Spain. One friend won't pay for the Villa, as he came last minute as a replacement. Shall we kick him out? [UPDATE]","Okay so I listened to everyone who commented, and discussed all of it with the rest of my friends. 

Thank you all for the advice. 

We were all upstairs around a table and some chairs / sofa. We called him upstairs, and I think he knew what was coming because he seemed already pissed off. 

I started off by explaining by trying to calmly explain the situation with him having to pay, but then was immediately cut off by someone saying ""Yo you have to pay us £250 for the Villa."" Obviously he got pissed at this. 

We were arguing / discussing / whatever it was non - stop for well over half an hour. It was kinda heated not gonna lie. 

He handled it really well, and I admit it was really sly of us to all sort of ""gang up"" on him, because I've been in that situation before and it feels really bad. So I tried to keep everything calm. 

Basically there was a bit more to the story, since the 2 people organising this trip to Spain, basically didn't fill the rest of us in on some essential stuff. 

Like for example, the amount Mark got refunded was only £100, whereas the price of the Villa was £250. But the thing is, the 2 people organising it apparently ""agreed"" that it's fine for him to stay, and this is where the confusion comes in, because they say they didn't. Essentially, when we were still planning the holiday, Mark apparently already asked these 2 people if it's okay for him to cancel the apartment and come in our villa, and they said yes but none of them set prices and shit straight from the start. 

Mark's point is, he's taking Harry's spot, so why should he pay, since, if he wasn't there, the refundable deposit would go to Harry either way? 

This is probably confusing and it's hard to explain since it was a very lengthy and heated engagement so I'm not sure how to explain absolutely everything, so that's the jist of it. 

Harry, who cancelled, was going to get all of the refundable deposit. We asked Mark to pay for staying in the villa, and he said no. 

We asked him in many different ways, and he raised some valid points, but still said No. Also, he has thousands of pounds, so paying that wasn't the problem. 

He just didn't want to pay. 

So, we listened to all of you, and told him he can't sleep in the villa if he's not paying because it's not fair on everyone else. He was pissed, and we even had to ring some of our friends back home to clear up some more shit that was there due to poor organising and lack of communication. 

So, I suggested instead of £250 he pay £145, which is how much it would cost to stay in the villa for the remainder of the holiday. The reason I said this is because we did bring it up with him 3 days into the holiday, so it's unfair of us to expect him to pay the full amount. 

He didn't want to pay it. Eventually, and I mean eventually, we decided that he's going to stay in the apartment that those 2 other people rented out that is near our Villa. He will pay them for staying in the apartment, as it's cheaper than our Villa, only around £100. 

Everything is awkward as fuck and I'm fearing that the holiday may be ruined because of this. I felt so bad after for all of us ""ganging up"" on him, because that's pretty much what it was. I've been on the other side, and I know how it feels like. 

So, I offered to pay the £45 for him, and he only pays £100. At this point he was packing his suitcase and everything so he still declined and said he didn't want to stay with people who didn't want him there anyway. 

We all tried to stress how it's not personal, and we aren't doing it on purpose. I felt bad after so I went to him individually and just said sorry essentially for all of us ganging up on him, and we aren't doing it just for the sake of it. 

So he packed, and he's staying elsewhere, like you guys said he should. So thank you. 

In the meantime we just went to the beach to try kill the tension and any awkwardness between us, it's working slowly but surely. 

Thanks again and happy holidays to everyone :)",2019-07-06 19:56:02,392,2042,relationship_advice
7,ca5bvw,anonymous_throaway22,Update: I [23F] just found out my husband [38M] has been hiding his child from me,"For those of you that were curious, I reached out to an old prof of mine and sent some resumes out and am continuing to send them out. I’ve also told my friends and family that I’m going to get a divorce. Most were supportive as soon as I told them. My parents still think I should go to counseling to see if we can fix things but they’re supportive of me and said that they would be happy to have me back until I got on my feet again. For those of you saying that my parents were somehow profiting off of my marriage, that’s not true at all. My parents have had some health problems and my husband helped them find specialists and explained all the medical jargon and really helped them through some tough times.
Anyway, when it came to my husband, despite all of your warnings, I did contact a couple lawyers but I didn’t feel great about it. I know it sounds ridiculous but going behind his back and contacting people who seemed way too eager to help me end the marriage somehow made me feel sneaky, but it didn’t even matter because as soon as I told my husband I needed to talk to him about something, he told me everything. About how he didn’t mean for things to end up this way, he’s sorry he hurt me, he does love me but he understands that I could never believe him because of what he’s put me through. He was sincere and remorseful, but I realized that what I thought was love, was just an infatuation and the past week has shown me that. 
I told him I couldn’t be with him any longer, that I had already started looking for jobs and was planning on moving back with my parents. He’s agreed to let me keep my car and he said he had some money saved up for a trip for us that he never got around to using and said that I could have it. I refused but he insisted. He also let me keep my credit card for emergencies until I got back on my feet but I’m not sure how I feel about taking that. He offered to set me up in an apartment until I could afford to pay my own rent but I declined that. 
I’ll be moving out of here by next week and my husband has seen a lawyer about filing for divorce. He’s also strongly suggested that I find one as well so he or she can help me navigate the legal process so I’ve been looking into that. He said he would be willing to give me half of his salary for the three years that we were married and I agreed to that. So that’s that...thank you to anyone that cared",2019-07-07 10:12:10,29,92,relationship_advice

9,ca5r9i,Autumnisbestimo,Married 10 years and I think my wife regrets it (30M 30F),"How crazy am I to be posting this to a public board... maybe it'll get lost in the sea of posts.  


So I have two kids and both my kids have high functioning autism my wife and I recently realized that I most likely am as well. We're high school sweethearts and have been together 14 years and have had a pretty easy going marriage. We communicate well and have no secrets. However recently she let me know that she feels bad because she resents me for the kids autism and that she's unhappy with our marriage because I'm not social enough for her. Part of being autistic is not having any real social skills. I can pretend and get along well with people but I just don't have an interest or drive in being in crowds or having networks of friends.

  
She recently went to a wedding back in her home town by herself and met up with an old crush, they hung out and clicked very well. She let me know that she was close to sleeping with him and thought heavily about about it regardless what it would have done to our relationship but she didn't because she didn't want to ruin the kids lives. She's back in town now and still talks to him on a regular basis and lets me know that it's just ""easier to talk to him"". I let her know that it makes me uncomfortable but she's made it clear that she's probably going to continue talking to him anyways. She says there's no risk to us and that she's still happy with me.  


So, I need some advice from outside the family and marriage, should I cut my losses and let her go live the life she wants or continue to try to make it work knowing that she'll likely resent me?

Thank you everyone for your replies.

I hadn’t talked to anyone about this and was drowning in my own sorrow. After reading this, I called some friends, told them what happened and they made me snap out of it.

I honestly don’t know how I was so bind, I was not thinking rationally. I was pathetic and did the worst thing possible crawling back to her. I now realize that the woman I fell in love with and was trying to cling to is not the same person that she is today, and that I do not like, or want to be with the person she is today, independent of what happens with the other guy.

I got some legal advice, and tomorrow I will make her a proposal to see if we can reach a mutual agreement (simpler process) regarding finances (properties, debt, alimony) and regarding the kids. If she doesn’t accept the proposal I will file it unilaterally.",2019-07-07 17:45:07,6,20,relationship_advice

12,ca74vp,throwaway190707,My parents prefer my sister (25/F) over me (28/F) and it's really bothering me.,"I may sound like a whiner, but it's bothering me so much and I can't let it go.

I have 3 siblings, I'm the eldest at 28, and then there's my sister at 25, another sister at 17, and a brother who is 5. We have my parents, mum and dad. Dad isn't bio father to eldest 3. I'm going to refer to my younger siblings as their ages. If this doesn't work, let me know. 

Quick backstory: I had a very traumatic childhood which has left me a depressed, anxious mess. I had to move out at a young age because my sister was physically hurting me (she later admitted to doing this on purpose to get me out. She said this whilst laughing.)

Me and 25 are older, we are both in marriages, both of us are parents (my kiddo is 4 (and disabled), hers is 3mos.) 

When I had my kiddo, my parents were involved, but having a young baby themselves, they weren't around as much as they could be. I have hardly any photos of my kiddo with my parents and honestly it makes me sad. When my sister's baby was born, my parents couldn't do enough for her, they're going on day trips, constantly babysitting, spending so much time with my sister and her little family. My sister can just go around my parents house whenever they like, I on the other hand, have to call up and see if they're free. My parents always offer to babysit their baby, but never offer to babysit my kiddo. They've flat out refused when I've asked them to before, but never have they refused my sister. 

My sister constantly posts pictures and things on Facebook about what she's doing with my parents, knowing full well I wasn't invited to do whatever they were doing. Going for family picnics, day trips, the lot. 

My sister can scream in my face, belittle me, reduce me to tears and nothing is said. They act like nothing happened. I raise my voice, I speak up about how she's made me upset, and I'm the monster. 

17yo messaged me and told me that my parents, inc 5yo, and my sister and her little family are actually on holiday all together right now. I had no idea, no clue that they were planning this. 

I'm just in floods of tears. I can't help but feel like I'm just a mistake, that they like to pretend that I don't exist, when I'm having a mental health crisis I'm ""attention seeking"" (once messaged our group chat that I'm having a crisis and they left the group). I'm a mistake because I didn't give them their ""perfect neurotypical grandchild"", and now they have one, me and my kiddo don't matter at all. I'm a mistake because I'm not the perfect daughter. 

I'm feeling rather low, reddit.

Update: I'm going to chase up my therapist. I'm supposed to be seeing him again soon but I'm on a waiting list (love the NHS honestly but mental health services are so under funded!) I'm going to try and appeal to be bumped up the list a bit, as I need help with other things, too. I can't afford to go private unfortunately but if the waiting list is too long, I'm going to look into it. 

Thank you to all of you who have shown me love and validation. I really needed it, thank you.",2019-07-07 14:02:12,30,34,relationship_advice
13,c9wdf0,beatrixkivo,I [32F] just dropped out of my sisters[30F] wedding as her MOH after a blowout fight because her fiancé[40M] called me cheap,"Long story short they got engaged in March. He comes from a large traditional European household where money is a big thing for their wedding events. Throughout all of there wedding things I’ve been there for my sister every step of the way, helping in any way I can. I’ve spent well over a grand just being present in her wedding party trying to keep up. Both of them have good paying jobs and his family comes from a very well off household. I have one part time job and my parents aren’t exactly considered “well off.”

Obviously my contributions are no where near what his family is used to but I thought giving what I could and putting in extra leg work would be enough maybe? 

Anyways, for her shower I spent around 200$ and made her a 7ft x 6ft backdrop as a gift because it’s something that she really wanted. It took over three months to make it by hand. The other girls in her wedding party are all from his side of the family and are what I could only describe as prissy rich girls. Every time I try and make a suggestion that’s cheaper for an event or something contributing to their wedding I get snubbed or ignored. No other bridesmaids have even lifted a finger to help my sister other than make bougie ass opinions on what she should do or be(which is not her). I’ve felt pretty left out in this whole process but didn’t want to say anything because although I don’t agree with how things are going, I want them to be happy because I love them. 

So today I went to my sister and her fiancés house for coffee. And her fiancé made a snarky comment about how I didn’t give them an envelope of money at her shower. I said my gift was their backdrop and I thought that was okay. I reminded him that I’m only working about 20 hours a week right now and I can barely afford to pay my bills(I got laid off in January from my second job I had). He then preceded to say that his dad keeps a chart of how much everyone contributes to them and they had to lie otherwise he would of gotten pissed. I thought this was absolutely atrocious. I told him that weddings aren’t about money. They are about love and family. And I’ve even known people that have gotten married and accepted zero gifts and just wanted to be surrounded by the people they cared about to celebrate their love. 

We went back and fourth for a few until I felt so overwhelmed I left and said I don’t want to be a part of this anymore. I electronically transferred my sister money from my credit card and now I can’t pay my gas bill and told her I don’t want to talk anymore. Maybe I overreacted but I was really upset. She’s texted me a few times and says she doesn’t want my money but I can’t even right now. She said that their traditions aren’t like ours and I said I’m not the one getting married so sorry for offending anyone’s traditions so take what I gave you and count me out of anything else. 

I feel terrible. His family has completely taken over their entire wedding and has completely omitted our traditions as it is and now I’m expected to pay hundreds of dollars more than a thousand I’ve already spent for something I don’t even want to be a part of anymore. I love my sister but she hasn’t once stood up for me or our family(and our traditions) and I’m seeing her change right in front of me and it makes me so upset. 

I don’t know what to do now or where to go from here. She’s my only sister and I’m sure this will be her only wedding and I feel like I’ve just ruined everything. 

TL;DR I’m going broke being apart of my sisters wedding. Her fiancé called me cheap, we all got into it and I stormed out crying because I don’t feel good enough. Having regrets now. Help.

***************************************

**EDIT:** For all that were asking, his family is Serbian. And traditionally in his family they go to a lot of weddings and other events in their lifetime(seems like they have something going on almost every weekend for someone or something). His dad keeps a chart to keep track of how much money is given out so he can balance what they get in return. And **NO**, I do not agree with this. 

**EDIT 2:** My sister showed up at my house last night and apologized. She returned the money I transferred her and spoke with her fiancé. She said she wouldn’t tolerate anything like this between our families. She let me know after speaking with her future husband that it’s okay and will be okay if I can only give so much for the remaining duration of the wedding as she knows it’s been a rough go for me this past year financially. She said he felt bad as we’ve all known each other for over 8 years and he wants to talk as he just reacted under the stress of his parents. I told her I needed some time away but I will still be her MOH. She said she understood why I was so upset and she will do her best to stand up for our family in the future. She admitted to getting lost in everything going on and was only trying to keep everyone happy.

2. Just to clear the air, i’m not a fucking bum. I’ve worked 3 jobs more than 12 hours a day for over 5 years. I paid my own way through school and everything I have, is the result of my own hard work and efforts. It’s been more or less bad luck with job stuff this past year and I just now(as of last week) I have a second job again but it’ll take time to catch up on things financially.",2019-07-06 17:46:12,243,1394,relationship_advice
14,ca4k67,dk206,Girlfriend argues I'm just insecure after complaining about comments she made with friends,"So my (33M) girlfriend (31F) had a promiscuous past and is very open about it (about 50 partners). Mine not so much, but it's in her past, and made her who she is today. I told her I want to know about her past, except for explicit details. Today, we were out with about 10 of her closest friends (1/2 guys and girls) somehow we got on topic of penises (drinking cocktails for a while), and she said something along the lines of ""Well, I know I've definitely found the limit of what's too big"". Later that day the same story was referenced again, and she said ""Well, one of the biggest penises I've seen was a geeky guy, which was a surprise, but the biggest was the Mexican guy I dated."" Mind you, she's the only one out of about 10 people that made this type of comment both times.

On the car ride home I told her how I didn't like that. I feel this crossed the line both times, and makes me have a hard time not thinking about it. She said it's just normal talk with their friends and there's no need to feeling insecure.

15,c9spf7,ozzymomo123,"Me [18M] and 9 other friends [18M] on holiday in Spain. One friend won't pay for the Villa, as he came last minute as a replacement. Shall we kick him out?","Okay so it's essentially the title but I'll try to explain it as best as I can. Names have been changed. 


There are 10 of us in total. 8 of us in the Villa, and 2 have an apartment near our Villa. 


1) Harry was going to come. 


2) Harry cancelled around 1 week before we were going to come, so we didn't know until then that he wasn't going to come. 

3) Zack was going to come. 


4) Zack cancelled around 1 month before we were going to come, so we had plenty of time to find a replacement. 


5) Hank and Mark replaced them but none of us were told, one guy literally invited them out of nowhere, and none of us are that close with both of them. They both said Yes. 


6) He asked them both, even though at that time only Zack had cancelled. They both said Yes, so they decided Hank stay in the Villa, and Mark would get an apartment near us as well. 


7) Hank is replacing Zack. At this point we didn't know Harry wasn't coming. 


8) Hank is booked in for the villa, he pays all the money like everyone else (£240 just for Villa for 1 week). 


9) As we didn't know Harry was going to cancel, Mark books his own little apartment near to the other 2 people. 


10) Harry cancels around 1 week before we're about to leave. 


11) Without the rest of us knowing Mark refund his apartment, and decides to just stay in our villa, even though we've told the villa owner there's 7 of us only, since Harry cancelled. 


12) We had to show and sign documents showing our passports, and documentation basically to confirm there is only 7 of us staying in the villa. 


13) So, the only thing Mark has paid for is is own flight which is £160. 


14) So, he needs to pay around £240 for staying in the villa for 1 week, like everyone else has.
 

15) The rest of us only found out yesterday that he hasn't paid, but he's already said to 2 other people, he's not gonna pay because ""ITS EASIER FOR ME"". 


16) He goes ""I'm doing you guys a favour by taking the extra spot that Harry was gonna go on"" ?!?!?!


17) Also, basically because Harry isn't coming we all decided to do something nice and all give him the refundable deposit for the villa which was £250 which means between us we are paying like £35 for the deposit. By doing this we are minimising the amount of money he loses, since some of the things he paid was non-refundable.  


18) If you think about it, if Mark paid, we would all get our deposit back. But he's not, and the deposit that's going to Hank, is covering £250 worth of the shit at the villa. The villa that Mark is staying at free of charge because it's ""easier"". 


19) So we are literally paying £250 to Mark essentially  and he is saying ""im doing you guys a favour"". We are basically paying for his holiday, and losing money ourselves. 


20) So yeah we are going to ask him to pay later on otherwise he's not staying in the villa he can actually fuck off and find some other accommodation. Do you think that's fair? But we really don't want to put him out on the streets, but we don't know how else to get him to pay. 


21) If he says he will pay after the holiday, he literally and simply just won't, he will be lying, and after the holiday is done there's nothing that we can do really. 


22) How can we get him to pay? If he pays that means we can all get our refundable deposit back too, which is around £35 per person which would be nice too. 


23) 2 people have asked him to pay already, and he told them all to Fuck Off. We know for a fact that he has the money, so that's not the issue. He himself has money in his account, and his family is also decently well off, like not poor or anything. 

EDIT : Some confusion, we are in Spain right now. It's been 3 of our 7 days. 


What can we do? HOW CAN WE GET HIM TO PAY?

17,ca4d4z,Passionate_Sunday,"I(34m) ""ruined"" the family vacation after my uncle(47m) displayed inappropriate and outrageous behavior to my girlfriend(24f) how can I make this up to everyone involved in the afterward clash?","
I've been away for 2 weeks and it was a lovely little trip with my girlfriend and a group of my family members. Cousin, uncle and my parents. 

So, the sleeping arrangements were a bit....cramped it was a one bedroom since my parents initially planned on it just being them, till they realized they'd be bored and would get lonely. 

My girlfriend and I slept on a couch, very uncomfortable process, ecstatic to be home in our bed again. 

My uncle and his son shared an air mattress. And, my parents had the actual bedroom to themselves. 

During this trip my girlfriend met my uncle for the first time, I hyped him up as he was the ""cool"" uncle between him and my other uncle. 

We spent a lot of time by the pool, my girlfriend is an avid swimmer and so is my cousin so they had a blast. I worked on my tan mostly. 

My uncle is always on his phone. Whether he's playing Pokemon Go, watching anime, or on TikTok. He's consistently on his phone. I thought nothing of it. 

As I flop over to get my stomach nice and crisp, I see him on his phone(I'm wearing sunglasses) So, I see he's taking pictures OF MY GIRLFRIEND. 

Not, a picture of her and his son. No, literally a picture, zoomed in on her bikini top, then of her feet and her butt when she's moving to the hot tub with my cousin. 

I wanted to explode right there, but, I didn't want to ruin the vacation either. I held my tongue and took my girlfriend to get ice cream, go play the arcade, and do some mini golf. 

We get back to the room pretty late, around 11pm-Midnight. We're quiet, we take a shower together and get ready for bed. 

My girlfriend passes out almost immediately I can't sleep, so, I'm watching some documentary on my phone and time escapes me. 

5am hits, I see my uncle get up, eat a bowl of cereal, lay back on the air mattress. Then, casual start jerking off to the pics of my girlfriend at the pool.

It was a very surreal and one of the most uncomfortable experiences of my entire life. So, I decided to just, fake cough and I see him drop his phone and pretend to sleep. 

I wanted to grab his phone and delete all the pictures asap, but, he knew I was awake now and I knew he was just jacking off to them.

Fast forward to the next night where my dad, uncle, me, and my girlfriend are out drinking for the 4th of July. My girlfriend isn't a big drinker.

I drink a few beers, my dad throws two or three back before he's taking the signature dad nap in the lawn chair. My uncle gets absolutely sloshed as he's drinking whiskey, rum, moonshine. And is practically begging my girlfriend to drink some. 

She insists on her water, but my uncle is relentless until he angrily leaves for a while. I feel so guilty that I didn't tell her everything in that moment. 

Time passes, we still have 3-4 hours before the fireworks start and my girlfriend decides to nap in the room. 

I lay down with her for a little bit before my dad asked me to help set up for the grilling out at the community grill spot at the resort.

I thought I grabbed everything, but, I forgot the cheese so I open the door and see my uncle hovering over my sleeping girlfriend, trying to slyly pull her blanket off. 

This is where I mini explode and yell ""Mike, wtf are you doing?!?"" 

He nearly falls over, taking my girlfriend down by her blanket, then she wakes up and rubs her eyes like ""what's happening?"" 

I get in my uncles face, tell him what a POS he is and how he should be ashamed of himself for his outrageous, predatory, and inexcusable behavior towards my girlfriend, since he's already married, and should fap to his wife, porn pictures/videos online or literally anything else.

My mom stumbles in the room and smacks us both with her cane and demands to know what's going on. My girlfriend is also wanting to know what's up. So, I tell them both everything. 

My mom scolds my uncle, and me, while profusely apologizing to my girlfriend who I can tell is upset, as, anyone would be. 

Tensions are high, but, we eat dinner, watch the fireworks and continue on with our holiday. 

We went to the amusement park a few says later  where I dragged my girlfriend on rollarcoasters as per a deal she made ""Whatever ride you wanna go on, I'll do it."" 

My uncle and I had more spats at the theme park after his behavior didn't end. But, my girlfriend would just pull me back from the altercation and have me ride a coaster. 

My mom frequently says I ""ruined"" the vacation, my dad said he enjoyed himself, despite all of this. My girlfriend even said she had a great time excluding the creepiness. 

I feel guilty, but, at the same time I did the right thing, right? I want to make it up to my parents at least. I didn't want to ruin the vacation for them. 

I just couldn't stand by any longer and let a relative harass and prey on my girlfriend. I don't know what I should do now.",2019-07-07 07:41:49,66,70,relationship_advice
18,ca4h4k,Sullensirens,Brother [223 leaves everything in his will to girlfriend [21] of not even a year.,"So my idiot brother gets his first girlfriend and leaves everything in the will to her. She knows and is super proud of the fact. I'm afraid he's going to get murdered since she's been a little shady about other guys from what he's told us and she knows some people that rub me the wrong way. All they do together is get high to the point that he's been missing for days.

19,ca6k03,AntiqueOven,my [31f] husband [31m] wants me to quit my sidegig and stop going to my workout classes. i don't want to and i think he is overreacting.,"**background:**

we live in a more expensive part of the USA (won't disclose for anonymity purposes) but basically even with our two salaries combined the majority of our income goes towards mortgage, taxes, and bills, with just a little left over each month to save.

i have been working side gigs for a few years and really enjoy them. they're low-stress, offer me some human interaction time (my full-time job is mostly remote in front of a computer) and those extra few hundred bucks every few weeks actually makes a pretty big difference. my side gig is super close to home (like 5 minute drive) and pretty flexible with hours.

i realize i don't technically need to work a second job, but i enjoy it and there are some other perks that come with the job (i.e. free services for employees that are usually pretty expensive) that make it worth my while.

my husband works a job that offers overtime pay which he takes advantage of a lot because we do not have children. so, he works 7 days a week most of the time, voluntarily, in order to get overtime pay.

tl;dr: my husband and i both work full-time jobs, but i like working side gigs for a multitude of reasons

**issue:**

lately, my husband has gotten more and more vocal regarding the side gig. he constantly complains about how ""he never sees me anymore"" even though this side job is, like i said, very close to home and i only work there 10-12 hours a week. he says there is no point working a ""loser minimum wage job"" (his words, not mine) when i have a good career already, even though he has fully admitted that the extra money DOES help.

going along with that, i take workout classes at a local gym a few nights a week and he's started complaining about those as well. saying they take up too much of my time and, again, ""he never sees me anymore."" i'm going for maybe an hour, not all night.

it has caused some very heated discussions that usually culminate in him accusing me of avoiding his friends and family on purpose and now ""everyone hates me"" because ""they know what i'm doing."" (read: avoiding them)

(side note: my husband has missed literally ALL of my family functions over the last 6 months. niece's recitals, birthday parties, get-togethers. the last family event he went to was my grandmother's funeral. seriously. sometimes he is legitimately working and that's fine with me, but there have been times he has told me to tell my family he's working because he doesn't want to go. i never really complain about it though because lately when he does to go family events he doesn't really talk to anyone and acts like its the biggest inconvenience in the world to be there.)

he decided to go out with friends last night and when he came home he told me all our friends were making fun of me for working a ""loser minimum wage job"" and i asked him who said those things so i can address them with those people myself, and then he backtracked and said nobody really said those things but he could tell that was what they were all thinking...*eyeroll*

when i do have nights off or spend the day with him, he usually ends up falling asleep on the couch or having a ""boys night"" with his guy friends, so i am home alone anyway.

to me, he is making mountains out of molehills here. i've told him he can't guilt trip me and i'm a 31 year old woman and i can have mature discussions but i won't tolerate someone slinging immature accusations at me. but honestly the complaints are getting to a point where im starting to feel resentful towards him and his childish behavior, and i know that's not healthy either. 

**advice:**

so, in my mind, i guess there's three options:

1. quit the job so he stops complaining
2. ask my manager to reduce my hours so i still have the extra income
3. keep working and tell my husband to stop trying to tell me what to do with my life

the first thing that comes to mind is going to my manager and telling him to maybe cut one of my days, but i really don't have a legitimate reason other than ""my husband wants me to"" which just sounds.... awful. i don't want to quit completely, but maybe there's a compromise somewhere in here.

honestly, i can't even believe i'm writing this post because this is legitimately embarrassing and dumb to me.

20,ca9usb,Solemn-And-Sweet,I [34M] reached a breaking-point with my wife [34F] and need an exit strategy,"I've completely collapsed as a person. 

I want to preface everything by saying I love my wife, and I'm not blaming her for anything, but the culmination of everything has really crushed me into the ground.

We got married relatively young 10 years ago. At the time she told me she was getting her masters in microbiology and wanted to become a researcher. I come from an immigrant family, and I'm a second generation US citizen. She's from Europe. So I valued the idea of living in a 2 income household, especially since the cost of living is only going up. 

Fast forward 6 months into our marriage, and I'm at work trying to help her with her resume on my downtime. She's been having a hard time getting a job. Suddenly, she texts me that she lied and that she has no masters or bachelors degree, and didn't want me to cancel our wedding, so she hid it from me.

I was crushed, but I loved her, and was able to move past it, telling her that I'll actually pay for her to go to college. I was willing to struggle to get her through college, and work to build each other up. 

Nobody is perfect, and she has a lot of redeeming qualities. That's why I've stayed with her for as long as I have.

A combination of immigration issues getting a green card, her parents deaths and financial issues put her educational pursuits on pause intermittently the past few years. 

Despite all this, everything changed these past 6 months. She has made no effort in school, and basically looks like she has no aspiration to become a partner in this relationship with me. 

When I realized last night that she doesn't want to graduate and get a job I was crushed. I had it out with her and told her how I felt, and said I want a divorce.

All she could muster up was an ok, and she went to the bathroom and cried for 30 min, came back and went to sleep.

I genuinely feel that she's not talking to me because I'm right and there's nothing left to say.

Was I wrong to lay everything out the way I did?

I don't want to be married to someone who doesn't want to build me up the same way I build them up.

A major point of contention is I haven't taken a vacation in 6 years, putting all that money into her education and family emergencies instead of ourselves. Now she wants to go visit her relatives in Europe while I stay behind a 7th year in a row because I can't afford our goals vacationing at the moment. I accused her of not looking at my interests while I constantly look out for hers. She shutdown on me, and isn't speaking anymore.

Was I wrong to point that out too?

&amp;#x200B;

So my brother will be very loud every day because he is playing online games while talking to his friends. This especially happens in the evening, and also at nights (Weekends and weekdays). He will usually play till 3-4AM, while screaming, laughing and shouting very loudly.

I also have migraines, I get them about 2-3x a week, so I really need my sleep. And also during a migraine, I need to sleep, but it doesn't work because my brother will be extremely loud. I stand up about 3-4times a night, telling him to be quiet, but he always continues being loud. I've tried turning the wifi off, but he will usually just turn it on again and continue and it just gets me frustrated. 

I've talked to my parents, they tell me they are annoyed, yet they won't do anything as much as I ask them to.

So I'm asking you guys if you have any advice for me, maybe you have had a similar experience with your siblings being loud and you found a solution.

She messaged me multiple times on different social medias and all my friends multiple times. I chose to stay with him and thought she was a liar. He eventually broke up with me. 

Yesterday she messaged my new boyfriend. She told him that I’m an idiot and to watch out for my ex boyfriend because he has no morals. She told him the situation and said he has no problem seeing people if they have a boyfriend and think cheating is okay. She even said that he can treat me as badly as he wants because I’ll put up with it and stay because strangers have more self respect for me than I do.

23,ca90po,myosinclair,My (25M) girlfriend (21F) has a troubling relationship with sex,"To be concise, my gf lost her virginity to rape by her bf in high school. I believe this is the main cause of this problem, and I'm not sure how to approach it going forward. We've been together for about 6 months and the sex has been frequent and good. However, I nearly always have to initiate, and even though she is responsive and playful, I feel disinterest from her a lot. To the point where I've been minutes into oral or foreplay and felt so little in return that I've stopped altogether, without an effort from her to continue. Which is fine. I'm not always in the mood either. Communication can definitely be improved.

But last night, I started to heat up and begin to play, and when I was maybe 5 minutes into cunnulingus, she started to cry. Not sobbing, but wiping her eyes and apologizing. I pulled the covers over us and we spooned until we fell asleep.

That sort of clarified to me that she has a deeper problem than I was aware. I'm concerned because I have a very sexual temperament, and she does not at all. I'm concerned that this might not improve over time. I love this girl. She's absolutely gorgeous inside and out. We have so much in common. I enjoy all of the time we spend together. What can I do or say to make sure I'm upholding my end of the bargain (our relationship)? I told her she can always say no, and to never participate if she's uncomfortable. But I know there isn't a way to rectify. She does see a therapist, but I don't know if she's discussed this. Does anyone here have experience with something similar? Can this situation improve as we grow closer together? Any advice is sincerely appreciated...",2019-07-07 16:58:39,0,8,relationship_advice
24,ca7tbf,-SquidLord-,I [19F] can’t help but feel like I’m cheating on my ex?,"I left my ex about four months ago. Even though I still miss who he was (or rather, who he pretended to be) I don’t miss the angry, manipulative person he showed me towards the end, or the continuous anxious feeling I had when we were together. The only reason it took me so long to call it quits was because he’d sometimes show that same ‘sweet’ guy, and because of how kind his family were to me; also, he’d get really upset when I’d try to break up with him, and I couldn’t bring myself to do it. 

Anyway, it’s summer, I’m feeling good. Spending time with family and friends, having a nice break, got some fun things planned and I should be relaxed. The other day a friend of mine took me to an exhibition where a scientist was very chatty and flirty. It was fun talking to him, but I couldn’t shake this guilty feeling, like I was doing something wrong. My friend even commented on how flirtatious this guy had been, and jokingly offered to give him my number - I shuddered. When my ex and I were dating, his friends would text him if I so much as spoke to a male bartender in their presence, and my ex would continually remind me how fucked up it would be if I cheated on him (no disrespect, but that’s not my thing). 

Today I hung out with a male friend my ex was always jealous of. We had lots of fun, but it was weird, he kept making comments like ‘imagine if we were dating’ or speculating whether passersby thought we were a couple. He’s really nice, but I just don’t like him that way (I wish I did, it would be so easy, my family really like him and he fits right in). I felt guilty every time he touched me or looked at me for too long, or even when he was saying goodbye with a lingering hug. 

Anyway, I don’t fall easy, but I was definitely head over heels for my ex (at least when he was a nice, decent person). I’m scared that I won’t be able to overcome these feelings of guilt in the future if I were to meet someone new. My friends and family helped me see how inappropriate and wrong the way he treated me was, so why can’t I let go of these feelings? 

Any advice would be much appreciated. I’m perfectly happy being single, I’m just concerned this may impact me if I get into another relationship (although I don’t even know about that one, maybe I’m better off by myself, so no rush).",2019-07-07 15:08:27,2,11,relationship_advice

However, I cannot bring up a single issue to my BF (not even a simple talk) without this coming up. I feel so trapped because there are some things I am very unhappy about, but he won’t hear them until I get my license. 

I’d like to add: my job calls for public transportation, I never ask for rides, I’m willing to take the busses, if we go out to something with alcohol I offer to buy a cab there and back so he can let loose as much as he likes.

Brian didn’t respond so I assumed I would just hit him up if I was free, and if he happened to still be free we would hang out. 

I spent the day at the expo and my other friends invited to an afterevent. It was an exclusive VIP event so I was really excited to go. One mistake on my part: I completely wasn’t paying attention to my phone and it died around 3pm. So I get home around 3am and charged my phone and it turns on to texts from Brian asking if I’m at the convention and when I’d be home. I immediately responded and this is how the conversation went:

&gt;	Me: Hey man I’m really sorry I got caught up with the convention and didn’t have my phone until now.

&gt;	Brian: Whatever. Hope you had a good time. 

&gt;	Me: Thanks. How was your night? I really apologize if I messed up any plans for you. I didn’t think we had finalized anything. 

&gt;	Brian: The night went awfully for me because of you. Have a good week. 

Am I wrong in thinking this is an overreaction? 
I’ve been close friends with Brian for 5 years now and we hang out sporadically.

27,c9syh0,drobthrowaway,UPDATE: My (M21) parents (M/F 50s) think I need therapy because I enjoyed my summer vacation. PLEASE HELP ME.,"I didn’t think that I would update this but I’d just give a little something.

My mother came into my bedroom and we sat down and talked. She said that she was now mad at my dad for saying that he “wasn’t in my corner” most of my life. This is 100 percent true. I truly think my dad doesn’t understand other people’s perspectives. 

With his career, there’s a three month stretch that he has to work over 100 hours a week. Hard to believe but it’s true. He thinks that if you’re not busy, you should be working. Which brings me to my previous problem about my summer vacation. 

He thought that there was something wrong with me because I wasn’t working. I was just so burned out from work/school that I decided to take a break for the summer. I go to college 1300 miles from my hometown so he never saw me struggle trying to juggle school and work (it paid off, just found out I made deans list for the second time). And I knew that once I headed back to school, the cycle would continue.

My mother told me that he’s been making snide remarks this whole summer about me not working. And my mother was the only whole that kept him for forcing me to work. It made me realize that I was a dumbass for yelling at my mom today. We have our own problems but she is seriously my rock. This has nothing to do with anything but if my parents ever got divorced when I was younger, I would’ve wanted to stay with my mom permanently.

She’s the one who taught me to hit a jump shot and how to throw a curveball. She took me to all my AAU basketball tournaments from age 13 to 18. My dad was never been there for those moments because he’s always been working. I think I may have grown to resent him a little for always working. 

I think I started to truly hate him last winter when I came home for Christmas break. The previous semester was when I started my full time job. It was a little hard for me to balance time but the second semester of my sophomore year was a lot better. I told him that I got 3 B’s, 1 A and a C for my grades. He made a comment that still sticks to me today. He said “well you better get deans list next semester so you’ll save me money.” My mom and I both laughed because we thought he was joking. He wasn’t. It started another argument where my mom defended me.

From that moment on, I’ve secretly hated him. And the events of yesterday was the icing on the cake. I told him straight up that I hate him. And his response? He said “well you’re entitled to your own opinion. Just remember how much I do for you.” I was seething with anger but just decided that it wasn’t worth my time.

I slept till around 11 pm and grab some food as I didn’t eat the whole day. My mom was sleeping on the couch, mostly because she was still mad about what he said to me.

So ya that’s basically it. I made up with my mom but I told my dad that I hate him.

Thank you to all the people who told me about the benefits of therapy. It truly changed my opinion. I haven’t told either of them yet but I’m gonna say that I’ll only go to therapy if my dad goes as well. It can be him and I together or both of us separate. I just wanna know why he thinks there’s something wrong with me.

I don’t know if there will be another update. There’s really nothing else to say at this point. Thanks everyone for the help.

This subreddit became a pseudo hobby for me for the past month. I kinda like giving my opinion when others ask for help about their relationships and the dialogue people have together as a community. I’m just glad that people were here to help me out when I needed it. 

Thanks.

EDIT: I see a lot of people talking about how my parents are paying for my college. It’s only about half true. My tuition comes out to about $43k a year. My parents have agreed to pay $20k of it since my sister dropped out of college (they used to pay $10k). I’ve accumulated around $7k in scholarships from my college as well. The rest is coming from loans that I’m taking. So if we’re counting, I pay for $16k of my college a year.",2019-07-06 12:15:30,191,1469,relationship_advice
28,ca84xr,applecher,Should I feel jealous with someone gay who is flirting with my BF?,"Hi everyone!

This post may be long. This thing has been bugging me for weeks and I'm going crazy thinking about it.

My BF (33M) was assigned to train an incoming manager (25M), who is gay, few months ago. After several weeks, my BF is now assigned to report to JD. Long story short, they became friends. We go on lunch together, they (BF and JD) have breaks together, they go out and drink with other colleagues, JD even slept in my BF's place twice. 

Since then, I have noticed that JD is becoming too close to my BF. I think he is already crossing the line and is starting to flirt with my BF. Below are the reasons: 
- As his manager, they have closed-door meetings that are so long to the point that my BF has to go OT to do the more important stuff. 
- At one point, he got angry at my BF because BF asked help from another manager. JD wasn't there at that time and BF needs the opinion of someone higher. 
- When my BF's team goes overtime, JD stays. But if his other teams go overtime, he doesn't care and he goes home on time.
- When they go out as a group, he only pays for my BF.
- Once, JD told BF that he's annoyed at him for no reason.
- JD is quiet and annoyed whenever I'm around my BF but bubbly and smiling when I'm not. 

I told my BF the same reasons listed above and told him I am jealous. He just laughed it off. For the record, he is straight. He is not interested with any guys. I have nothing against the LGBTQ people. I have a lot of gay friends and I don't see them as boys, I see them as girls. So right now, I don't know if me feeling jealous is wrong, or if I should be threatened. I am threatened, yes. Every time I see JD ""finding ways"" to spend time with BF disguised as work, I get annoyed. I am annoyed! I am annoyed also that my BF doesn't seem to understand where I am coming from. Is it because my reasons are invalid? I don't know what to do.",2019-07-07 15:38:43,14,8,relationship_advice
29,ca9a5n,throwaway768789,My boyfriend's sister (26F) sends him highly inappropriate sexy pics of her and her friends.,"I posted this earlier in /relationships but it was removed for being a shitpost, trolled by users etc so please just click away if you have no desire to help. tl;dr at bottom.


My boyfriend’s sister sent him a nearly nude full frontal pic of her best friend Anna. She KNOWS he’s in a relationship with me.

Leading up to this, she gave his number to Anna because Anna wanted to grab drinks with him. My boyfriend mentioned it to me I had a bad feeling, she recently broke up with her bf &amp; out of the blue wants to go out with mine? Told him how I felt &amp; he said I was overreacting but grudgingly agreed to turn it down. Then, his sister sends him these bikini pics of Anna. It's like she's enticing him.

Turns out, she sends him inappropriate body shots and sexy pics of her friends and HERSELF often. He said “I’ve told her to stop but she sends them anyway.”

He knows her hookup stories, how many guys she’s been with, he once told me she asked him what his favorite sex position is. I thought it was weird, but he was open &amp; honest so I brushed it off as weird sibling stuff, but now combined with the pictures I can't brush it off, I’m freaked out. 

I don't have any siblings, but this seems like crossing a HUGE line.

When I brought it up, he said “yeah and I’ve told her to stop a million times. I can’t control what she says, I’ve told her to shut up. “If it were you, I'd hope you’d do everything to stop and prevent it, but you can’t control other people’s actions (something about locus of control)” 

I started yelling how I can’t just *accept* that my boyfriend’s relationship with his sister includes sexy pics and sexual comments. It’s gross, and his family needs therapy. He got extremely defensive, lashed out, eventually said “this is weird can we stop talking about this, you're taking it too far. She sends me inappropriate pics, she never asked me what my fav position is”

He‘s now denying that last bit. Plus he’s saying he can’t stop her from sending sexy pics ""I know its inappropriate and I've told her to stop many times but she hasn't I'm telling you there’s no point it’s not worth the effort”

I can't tell him to stop talking to her it's his sister, but every time he's with her or texting her, I'm so uncomfortable. I had no way of finding out so he could've just hidden it, but he was open &amp; honest so I do want to have a discussion again in case it's truly not his fault. However, he's extremely defensive about his family and sister so I have to tread lightly.

Is this normal? How do I best have this discussion, especially now that he's saying he can't do anything about the sexy pictures she sends and has backtracked on her asking him what is fav sex position is. What do I do? 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr My boyfriend's sister sends him sexy pictures of her and her friends. She knows he's dating me. My boyfriend says he can't do anything about it and is extremely defensive.",2019-07-07 17:20:29,9,6,relationship_advice
30,ca7edf,Imnotjanlevinson,[27f] my boyfriend's [33m] jokes are starting to cause a strain in our relationship.,"This is a throwaway 

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years, we've lived together about 2 years. We've had our ups and downs, but always manage to work through them together, and it has made our relationship stronger. As of late though, some of his personality traits are becoming a problem. Everything he says, has to be a joke. Every response has to include some type of stupid joke or pun. 

The other day I was bringing something up to him, not something very important, but just starting a conversation and stating how I felt about something, and his only response was a joke about how I phrased something I said. I told him he completely disregarded what I said, and then he defended his joke and still didn't acknowledge that I has trying to have a conversation with him. I gave up and the conversation ended. 

He also has a very childish way about anything involving sex or sexual advances. I have compared him to how Michael Scott acts about sex or anything related, but he's seems to have forgotten that conversation and continues to act how he always does. He has a very tough time talking about sex, or how to improve our sex life. So maybe he feels he has to take away the seriousness in order to handle it? 

He rarely ever initiates sex (which is another thing we've had many conversations about, and he is trying, though not very hard), and when he does, it's in such an annoying way (he'll fake moan as he grabs my ass as I get off the couch, or other things of the like) that sex becomes the last thing I want. He doesn't know how to subtly start making a move. It's always way overdone and does everything but turn me on.

I used to be the sole initiator, but now even I find myself not wanting to. I don't know how to address these issue with him without him getting upset and blowing up. His joking mannerisms were cute on the first date when we were both nervous and he was just trying to lighten the mood to ease the tension, but I don't ever find him funny. None of the jokes he makes are for me, he makes them because he thinks everything he says is funny, and I think he gets some kind of satisfaction from it. Which has to be the case because I never laugh at them. All I ever do is roll my eyes anymore. I try to tell myself he has good intentions, or it's just how he is. But it doesn't last long and I find myself annoyed by him 2 minutes later. I don't care that he's not funny, I just want to be able to have normal conversations with my boyfriend without him ruining them with his jokes. I just want him to act like an adult towards sex. Maybe I can't get this with him. 

How can I talk to him about this without hurting him? Or is this just who he is and I either accept it or move on?",2019-07-07 14:29:07,8,11,relationship_advice

Me and my girlfriend have been together for a bit over 2 years. We are currently (still) living together as well.  
This night, she wanted to have a girls-night out with her friends. I have to admit, I was a bit worried, but of course didn't tell her she couldn't go. We both have had some trust issues in the past, and does affect little still, but all aside, she went out without me complaining one bit.  


She went out to a club with 2 of her friends, which both in my eyes are the types to be hanging around guys a lot. so at some point they both found some guys, upon which i got some replies to a message i send my girlfriend since she was alone for the moment. At that moment I got a bit more worried.  
Truth be told, over the last couple of weeks/months we had some fights and heavy discussion. On top of that, no sex. Not because we were angry or anything, but we just haven't done anything in quite some time, and that fact added to my worries unfortunately.  


But, all well still. she's out, having fun, all fine. She was supposed to spend the night at one of the 2 friends' place. like a sleepover with the three of them. However, one of them found a guy and decided that they would take the apartment for themselves. So i got a message from my girlfriend she'd be staying somewhere else. Now, the weird thing is, it's 30mins to get home to our place, same amount of time to the place she mentioned to go. I found this so extremely weird, that I called, to ask whose place would you even be staying at? since it made more sense to come home.  
''My friend met this guy at the club, and there's some other guys too, and we will go to his place, I can sleep there.''  


At this moment I got quite furious and confused, because she wants to sleep at a guy's place, and they met the guy at the club. As well as it's way easier to come home to sleep here? Her reasoning: she didn't want her other friend to go there alone. While it's pretty clear to me that her friend just wanted to f\*ck this guy.  


This became a huge issue. I feel she completely betrayed my trust, and I think it's pretty logical that I'm not okay with her sleeping at a guy's place who they met at a club while it's easier to come home to sleep. I'm just wondering whether I was being an asshole, but also I am just not sure whether to trust her anymore if she really thinks that her idea was completely okay. I am feeling like this could lead to a fight that will end our relationship.  


My apologies if I left something out or if it's unclear, as mentioned, it's 6am, I am alone at home, confused, angry and sad.",2019-07-07 03:01:28,121,82,relationship_advice
32,ca9jgr,OrangeOozy,My wife (28F) wants to leave me (30M) after our first year of marriage,"I'm about 30 years old. I've been with my  wife now for over 8 years, married just a little over 1. She's been my best friend for so long, but lately she's been realizing she wants to be alone more, as in, not being with me. The whole time we have been together we have talked about growing old together, watching the couples at wedding dwindle down to the last two, and said confidently one day that will be us. She wanted 5 children, I talked her down to 2 . She lost her mother last year which is the last living direct family member she had left, and it was really hard on her, and still is, and has changed her. She doesn't see a point in having children any more, told me that everybody just dies alone anyways, and thinks the planet is turning into a flaming ball of garbage, which is true. She now says she doesn't want to have children and doesn't think it's worth giving up her whole life to have them, I'm reminded of Jennifer Barkley from Parks and Rec, ""I'm just gonna go spend my time doing exactly what I wanna do -- because I don't have children!"".. we used to always laugh at that.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems really sudden to me, but to her she tells me that there's been a lot of red flags along the way. I haven't been in a lot of relationships, I thought these fights and issues were normal things. She tells me, ""Even if that is what normal relationships are why would we want that?"" good question, I just was looking for a partner to help raise a family. Now that when I bring that up, that upsets her, and told me ""I am more than just a vessel for human life"".. right I understand, but I've been under this impression that this what we both wanted in life, so I've always seen her as the mother of my future children.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot of issues myself. I'm childish, I'm passive aggressive, I have anger issues. Our sex life has been bad lately too.. I had a couple drinks when we were on our anniversary and she was already starting to feel distant from me, and I was unable to perform in the moment, which happens sometimes when I drink (circulation issues) / she wasn't that into it at the moment.. I put a lot of weight on me for this. I know sex is important to relationships, and with us having a bad sex life I ask myself if it's my fault for her no longer being attracted to me. She told me she used to feel safe in my arms, but it's been so long.. I've had no alcohol when she's around because I want to prove to her I can still be a man in her life, but I know it's not going to happen. I feel like we would need couples therapy and have a therapist say ""go have sex"" in order for her to have sex with me. I don't want her to have sex with me like, I'm a man, I'm trying to get some, I'm trying to release some hormones and chemicals that she used to feel, and want to be with me again, see me the way she used to.. but that's for another day I guess..

&amp;#x200B;

Back to my other issues. My anger. I'm easily set off. She told me she feels like she's stepping on egg shells when she's around me. I looked into an anger management book, a couple actually, and one of them mentioned being married for 10 years, and his wife told him the exact same thing... where the issues he saw were just little things, and the issues she saw were making her feel uneasy, stepping on eggshells, and was willing to leave him over it. I've wanted to work on my anger for a long time, this has really forced me to take drastic measures on controlling my temper, because I will do literally anything to make this work -- which she says is stupid, that I shouldn't change, we should just be our own separate people because we are unpalatable (which to me this word blows my mind.. I've said before ""I'm very fortunate that I found a person who can put up with all my shiz"", but I guess I was wrong). For my own sake, I want to work on my anger, even if I'm with her or not, why would I want to curse and swear at nothing when I can't find something I need that's going to make me late for work?

&amp;#x200B;

She's going to probably move out as soon as she's able to. I don't know if she still wants to stay married. She says she wants to try some things, she says she still loves me, but I just don't even know. She's on vacation right now taking a week away to think about things and do some of her hobbies. I'm trying to give her some space because she doesn't  really enjoy me right now. I want to talk about things but I can't talk to her about them. I've already harassed a couple of my friends about things, but also don't want to bring them down with all my stuff.. so I came to Reddit. I need people to talk to, I need help, I need advice.

&amp;#x200B;

She told me that she was insulted that I saw her as ""the only person I wanted to have my children with"".. maybe that was out of frustration, like, am I supposed to think about impregnating other women while being married? If so, my bad.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the worst most surreal thing of my life, people tell me it will be okay. I want to be extreme and move away and find new things.. that's dumb. I've compared every woman I've ever met to my wife and I always put her ahead of everyone. She's my favorite person, I want to only be with her. I'm not being stubborn, I've thought A LOT about it, for years. We were engaged like two years, I had so much time to think about everything.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a giant wall of text, there's a lot of stupid stuff in here, I'll take literally any advice from anybody that wants to talk to me about this. I'm so tired of waking up in this empty bed with her gone and fearing this is the rest of my life forever.

&amp;#x200B;

I've heard the first two years of marriage are the hardest. I figured they were gonna be fine, made it  through one, but here we are on the second. I hope to get through it. I'd also like to add that she told me that she just wants to be alone, live alone, a thing she's never done before. I was paranoid about there being someone else, she tells me there's not. I have to trust her. I feel her wanting to just be alone is much better than trying to be with someone else, it gives me hope instead of already losing.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if you don't respond, and read this all the way to the very end, I greatly thank you for your time.

&amp;#x200B;

..Unless you are my wife, and I'm really sorry that I made a post on Reddit.. I don't think you subscribe to this subreddit though. She would read some of the things I said as attacks on her, as that's how she's been viewing my interactions with her.. everything to her is an attack right now. I'm not trying to attack anyone over here, I'm just looking for help. Thank you.",2019-07-07 17:42:01,7,5,relationship_advice
33,ca9fet,squish1976,My boyfriend (26M) wont even talk to me (26F) about our future together.,"We met in our first year of university in 2010 and started a relationship in 2011. Since then we've both graduated university (2015). He decided he hated his degree and wanted to go back to college. I put my plans on hold and lived at home until he was done. Our city is very expensive for rent and I couldnt afford to live on my own. During that time, anytime I brought up moving out on our own, he would shut it down. He wouldnt even entertain a conversation about the future, he would just say he couldnt afford it at the moment and that was it.

Finally he finished his education, got a great job and we moved in together in July 2018. I gave him some space because he was going through a ton of changes...just graduating, new job, new home. After Christmas I started talking about the next step and he shut me down again. So I made myself a promise. In July of 2019 i will talk to him about our future.

He shut me down...again. he says he doesn't want to slow down but wont explain what he means by that. He doesnt want to do anything like travel or climb mountains or go to another country to find himself so I'm not sure what that means.

FINALLY I got it out of him. He wants to be open to careers but feels having a wife would tie him down to one spot. I feel the opposite. Having a husband means I'm tired to him. To me, without any committment, why should I uproot my life, my career, my family and friends to follow my boyfriend for whatever career he wants.

All of our friends are getting engaged. His younger brother (24) is getting married in October. My older sister (29) is eloping sometime this year.

How can I talk to him about our future? I'm not saying he has to go buy me a ring and propose the next day, I just want some sort of assurance that we have a future together.",2019-07-07 17:32:56,3,5,relationship_advice
34,caa5jh,honkmyvanhorn,I (23/f) don't want my dad (43/m) walking me down the aisle on my wedding.,"Hey everyone. Long post, sorry in advance. I do not want my emotionally abusive dad to walk me down the aisle on my wedding day. Im having my younger brother (22/m) doing it instead. The problem im having is that i have no idea how to tell my dad that i dont want him to do it in fear that he'll cause a scene. 
Heres some background as to why i dont want my dad walking me down the aisle,
1) he constantly lied about my mom when we were growing up. At the age of 4, he started telling me that my mom was stealing his money (child support.. My dad only saw us 4 days out of the month) and that my mom cheated on him when we were little. Hes telling me this when i was 4. I had no idea what cheating even was. 
2) when my brother was 9, he would go fishing with my dad constantly. My dad would get drunk on these fishing trips and make my brother drive him home. He also got my brother addicted to chewing tobacco at this age. 
3) I just had my son two months ago but while pregnant with him, I had terrible back issues to the point where it was painful to stand. Because of this, I didnt go to many family functions. During Christmas, I told my grandma I couldn't make it and she said that was ok. My dad texted me and told me im a piece of shit and that he wants a paternity test because im not his real daughter. 
4) When i had my son, i invited my grandparents to visit me in the hospital. Not my dad. But guess who showed up!! He apologized to me for the paternity test statement and i forgave him because i wanted to move on from it and not think about it anymore. Well a month later my dad starts shit talking me again to my grandparents saying that im keeping his grandchild away from him even though he has not asked once to see him. 
Those are the biggest emotionally abusive/messed up things he has done. Other things include calling me a ungrateful bitch everyday i saw him, punching holes in the wall if i didnt do his dishes, saying im constantly going to hell if i didnt go to church, etc. 
I need some advice on how to tell my dad that i do not want him to walk me down the aisle because honestly, i dont even consider him a father. I consider my brother to be the most prominent male figure throughout my life. Im just nervous that he will try and turn my family against me or will come to my wedding and cause a huge scene.",2019-07-07 18:32:44,5,4,relationship_advice
35,ca96s5,Rayquaz4,For those of you who survived infidelity in a relationship (were cheated on) - what steps did you personally take to move through this and come out better?,"So I’ve wracked my brain about this situation and I’ve come to the following conclusions:

1. There’s no excuse for my partner cheating on me

2. BUT - while there is no excuse - I find myself looking over my relationship and realize that my partner tried (in many ways) to get me to listen to him about the problems he was facing, but I didn’t. (We never had a conversation where we just sat down and talked about it - though - so that could be why I wasn’t understanding).  I’ve decided to forgive him and move forward with him.

Anyways, my question to you all is - what did you do as the cheatee to help the relationship on your end? What do you think I should do? What do you think needs to change in this relationship on my end, his end, or both ends? 

Also - please feel free to ask clarifying questions! I really do want well-rounded advice so I don’t mind getting into it. 👍

(P.S. I do go to a therapist once a month - since that’s as much as I can afford - so that’s already in motion)",2019-07-07 17:12:28,5,6,relationship_advice
36,ca9zzn,throwaway2048932,Concerned my (f/30) my extreme cosmetic surgery will be a deal breaker for most men.,"I have a problem with being vulnerable. I tend to keep most things that happened to me in the past and never bring them up. However, I know that cosmetic surgery to most men is a deal breaker. I'm sure they'd appreciate if I was honest with them.

After I had braces, my jaw expanded to make room for my teeth that were aligned. My muscles in my jaw (masseter muscle) also started to protrude after I had braces. Doctors really didn't know why. I began to look extremely masculine over a period of a couple years. I was self-conscious about this.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up getting jaw reduction surgery. However, it's such an extreme surgery and I know most would find this off-putting. The thing is that in comparing childhood and teenage (before braces) pictures to now you would never tell I had surgery. I also don't look superficial in the face at all after surgery. I look like an average Jane.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be open with all my partners and even friendships but I feel this is a deal breaker for a lot of people. I'm sure many would fine this to be very vain. I'm not a vain person but I like to also look the gender that I identify with and also my biological sex that I am which is a woman. How can I go about this?

&amp;#x200B;

37,ca9z5m,LadyBeemer,Boyfriend’s (19M) brothers (older 20’s) think he’s whipped and says it to him and I feel hurt and not respected by them or my boyfriend bc i feel he doesn’t stick up for me,"I’m (20F) in a long distance relationship (1 1/2 year) with my boyfriend. He works nights while I’m at home from college. My boyfriend and I have always had our fair share of typical LDR problems like communication and all and I like to think we’ve been getting better at it. I also like to think I’m getting better at understanding space and boundaries and respecting my boyfriend’s time to do his thing - something I had an issue with at the beginning of our relationship. Now, I always encourage him to go out and do his daily activities like rock climb, running, playing games with his brothers, sleep before work, etc. bc I’m usually doing chores, watching my shows, helping my mom with dinner, cleaning the kitchen, showering, etc and then I have him for about 1-2 hours before he goes to work and I go to bed.  In that hour I have him, I feel anxious to talk about him with everything because I really feel that’s all the time I have with him on the days he works.

However, being 4th of July and all, he had a 4 day weekend off from work. I was excited about this bc this meant I could actually spend quality time with him (rabb.it and date night which is rare), but I remembered I was going to be with my friends for the 4th and 5th. I let him know and I suggested he could use this time to play games with his brothers since he hasn’t in so long. I was really excited for him to have this time with them because I know he doesn’t talk to them much with his job and all. I haven’t really met his brothers or developed a personal relationship with them since they both live in different cities/states. I’m a very anxious and shy girl and I have issues with social anxiety, and I don’t really know what they think of me... 

What’s been bothering me is that whenever my boyfriend and I would make plans to do date night, his brothers would also ask him to play games that same day. If he mentions he’s spending time with me (according to my boyfriend) they would say stuff like, “wowww can’t spend time with your brothers” or “you’re whipped” and honestly that really hurts me.. He told me it’s hard for him to talk to his brothers about our time because they won’t understand. It’s been hard on him bc he feels like he has to choose between me and his brothers. To avoid feeling like that, he’ll just tell them that he wants to take an intermission on gaming and that’s when he’ll talk to me and do date night. When they message him later that night to get on, he’ll just say he’s too tired and then resume date night.. 

This has been happening for awhile but more recently because I found out that they’ve been saying he’s whipped.. I really don’t like that term because it makes me feel his brothers don’t respect me or understand that I, too don’t get as much time with him either, that I’m not some girlfriend that keeps him away from his friends or his time with his brothers. My boyfriend and I agree on date night ahead of time and knowing they say this to him makes me feel like crying. According to my boyfriend  he either just shrugs it off and says, “oh we’re just madly in love” or “yeah whatever” in a joking way. I don’t know for sure if they are serious or just saying it in a joking way, but I feel like my boyfriend hasn’t been sticking up for me when he gives these lax responses. I want him to tell them, “hey, I haven’t talked to my girlfriend for 2 days, I really want to spend time with her” or “I promised my girlfriend this night for her” something like that. His brothers don’t know that I always encourage my boyfriend to play games or cheer him on to go to rock climbing when he’s lazy and wants to stay in bed..  I feel they also don’t understand LDR because they both have their SO’s right there with them. 

I cried last night when I learned of this and my boyfriend reassured me that he’s not whipped and all that, but then he did a 180 after talking more, and he does actually feel a bit whipped, and I don’t understand how. It makes me upset he lied to me and gave me a false notion in the first place. Emotions were high and we just decided to cool off to talk about it today. I don’t know if he knows the exact meaning because he related it to always having to ask me to play games, but here’s the thing. I always tell him that he doesn’t need to “ask” me for permission, but I would instead like to know ahead of time so I can plan my time accordingly. This was one of the issues we had about LDR. I never told him he has to ask for permission and always chide him for asking me, sometimes he’ll lovingly respond, “I know I just want your input” and I appreciate that sentiment, but now it’s like, “I feel like I always have to ask for permission or plan my whole day around you” when it’s not like that at all. He doesn’t understand the difference of controlling communication versus “hey baby I’m going to be playing games later tonight” because he’ll always phrase it as, “is it okay if I play games later tonight” and it frustrated me he couldn’t see the difference when we talked about it last night. I expressed that I should be able to have a night with him after he played 2 nights with his brothers he’ll say, “you don’t game baby, it’s not gaming for 4 hours and saying that’s enough, it’s gaming that night and then hoping to game the next night with them too” but it’s like, well, where does time with your girlfriend play into this? Is my time with you not as pertinent as time with your brothers? I’m not asking him to stop playing with his brothers, I just want him to understand that my time with him is just as important as time with his brothers. And when he doesn’t stick up for me or say things like that, it makes me feel below his brothers...

Looking up the definition of whipped this morning made me sick. Knowing this is how his brothers view me and how he can’t stick up for me in the sense of telling them he barely has time with me too really makes me feel angry and sad, but mostly really anxious because his brothers view me that way... my boyfriend and I plan to talk about it later today, but I’m really anxious and would love some pointers to bring up or anything at all really. I would appreciate any input - I’m willing to answer any questions you may have bc I know this is a bit everywhere and I apologize. I just want advice on how to approach this with him and make him understand that him not sticking up for me and giving vague responses hurts me. I also want him to understand that him not talking to his brothers about this also makes me frustrated.",2019-07-07 18:17:52,1,4,relationship_advice

For the record, the engagement talk isn't the only reason I wan't to split - it's just an indicator of how serious he's got. 

I don't think we are a great match anyway, we have very different personalities, and want very different things in the future. When we are together, he is very clingy. He tries to kiss passionately at every available opportunity. This makes me pretty uncomfortable. I'm just not attracted to him anymore. We had a good friendship before, but since we began dating, he's been telling me things like, 'you looked at me \*this time\*, and it lasted just slightly too long, that's how I knew you liked me...' Every part of our relationship has changed overnight, and it just feels really wrong. We used to be such great friends, but now its really weird and uncomfotable.

We have only had two dates so far and he is moving so quickly, I feel like I've made a huge mistake in getting with him in the first place.

39,c9zlv1,ThrowAway4728473847,My (27M) boyfriend screamed and broke things because I (25F) got upset about his behavior in a store.,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I apologize for length as I just want to include as many details as possible.

I am posting this because I need validation and for someone to tell me that I am not crazy.


I had recently gotten paid, so I had the money to get some fishing equipment that I have been wanting to buy for a few months now. I have been talking about purchasing these things a lot, so my boyfriend knows my level of excitement about getting into this hobby.


We planned on going to a sports store today to get the things that I wanted to buy. On the way there, I told him that I planned on staying in the store for awhile. This was mostly a heads-up because he’s the type of guy who likes to get in and get out, while I like to browse. He agreed that he would give me the time I needed to look around.


As soon as we got into the store, he immediately complained that I had gotten a cart instead of opting to simply carry the things I needed. I guess grabbing a cart really communicated to him that I was going to be looking around for awhile. Obviously, this upset me as I had given him a heads-up.


He went looking around on his own for awhile (15 minutes) while I did my thing. I had found some things I wanted to get and was excited to show him. While he was walking with me he would not stop sighing, complaining, and acting annoyed every time I would walk in a direction to look at something. I again reminded him that I told him I would be here for awhile and tried to maintain my level of excitement and good mood. And yet, it continued. So naturally, by the end of the shopping trip I was upset that I was getting this kind of a reaction from him when I am simply trying to enjoy the things I am buying.


He tried talking to me while we were checking out, but I was quiet and he knew immediately that I was upset.


He immediately went from 0-100. As soon as we got into the car, he was screaming and yelling and wanting to know why the hell I was acting this way. I told him that I was trying to be excited about starting a new hobby and that his constant complaining every time I turned around ruined the shopping trip for me. He jerked the keys from my hand and told me that I was not allowed to drive and leave. The yelling continued and mostly remained quiet as I understood that anything I said would only fuel his anger. He held the keys to my face and told me that I needed to start driving immediately or he would throw the keys at me. 


The entire time while driving he stared at me with the most hatred look in his eyes. I just tried to focus on driving. The yelling eventually continued. He said things along the lines of “if I enjoy shopping this much that I should go out and find someone who will react the way I want them to.” 

Throughout this entire ordeal he would constantly yell “ARE YOU SERIOUS? ARE YOU ACTUALLY UPSET?” as if he was challenging me in some way.

Right before we got home, he grabbed a stick (cactus skeleton on the dashboard of the car-it was a gift from a friend) and violently smashed it against the windshield until it shattered. I told him he was scaring me and he screamed at me to shut up and that “I bring this behavior out in him.”


As soon as we got home I grabbed my things and ran for the apartment building. He got in the car and left.


I honestly don’t know what to do. It has been a few hours now and I am just sitting in my apartment, afraid of what will happen when he comes home if he even comes home.


I just feel crazy and his behavior makes me question if this is all of my fault. What should I do?",2019-07-06 22:32:24,105,141,relationship_advice
40,ca3why,cars54321,Girlfriend is hanging out with guy I dislike despite me letting her know I’m uncomfortable with that,"So there is quite a bit of backstory to this scenario, I have a few reasons to dislike this guy.

So let’s call this guy John. My girlfriend and I had been together for about 2 years before John came into our lives. John has actually always been a family friend of my girlfriends, but he was never at functions and therefore never mentioned by my girlfriend. As of last year however, he has actually started attending those functions more frequently and henceforth has gotten to talk to my girlfriend more. 

At some point during last summer, he asked my girlfriend to go see a movie with him, and she said sure. She is of course free to hang out with whomever she chooses and she let me know beforehand what was happening so it wasn’t like she was doing this behind my back. However, I was under the assumption that she had let him know she had a boyfriend. I later went on to discover that she had not let him know. 

I discovered this when she sent me a screenshot of John asking if she had a boyfriend because he was interested in her romantically. I appreciated this once again since I was being informed. I let her know that I wasn’t comfortable with her continuing hanging out with him due to his feelings for her and she decided to play the “you don’t trust me” card. That ended up becoming an argument which ended with me having to let her keep doing what she was doing which was texting and hanging out with him. 

They eventually went on a camping trip together later on which both their families organized together and a few other things. This of course meant we would have little contact with each other during her trip. This was all fine because I was caught up in life events and wouldn’t have had much time to talk to her either. So of course John and her got to know each other pretty well over this trip. 

Eventually a couple weeks later, I was still caught up in my life struggles and was trying my best to hang out with my girlfriend and give her as much attention I could. However, she always seemed distant and emotionless towards me during those times. She eventually sat down with me and told me that she wanted to take a break from our relationship because she felt like we were both being toxic towards each other. I agreed with this because I had recognized that ever since I got caught up in life, we had began to argue a lot more since we couldn’t really see each other as often or receive affection. So as she continues on about why she thinks we should do this, she also briefly mentions that she wants to keep hanging out with John without me getting jealous. Of course this intrigued me because every reason so far has been about us and then out of nowhere he is mentioned as a reason as well. 

So we end up taking a break and eventually she decides she made a mistake. We begin to talk and list off what our past mistakes were such as lack of communication and such. I eventually also bring up that I didn’t want her continuing to talk to John since he had been interested in her and she absolutely refuses to let him go. I asked why and she told me that it was because he gave her the attention I didn’t during those times I wasn’t able to really communicate. I was miserable in life at this point and really just wanted someone to love me and so I once again let it go and said it was ok to continue speaking and hanging out with John. 

However, a couple weeks after getting back together my girlfriend lets me know she is going to a friends birthday party. I think nothing of it and tell her to have fun. A couple days later, after she left her phone out and I looked through her text messages (yes I know, I shouldn’t have but something kept telling me to go through it) I came to find out that on the day she was supposedly at the party, she had actually been hanging out with John. She had sent him her address and he sent her a message letting her know he was outside. Keep in mind that this is all while he knows that she has a boyfriend and that she knows I don’t like him. I confront her about it and she go absolutely mad, telling me that they’re just friends and they just went out to eat, goes on about how she didn’t tell me because she knew I would be upset and how I don’t trust her. I didn’t want to argue so I let her know that if she did something like that behind my back again, I wouldn’t tolerate it. 

So eventually she starts letting me know again when they are going to hang out. They hung out a couple times afterwards such as the movies, Christmas shopping, and of course family functions. Again, all while he knows she had a boyfriend and she knows I don’t like him. 

Eventually however, she stops letting me know when they’re planning on hanging out and only lets me know once they are actually together. This bothers me and I let her know but she dismisses it. Once again stating that I don’t trust her. This all leads up to me building up anger and jealousy from the time when she stated he gave her the attention I didn’t. All this led up to yesterday when I told her I wanted to go bowling tonight. She had told me she had nothing going on and hence why I asked. However, once I brought up the bowling, she let me know that she was actually already going to go with John tonight. I asked her if I could join along and after a bit of arguing, she told me i couldn’t. 

So here I am now, stuck with a girlfriend who gets mad at me for disliking a guy who I have reasons to dislike, and her stating that I don’t trust her. I don’t know how to handle this issue any more, I have let her know it bothers me but she refuses to stop talking to him. I understand that it really isn’t possible with him being a family friend, but I still feel uncomfortable with it. I personally do not know John myself, that is an important note to state. At every family event I have been to with my girlfriend, he is either never there or leaves really early, almost as soon as I arrive. I can not communicate with him since I do not have any of his social media’s or phone number either. I am just lost as to what to do about this situation. Am I actually just not trusting my girlfriend? Or am I right to react and feel the way I do? What should I do to help me get over this situation? 

TL;DR
Girlfriend hangs out with guy that admitted he had feeling for her despite me being uncomfortable with that. She states its only a problem because I don’t trust her despite the fact that she broke up with me to hang out with him and because he gave her attention when I didn’t (There are more reasons but that was also one of them). She continues hanging out with him without letting me know until they are together. He knows she has a boyfriend and she knows I dislike him and am uncomfortable with them hanging out.

When I found out who he was and that he's still present in her life via social media, I suggested that it's best for us if she removed him or told him about us.

She refused to do both. A few weeks ago she told me he suggested they went out and she told me she declined to go out with him because she wants us to progress and stay together.

I want to trust her. I love this girl. But sometimes she makes me suspicious. Obv this person is causing us trouble by making me feel bad as he likes every picture of her and she's fine knowing that it hurts me, respectively our relationship.

Am I just being selfish or is she not respecting my  will and she's actually being selfish?

I'm giving so much into this relationship and sometimes I feel it's tilted unevenly. She was diagnosed with pneumonia and hospitalized for 8 days.

42,ca4i1y,survivormode,[31/f]My boyfriend(29/m) of almost 2 years is saying I raped him. Warning:very detailed.,"I have been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years, we have been living together for a year, found out we were pregnant in March and I’m 6 months pregnant now. 
This afternoon my boyfriend wanted to have sex, but I was tired because we were putting things away since we just moved to a new place.

 He had found some bed straps that I have bought to use with him for Valentines because he had told me he wanted to be strapped to a bed a long time ago. We ended up never using them. He convinced me to go the bedroom telling me we could use a break from organizing and take a little nap. While I was laying in bed he took the straps out of the box and showed them to me. I told him I was tired and they were meant to surprise him and for a special occasion. He said we could only try them out and I didn’t need to do anything and set them up in the bed. 
I agree to the trying thing, and then he got naked. I asked him why he had gotten naked and he said it was going to feel better. I strapped him, and then he asked me to”express my sexuality with him” I told him I didn’t need the straps to do that, but he begged me and I felt i wanted to please him, at then end we had a long week moving and things were good. I started pleasing him and after about 20 mins I took my clothes off and then 10 mins later I was on top of him, in the middle of everything he asked me to adjust the straps because he could still move a lot, which I did. 

We both finished and then, because it always happens after we have sex, I wanted another round, I kissed him and place himself inside me again, and then he said he didn’t wanted anymore so, I said “well, you never want a second round” and then he told me again he didn’t want it so, I jumped off him and took his hand straps off  first. 


He then started yelling at me saying that I had to respect him if he didn’t want to do something a stop right away and that I had done a very bad thing and I should be repenting. I told him I was sorry and I just did what I always do because it is what we do and that I hadn’t meant to either disrespect him or hurt him in any way, I apologized and told him I would never do it again. 


***Today after thinking clearly about what happened, I realized that he told me that now I had to let him do anal to me, that I had to because I had done something wrong to him. I told him that I wasn’t going to let him do it, which I have told him for a long time. We tried anal over a year ago and it hurt very much and I told him I never wanted to do it again. He has been trying to get me to do it since, and now more than ever with the baby, I don’t want to try anything like that, I don’t feel comfortable. ***

He kept yelling and saying I had gone against his words and needed to do better and recognized I had raped him. I said I didn’t think I had raped him that I had just put his penis inside me one more time and then stopped right away. I reminded him I didn’t even want to have sex, and didn’t want to try the straps and the whole thing was his idea. He yelled at me and told me I was laying and I did have raped him. I then started yelling at him, and he asked me to stop yelling because the neighbors could hear and call the police, I told him I was fine with them calling the police and it was better because then we could set things straight. He then left the apartment.

I’m afraid of the whole situation and left the place for the night. He’s a lawyer and I don’t know how far he could go with this. He tried to come and hug me many times and I told him to stop and pushed him away and ask him to stop touching or getting close to me. He called me a cunt and a liar then. 

I told him we were done and I don’t even want to touch him or have sex with him any more, he tried to say everything is my fault and I’m just a bad person and can’t recognize it. He said he was going to go and sleep with someone else, and asked me if I care, I told him I didn’t, and if he had those feelings and wanted to act on them it was his  decision not mine. I told him the apartment was big enough to live as roommates. He then changed his clothes and left as he was going out to dance. 

I don’t know what to do tomorrow. Did I really rape him? Should I just move out?  I can’t sleep thinking of all this things.",2019-07-07 08:03:27,28,21,relationship_advice

I told him my plan, I wanted to leave the house at 11am. We woke up a little late, 10am. At 1030 he was playing some PC game and I reminded him we have 30 min. He asked if I would drive, which I was fine with.

I then got into the shower, out, started getting dressed. We are at 15 min to departure and he starts complaining about feeling rushed.

Um, what? He asks for more time. I'm like, how much time? ""Idk, we just woke up and I dont want to feel rushed."" He cant give me a time he'll be ready because having a deadline makes him feel rushed. -_-

I remind him that we have plans at his parents house at 4pm and I want to make sure I get my things done.

He's going on about how I'm not budging at all like I'm terribly inconveniencing him. 

He's also begrudgingly going to his parents, he doesn't even want to! And the original plans were for just me anyway. 
He's including himself into my plans and then complaining and trying to get me to change my plans.

From what I can gather the sight is a sugarbaby/sugardaddy type of deal but obviously still this upsets me.  I can't see all her messages but she did send a message to someone as early as 2 says ago.  She doesn't know I've seen it yet and I don't know how to approach this.  She already talks to her ex a lot on Facebook and although she is innocent in these messages he is very clearly not and clearly wants her back.  I haven't spoke to her about either of these things yet and were due to go on vacation to Portugal in a week. I'm currently at her apartment and she'll be back in an hour and I  just need some advice on how to approach this situation / what to even say.

47,ca2kac,gmanuk93,I think my girlfriend is cheating my right now. What should I do?,"A little bit of context. My gf for almost 3 years, went to another city in my country  with their group to do a show. In this city lives her ex, who left her and then got a girlfriend. But they broke up recently. So the thing is that before she left she didn't close her Instagram account from my phone, and she also left her Whatsapp web in a shared PC.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday she upload a story to her ig and her ex replied to her (the story showed the a corner of the city so the ex knew she was there), and they set up to meet by 6pm today. I know that she is with him now(it's 12:38 am now), because in her wp their group asking where she is, she said that she was with a female friend of her that she hasn't seen in a long time. And she is not answering to me. I know this is bullshit because she doesnt have friends there.

&amp;#x200B;

So what should I do? Should I confront her now? Should I wait for her to come home on Wednesday? Should I give her a chance to see if she tell me that she saw her ex?

This is my very first post, so sorry if I do anything wrong. And sorry if I made any mistakes, English is not my first language

Update 1: Thank you for your comments, some things that you said I think like that but I needed to read it from someone else. What I will do is wait for her to come home and ask her something to tell me if she saw him or not, to see if she lies to me again (I think she will). I dont want to confront her now, because I dont want to affect the show they are doing (not because of her, but because of her group, I know them and I like them and I dont want to damage them). 

The only thing that bothers me is that I have to wait until Wednesday, and I dont know if I cant hold it until then.

Also, actually writting this down and hearing other people views calmed me down a little because I was panicking.

The break up is very fresh and mutual. I still care and love him, we’ve agreed to break up officially when I leave on a 2 week vacation.

52,ca6w9j,Prison-Bae,Should I wish my ex happy birthday?,"I know I’ll get many different opinions about how childish the topic is and our age difference but whatever I asked. And I know.

Me (21 F) and my ex (32 M) dated for on and off two years. It was ok but it lacked the effort I needed (I didn’t need much. Things like anniversary dates, birthday dates). But I accepted the daily phone calls and texts (we were mostly in different cities because of my university’s location). 

There are two sides to every story so I don’t want to get too into what his intentions might have been. I agreed to date him. I knew what I was doing, but the relationship was destined for failure. He told me he loved me but I think it was more that he has love for me. He never took me seriously as a priority. 

I think it was more about the sex than anything. We kept meeting up long after we broke up just for the sex but I ended it because feelings were starting to stir up again. There’s a lot more to the story after two years but those are the key points.

My dilemma is whether to wish him happy birthday in a couple days or keep my distance this year. The last phone call we had (a month ago) I hung up and cried for hours and we haven’t talked since. It was the “closure” phone call I think. 

Reaching out might make him think I’m still into him, plus he’s expecting it. He wished me happy birthday and I just don’t want to seem petty or bitter because I still care about him as a person. And he knows I still care. It’s hard not to have a soft spot for your first.

So.... I went to the party. It was mostly just the young people from our job (20-27). Jack and Laura were both there. I supplied edibles, and Jack brought beer and wine coolers. 

Like I said before, Laura and I are friends and I enjoy spending time with her.... but she is a lightweight. I guess I don’t really like drunk people when I’m not drunk (I had to leave the party early to go home) and they were all hammered, except for Jack. 

Fast forward to about 11:30.... one of our coworkers is falling down drunk, alternating between flirting with another drunk coworker and getting into bed; another coworker has puked and passed out. Jack, Laura (before she got drunk), and I cleaned him and the floor, and I put his shirt in the wash. We took turns watching him to make sure he threw up in a trash bag and didn’t choke on it. 

Jack and I were casually talking about the other coworkers. At this point, Jack is a little drunk from beer. I am not drunk but I’m coming down from a high, but I’m having fun because it’s a party. Jack and I were casually talking. I’m attracted to him and still high, so I was admittedly distracted by his looks and contemplating making a move on him.... until he casually dropped a racial slur into the conversation. 

I’m from the South, so the only times I hear words like that are in a very negative way. It made me uncomfortable and I told him, but he insisted he “only meant it in a good way”. I’m not a fighter, I let it go and changed the subject. Then Laura came in, sort of looking for his attention. She did a lot of things: she asked for a bottle opener, announced she had chugged a White Claw, asked for her phone, and even danced on Jack a little (she didn’t stop until she realized he’d been saying he was uncomfortable).

This happened a few separate times when Jack and I were alone. We’d be close *to something* (Ranging from sexual innuendo to almost kissing) until Laura found her way to us. Without fail, Jack would get called back to take care of the passed out one, and I’d get called to take care of the falling down drunk one. 

I’ve ultimately decided not to move forward with anything concerning Jack, one because of the racial slur and two because of how ambiguous he is towards me in every way. He hugged me, sat close enough that our bodies were touching, and even suggested that I have sex with someone in the house (I made an offhand comment that I was horny and I didn’t realize he’d heard it until after he replied). But on the other hand, he was too easily distracted by Laura and even our other coworkers. I’m already struggling with my own self esteem and even with my bad breakup (my ex partner never made me feel special or valued and didn’t pay attention to me unless he needed or wanted something. I want a change), and the fact that we can barely hold a conversation without him getting distracted is pretty discouraging to me, especially considering the fact that he mostly only did this with Laura. 

Sorry if this was disappointing to anyone, someone commented on the OP and reminded me that I’m young and that I have time to find someone to spend my life with. I don’t think it would be too smart to reveal my feelings to a person when I’m not sure how they feel about me too. Besides, I’ve been getting a lot of matches on tinder and bumble lately. Let’s just see if one of those goes anywhere.

Now the 28 year old lady is a bit of a slut and my girlfriend tells me about her cheating on her boyfriend all the time. My girlfriend insists that she HATES cheaters. Well... before she left for the trip she was telling me a story about how her slutty friend was telling her to ""bring your best swimsuit, the one your boyfriend doesnt know you have"" she said she replied something along the lines of ""Haha sure thing"" which, of course I know she could have just been saying to laugh it off, but still. Im not paranoid about her part in this section of the story. Just her friend. I dont think its unreasonable to say that I dont want my girlfriend hanging out with a slut in a different city yeah? Especially when I know they're gonna be drinking. Flash forward to the night that they're drinking. My girlfriend gets so blackout drunk that she loses her top. Not to mention she told me there was a guy in the hot tub that her and her coworker were talking to. See, I don't know and cant wrap my head around how you can just ""lose"" a top. Coupled with the fact that my girlfriend has a bad fucking habit of flashing people when she's drunk. Confronted her about it and it stopped, but fuck. I wasnt there. Basically, I dont know what the fuck happened that night. I called her at one point in the drinking night and she was barely coherent just stumbling around the halls. I talked her into going back to her room and she passed out but I have no idea where she really was before that and I have no idea at what point she lost her top. She doesnt either. So I dont know whether I can trust her. She said she didnt flash anybody and that she just took it off and threw it somewhere in the room, but wouldn't she be able to find it then?? Hotel rooms arent that big. She also said she might've taken it off in the room and then was carrying it around the halls and maybe just dropped it in the halls because she was drunk? I have no idea what to believe. My girlfriend has been sexually assaulted before and claims that she doesnt even like sex, but when we first started dating that's all she said she wanted. I even knew the guy she was about to fuck. Convinced her she deserves somebody who will respect her and treat her right and for the most part I have, but fuck I'm not perfect. I have faults too. We were fighting a good bit before her trip and honestly, I dont know what to think about this. For somebody who has been sexually assaulted, she sure does make a lot of jokes about sex. For instance, she's joked about fucking my brother before. This really worries me as my brother and I dont really have that great of a relationship. So now I dont know if I can trust her or him. Please help. I just what to know what an outsider would believe. You know, sometimes I think she's the worst and is so mean to me but then other times I think she's the sweetest. Sometimes it feels like she hates me but other times it's like I'm the greatest thing in the world. What do yall think?

She always has this knack of making me feel like a child. I cant do anything around her. She always baby talks as well. My brother is severely disabled and she speaks like this to him mostly, loudly as well even though no one else does and this has somehow wormed its way into her normal way of speaking. It not every word but instead of words like toilet she says wee wee and ikeweam for ice cream. It irritates me and she sees nothing wrong with it.

&amp;#x200B;

She also makes me do everything for her. If she wants her phone, she will make me get it. If she wants a check to be deposited or other banking stuff she will make me do it but instead of her detailed instructions on everything else she will just point me towards the bank and leave me. This is something she has done since I was 10, I have no idea what I am doing but if its not done she will get mad.

&amp;#x200B;

She always tells people my personal/ family business saying oh, we have nothing to hide. She has told people my financial stuff. Hangs up private documents of hospital appointments and the like up on a pinboard, as my brother is disabled we constantly have carers come into our home and they also use this pinboard for rotas and stuff for them. She has to record everything down in her calendar. If I go out somewhere or have something planned she needs it written down, even the time I am coming back. I never know when I am coming back because who the freak does?

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal or is it me just being weird. It is so irritating to have to deal with this. On top of this she calls me ungrateful and that she doesnt have to do anything for me as I am over 18. I paid for groceries that last two times because you had no money. I gave you $7000 a couple months ago as your business wasn't making enough. I do more then enough.

57,caa053,POZZOPIZZA,Should I [21F] tell my boyfriend [20M] that I've been cheating on him with another guy [24M]?,"Before you judge me, please hear me out..

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend and I have been together for 6 years. We've had our ups and downs like any normal couple. The only problem was that he never wanted me to get checked up by a psychiatrist. I've been going through depression for almost  8 years now. Not once he encouraged me to go. It got worse.  I had panic attacks, hallucinations and voices in my head. Whenever I would bring up the topic, he tells me to keep the money and not spend it on that. Use it for buying my games. The reason why I've stayed with him is because of how strong my feelings are for him. I don't want to leave him. I've tried to end it before, but I lost my courage and felt sorry when I saw him crying. I feel terrible for even thinking when to end it with him in the future because I don't really want to anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, it's the summer. We both have our jobs and rarely see each other. However, we still make time for that. Always. But again, whenever I bring up the topic that I desperately want to get checked up,  he insists that he will treat me. He feels that if I go, he won't feel important. The advice he keeps telling me is to just work hard and earn money for other things but not get the help I needed. The pressure is driving me crazy. Aside from that, we haven't even graduated college yet but he's already dreaming about having kids and getting married after we graduate. This made me realize that I don't even see myself growing old with him. He's been pressuring me with all of it. I'm just scared to end it.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago I met an incredible guy. We live apart so we never see each other. We only saw each other through video chats. He's been there for me as I've been there for him too. He also has troubles with his mental health. He was diagnosed with ADHD and Bipolar Disorder. We've connected and started to have feelings for each other..  We never stop talking to each other despite of the distance and the time zone.  He made me feel happy and special. He encouraged me a lot to go get checked out and been helping me out every step of the way. The same as I do for him.. We've been there for each other during the worst of times.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel terrible. I feel like an asshole. I don't know if I would admit to my boyfriend of what I've been doing. It's been haunting me and I kept getting worse because of this.  Should I also tell the other guy of what I've done? He's planning on seeing me next year.. Do I break up with my boyfriend? How? What do I tell him? How do I initiate breaking up?

58,ca9zno,girltgirlrheowaway,What should I do?,"I (16M) am in a bit of a weird spot. I met a girl (15F) 3 weeks back, at the beach we spoke a little. A few days after I found her Instagram, after sometime I added her on snap. 2 weeks back now, we've talked quite a lot. But I've come to the conclusion that I always initiate, she has sent me snaps first on two occasions. I've sent first every other time, when we're talking she usually doesn't reply with 1 word replies. It has only happened a handful of times. I asked her 4 days ago, if she wanted to hang out. She said ""I can't"", which I interpreted as that she doesn't have time. 

Some days ago jokingly asked her ""what's the most important thing in life for you"" she replied with ""You"" while she was at a friend, we joked around a bit. So, some questions.

1. Does she seem interested to you? As in, I always send first.

2. Should I try to ask her out again? Would it be weird?",2019-07-07 18:19:02,3,2,relationship_advice
59,ca7eop,berrydimp42,I [21M] dated a [36F] woman from Finland for two years and I think it destroyed my perception of relationships and my life.,"Hi all,

Apologies in advance for this being a long story. I wanted to make this as extensive and in as much detail as possible to get the advice I need to continue my life.

I'm an avid gamer, and my chosen poison is World of Warcraft. I raid in a high end guild, and thus im in a community of players who I don't particularly feel like sharing my feelings with.

Back when I was 17, I was in a PVP guild fighting other players out in the open world. There were several guilds (communities) all on a relatively quiet server and we all knew each others names and everyone had their own reputations that were often talked about across the server.

I had a bad reputation for being a dickhead back when I was 14 or so, but at this stage I had already matured and gotten past that. I joined another guild and had a girl message me and say something along the lines of 'don't ever talk to me, I don't want anything to do with you'. As you probably expect, we began talking and became close friends. 

She had a bad drinking habit, and would often call me on Skype, crying, but kept the details of why she was sad out of the equation. One day, she called and asked if I could read some messages that someone had been sending her. I agreed, and she screenshared a few months worth of conversation with me. It was some guy that she was 'online dating' but had never met IRL and he was using some extremely foul language online when talking to her, and I told her that if shes in a relationship and is getting this drunk on a daily basis because of how she's being treated then she needs to leave the relationship. In hindsight, I probably should've recommended some medical oriented advice and told her to seek help.

A week or so later, she had broken up with the guy and began playing and talking with me more on the game. After a few months, I expressed my feelings towards her and we set a date for us to meet IRL. I had turned 18 well before this FYI. A few months later, I boarded a plane to Finland with an overnight connection to Rovaniemi from Helsinki and my nerves were only getting worse by the hour. I arrived in Rovaniemi where she was waiting for me, we hugged and then drove to her place (80km away to a very small but popular town) with some coffee stops along the way so I didn't fall asleep in the car.

The first visit went as expected. We had sex, went out  quite often to eat / drink alcohol / explore. I stayed for a total of 3 weeks, and I absolutely loved it. In the 21 (almost 22 years of my life), I've never had a more fun and eye-opening experience. I've had a pretty shit and harsh childhood, repeatedly bullied in schools and some problems at home which led to me being diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was 16. I had therapy for a month or so, and then they signed me off. I'll get more into this later.

Despite there being a significant age gap between us, I never really saw it as a problem. She acted quite young for her age, and I (battle hardened I like to say) act quite mature for my age.

The first year of our relationship was great. A lot of trips to Finland. No arguments. We were open and honest about things with each other. There were a couple things that bugged me, but she assured me that it was fine. She was dead set on speaking to other guys online in a flirtatious manner. I spoke with her about it on a couple of occasions and she assured me that it was nothing, and that she would never cheat on me. (Red flag I missed I guess). She would always get involved in drama online, and it upset me and made me anxious all the time. I had people targeting me online from the aforementioned community, people trying to leak personal details about me and my family and pictures etc. I was able to push it aside, but it still made me feel sick to the stomach just thinking about the online drama and toxicity in general.

Me and my girlfriend (at the time) created a guild not long into our relationship and this was good too. We had a community of people under us that we would play with every single night. 

As time went on (2nd year), my girlfriend started to get extremely paranoid about who I was speaking to online. Kicking girls from the guild who talked to me, accusing me of cheating on her on a daily basis and having arguments on Discord with me almost every night.. and she was drinking.. again. Whenever she got drunk, she would accuse me of things and then the next day it would be 'real' in her mind. Still to this day (we speak from time to time) she says that I cheated on her a lot.

She began to be very abusive, threatening and manipulative. Giving me ultimatums such as 'delete this girl or you'll never hear from me again'. At first, I followed her wishes but in the future after many nights of the same shit, I began to defy these situations she was putting me in.

During the second year in the summer, I visited her and I had a friend (girl) of mine message me on Skypre about her return from her Holiday. This girl decided to tell me about an injury she sustained to one of her breasts from sunburn. I didn't particularly entertain the conversation, and just told her that she should see a doctor, get some cream for it and that I was at my girlfriends place. Afaik, I only log into my phone for Skype and somehow upon my return to the UK, My girlfriend revealed to me one night (when she was drunk and abusive) that she saw it by making a sly comment along the lines of 'Go rub some cream on XXX's boobs'. This made me really insecure and angry, and I snapped back at her and from this point forward, things went downhill fast.

During this same visit, we went out to a pub one night and one of her old friends showed up. His English was terrible, but enough to repeatedly ask me if we could have a threesome or if I would let him sleep with her. He was doing this in front of both of us, and I kept telling him No. She just looked at him blankly and when I told her to tell him to stop, she got angry with me and said he was only joking. Even after this, he continued and I told him that if he carried on, my pint glass would've been smashed over his head. I'm not a violent person, but this really got to me. The next day when I mentioned it, my girlfriend played ignorant.

I had noticed too that my girlfriend began being much more secretive. Hiding things from me, specifically telling me that she cant trust me and when I was with her (for two weeks), we had sex once instead of several times (as we did normally).

Another month or two passed, and we agreed to take a break. Two weeks in, I had a random Skype account add me and start asking me questions about my girlfriend and they told me to log into their account; so I did. At the same time, I noticed that my girlfriend had deleted me and blocked me everywhere but on WhatsApp she wrote 'im sorry it had to end like this'. The Skype Account had a huge chat on there from that night, where some guy had been threatening me and my girlfriend saying that he wanted to hunt me down and hurt me, kidnap me on my way to work and linked my address, her address, our families addresses etc. She got spooked, and said that she didn't want to hurt me so she would delete me. I got ahold of her eventually, and we both agreed to contact the police.

I spoke to my police, and handed over everything I had and their advice was to keep windows and doors locked. My girlfriend never went to the police and said that it didn't matter.

I'm very savvy when it comes to the online world, and I (with the help of some friends) tracked down the person who did this. A player from my guild, whom she was playing with that night. I presented her with the evidence, and she wasn't having any of it. They continued to play together and a week later we spoke again and decided to split.

She got together with this same guy, and this hurt. A few months later, his girlfriend (yeah, bet you didn't see this coming) messaged me and told me that she found out that he was cheating on her with my ex. She screenshotted a bunch of their conversations and showed me them, where he was wanting her to set up a camera in her bedroom for her to lure guys back to her place to sleep with for him to then get off with. Also, they spoke about baking food with her 'bodily fluids' and then serving it to the neighbours. This changed a part of me.

I was devastated, and words cannot describe the feelings I was going through after this. I began smoking quite heavily, and soon found myself going through 20 a day. My parents didn't know anything about the relationship until we split and I spilled the beans. My depression came back worse than ever. I quit my job, and spent countless nights awake till 5am, smoking, listening to depressing songs.

We split up in September 2017 and to this day, I still hurt sometimes. Some songs remind me of the now broken memories that I formed in Finland. I'm self employed full time, and my depression helps fuel an outstanding problem of procrastination that I have which isn't good for me financially.

I now find it hard to be attracted to girls around my age, and I keep looking for the positive traits in my ex girlfriend in new girls. No more online dating for me at least.

I just want some closure, and I feel at blame for how things ended and I feel like I could have prevented such an explosive ending.

Thanks all.",2019-07-07 14:29:54,1,4,relationship_advice
60,ca9x07,IllZooplanktonblame7,Realized I am an abusive spouse,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I realized the other day that I have been emotionally abusive to my spouse of five years. This culminated in an insane freakout at her in the car on the way to work a while back, with screaming and swearing. I hadn't realized how fucked up I was and how badly I was screwing up our marriage and relationship. I feel like I'm reliving my childhood where my mom would just screech and beat me and now I'm passing it along to our relationship (not towards the kids).

Now we're sleeping in separate beds and we're still at home together, but I am feeling pretty distraught and she wants 'space' to clear the fuzz from her head. I have been pretty emotionally needy the last few days because I'm trying to show her that I am committed to our relationship. Now I'm realizing that I was not actually helping by being extra nice and supportive, but just trying to control everything again. She's going out today to her parents' place for sunday dinner with the kids, so I'm going to do some constructive things for myself while she's gone. Bike ride, read, workout, mow the lawn, maybe do some baking or something, I've got about 5-6 hours of time.

First thing I did on the day that I flipped out was admit that I am depressed/angry and that I need help, so I got in contact with a therapist who I will be seeing on Wednesday. I have asked her about couples counseling and she said she would be willing to go and that it would be a good idea. However, I haven't been able to get her to set an appointment for our couples counselor. 

RA I am freaking out and I basically feel like I'm having a heart attack all the time. What do I do?",2019-07-07 18:12:55,4,2,relationship_advice
61,ca9wnn,burrLaFlame,"Advice with my younger brother, his girlfriend and his best friends.","Ok so let’s get a little background info. Let’s call my brother Jeff and his girlfriend Jenny. So Jeff and Jenny have been dating for about a year and a half now, it has been a high school relationship, they just recently graduated and are both 18 years old and I am 20.  They have decided to go to college together. Jeff and Jenny are always together, like every moment of every day. My bedroom is across the hall from Jeff’s. Since Jeff and Jenny are always together, I find myself and his best friends (good friends of mine as well) always third wheeling. Going out? Third wheel. Sitting at home? Third wheeling. My own family vacations, Third wheel. I have had girlfriends before but damn, not like this. 

Ok so, Jeff and Jenny are always together,  and there whole relationship is about sex, drugs, and partying. I’m telling you, there is nothing more to be seen or offered from this relationship. Jenny and Jeff both do not have any hobbies and did not play sports. Jeff even asks every week how he should breakup with Jenny.  The thing about Jenny is, is that she is absolutely clueless on how to do anything, or at least acts that way. Jenny also likes to play victim a lot, I.E. she is always sick, or someone is always talking about her when no one is, or how she will fake being sad or sick just to get attention and then act completely normal when she gets attention. And most of the time, if she ever is actually sick it’s alcohol induced. Every time you are third wheeling, Jenny likes to whisper in Jeff’s ear, at least 5-10 times an hour. It could be in the middle of a conversation, and Jenny will just pause it and whisper a whole new conversation in Jeff’s ear, making everyone else feel awkward as shit. Every time Jeff and Jenny hangout it seems as if Jenny is sad or crying, which leaves me confused. It doesn’t seem like Jeff really treats her well, but it seems like Jenny enjoys being treated poorly. Her father is extremely dominant, and controls the family, everything is at his whim. 

I find Jenny sleeping at my house even after my parents tell Jeff that she can’t, which is disrespectful and awkward for everybody. She is always worried about my mom or my dad or me being mad at her, but her behavior is abhorrent. They deserve to be mad at her. This Friday I came home from work to find her in my kitchen with nothing but my brothers t shirt and his boxers on. My mother saw was this and was so sad. My mother later went upstairs to tell her that she needs to go home, she just pretends to be asleep. In my brothers bed, with his underwear on. Or should I say pretends to be sick/blackout. 

Now I struggle with the idea of feeling selfish, like hey should I really be jealous of the time Jenny takes away from me. At one point I’m like fine just let him do his thing and they will definitely breakup because the relationship is toxic. On the other hand It seems like a good idea to say something. It seems as if his friends have stopped trying to hangout with him, I am even starting to detach slightly and it sucks. Worst part is, he claims he doesn’t even like or love her? I don’t get it. 


Bonus; so my family was planning a vacation this summer and they told Jeff that Jenny could not come because of logistical issues. So guess what, Jenny gets her family to plan the same vacation at the same place during the same week! How amazing and what a coincidence! Also I have to drive 15 hours for another trip, and  I told my family that I am not driving if Jenny is coming and they said she wasn’t. Well guess what she’s coming and I have to be stuck in the car with her and Jeff. And they will probably drink, and be all up on each other in the car. 

I just wanna be able to act like myself again around my family and my friends, every dinner, every day, I see her and most of the time it’s for the whole day. Everyone has to change their whole behavior just so they don’t make her feel upset or uncomfortable. Which in turn makes everyone else feel awkward and uncomfortable. He has had a girlfriend before, he wasn’t like this.

63,ca7bqe,lordcookie1,Is there something wrong with me? Relationship break up but feeling nothing,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

Weird question but thanks for the replies in advance. Myself and my partner of 5 years broke up around a week ago. I broke up with him as i wasn't very happy with him anymore and had been feeling unhappy for around a year. He is very upset and devastated about it even though I mentioned that i was unhappy/ wanted things to change and they didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Myself on the other hand am feeling pretty much fine apart from some thoughts like if i made the right decision. I have a positive outlook for the future and have some great friends which i'll be seeing a lot, The only thing is that around 5 days into the break up I went out and got drunk and met someone and had a casual fling. I felt a bit bad doing something so soon afterwards but one thing led to another. My now ex found out and said how could i move on so fast and was very upset.

&amp;#x200B;

I do feel bad but i mostly feel that I've spent so long worrying about how my ex feels and looking after him that now i want to do what i want. Is this normal behaviour after a break up, am I a bad person?

a month ago he texted some nice words to me after an argument. ''I can never forget you even if there is someone else in my life.  You will always come to my mind because you left a unique mark in me. whenever I touch someone else I will remember you, if I make love with someone else I will hear your screams in my ear but it will be disrespect to the person I am with'' 
 A few days ago he came to me and consult me about that girl and now let me tell about that girl. she was my ex's bff's ex. lol it looks complicated when I write like this, anyways. my ex and she were friends when we used to have relationship. in our exam year(it means half of last and half of this year) they became closer and started to flirting. people were telling me things like 'oh look they are lovers how can you still speak with him etc.' but I was aware of everything because he always told me everything. we are trusting each other. 
Like I said before a few days ago he came to me and asked for advice. next year he will go to university but this year he needs to study but also he want to date with that girl too. I asked him about his feelings and he said ''yeaahh I think I love her and she loves me too but im confused what should I do?'' those words hurt me like hell but I told him in cold blood: ''Look you need to make smart decisions and don't let anyone interfere you from doing anything'' and he said ''no she isn't a person like that'' then I told him ''boy you can never ever know a person fully and certainly but if you really want to be with her nobody can stop you it's your choice'' after a silent moment he changed the subject and he asked me about my love life if I want any relationship. (I forget mention about this info I will be moving to another city in 2 months and that's why I tryna keep everything cool because I don't want to lose our communication even in next 10years because I really care about him) and I told him ''no I don't want any kind of relationship in my life because i've been very sad and broken in past and I can't deal with anyone I just wanna live my life in peace' 
yeah guys I think that was all, we still attached to each other in a sexsual way but im trying to stay cool but pretending like this tires me. what should I do? what should I feel? im feeling mentally sick I also have very big problems in my life at least I need to figure this out waiting for your advice.

66,ca9qxb,unexpectedkebab,Boyfriend (22m) doesn’t understand that I (23f) need alone time.,"This is in relation to the day I have spent with my boyfriend, We are currently at my parents house looking after my cats while they are on holiday for three days, we live together and live only a ten minute drive away from my parents house. 

Today we have spent practically all day together (the same as yesterday), we woke up, had breakfast together, played fortnite together, went to the gym together, spent an hour swimming and sitting in a spa together, went shopping, went back to our own house to get stuff and then came back to my parents house around 4. Around this time I started to feel really really irritable with him, which is not something I feel often and just found that I really wanted to be alone. Boyfriend understood this initially, however despite me asking for time alone and needing peace and quiet he immediately comes into the sitting room I’m in and starts bugging me with questions. 

I get up and go into another room, again, and he doesn’t follow me this time, I spend a little time reading my book and having some food before he joins me and has his food, I then say I’ll play more fortnite together, which we do for a while before I grow bored and even more irritable. So i decide to continue reading for a bit. He then comes upstairs and says he’s coming to have a nap, which I then figure I may as well go downstairs to not disturb him. He flips out at this and says he was coming up to spend time with me and lie down with me and that I’ve barely spent any time with him all day and he’d like to feel as if he has a girlfriend. He then announces that he’s going back to the flat and gets in his car and leaves. 

He said how he’s a guest in this house and it would be nice to spend time with me, which I kind of get, yet he starts using examples of that he can’t just nap anywhere or leave things where he wants, which isn’t true because it’s literally just me and him, and this isn’t an unfamiliar house, before we lived together he would spend every other weekend here for two years. 

I feel like he just does not understand that I need time to myself, I am an introverted person and struggle to be around other people for extended periods of time, and today it got to the point that I just felt suffocated. He says that me reading a book was practically the same as me being on my phone all day and ignoring him and has suggested that I stop ‘playing the victim’ and accept responsibility for this. 

We don’t have a bad relationship, but i seriously struggle with the fact that he cannot be alone, he doesn’t know how to enjoy his own company and constantly needs to be around me or spending time with me, unless he’s playing fortnite with friends. I don’t appreciate the fact that he doesn’t understand why I would want to be alone and why, when I’m in an awful mood and feeling suffocated, I would want to be in another room. We never have time away from each other, except for when he is visiting his parents, every single evening and weekend is spent constantly in each other company, so it’s not as if we never spend time together. 

Am i missing the point here? Should I be spending time with him, even if I’m needing to be alone?",2019-07-07 17:59:06,5,2,relationship_advice
67,ca56fk,Throwadvice00,What can I (25M) do to regulate my boyfriends (32M) sometimes overbearing jealousy?,"  

Hey Reddit,

as my post in this sub suggests, I’m looking for advice in my relationship.  
 

I (25M) never had a relationship except for the one I’m in now. I might want to add that I never cared so much about it, I never thought of myself ending up in a relationship, I pictured myself just being by myself basically until the day I die. I never really tried being in a relationship. As a teen, some girls might have been interested in me and I might have been in them, at least I was curious, but I was always very distant and silent and never made the moves. I had some very chaotic teenage years in that my caregivers could not handle their relationships so I was not planning in getting one myself.  
 

Growing out of these years and slowly becoming a more and more independent adult, I felt more and more lonely.   
 When I was 23, I finally met someone with whom I could communicate so well and finally share all the things I had, until then, silently carried with me and it was a huge relief. It came completely unexpected and different than I would have ever expected. I was glad it worked both ways. From the day we met, we saw each other almost every day and it made both our lives so much better. After a couple of months, he (32M) asked me if I wanted to be in a relationship. I told him I would not know, since I don’t know what comes with it and if it is my kind of thing, but we agreed to just try out. It worked out quite well with a few ups and downs and changes of definitions, but eventually we managed and moved in together about a year later since both of us needed a new place to stay. 

Having said all of this, I have one and only one huge problem in this relationship and I don’t know how to handle it.   
 It’s his jealousy.   
 He has been cheated on before and it hit him quite hard. He has been cheated on in relationships but also by ‘good friends’ of his. He gets reminders of it on a regular basis because it just jumps up in his mind again and again.  
 He is the most loving and caregiving person I ever knew in my entire life, I’d like to support him and help him overcome this, but I have no idea how to.

I spend most of my freetime with him.   
 I am having a hard time to make time for my other friends, but occasionally it works out.   
 If I then miss the bus I wanted to take, because somebody was still telling me something interesting or I decided to stay for another drink, enjoying my time with another friend, I would write him a short notice so he doesn’t worry.    
 

I would already know anyway what will await me once I come home. He will be pissed and distant, refusing to have a nice time (since I came back so late we could not have any nice time together anymore, so why not have some bad time together instead), telling me that I was wrong doing so, sometimes even threaten to cheat on me with somebody else. C’mon man, I was just having a beer with an old schoolfriend of mine or something. But he doesn’t see that, he is always expecting the worst from me.   
 He says he loves me so much, he wants to spend every moment with me. So… what? Is it bad that I want to spend time alone or with other people, too? Does this conflict with love?   
 I don’t think so, but I cannot make that clear to him. He is emotionally quite dependant on me. He just loves to be around and in touch with me, which is really nice and I appreciate it. He always gives me the feeling of being great and being able to achieve everything. I feel really lucky to be with him and did not ever meet anybody with whom I could live together like this, but these jealousy-things are just too much for me. I love my freedom and I like being spontaneous.   
 

Most of the times that he gets pissed because of that, I get too and I leave it to him to handle. I’d assure him that nothing happened, that he is the one I decided to be with and would over and over again and that I would have no reason to cheat. But what else could – or SHOULD - I do? I then just leave him be distant and do my own things until he eventually gets better and realizes he overreacted. This can take hours to days.  
 

What can I do to make this better? How should I behave so there is minimum stress about me meeting other people, spending time with them and not staying in contact with him during the whole time? Please understand me right, I don’t want to break up, I’m very happy in this relationship. It’s just this point that is unbearably annoying and stresses both of us out.  
 How can I behave so he feels less of this stress and is in a better condition to handle his jealousy? How can I help him in doing so while still doing all the things I want to do?

I’ll already thank anyone reading through this and giving me his/her thoughts on this.

TL;DR: My boyfriend is super jealous when I spend time with other people, especially if he doesn’t know them well. I cannot take this anymore, but I don’t want to break up. I know it’s a process that needs to happen – but what can I do to help this process?",2019-07-07 09:48:23,3,9,relationship_advice
68,ca9qg5,Hutch98x,"Girl (19F) I’ve been seeing says she’s getting bored, how do I keep our relationship alive and strong","I’ve been seeing this girl for almost 7 months now and and we are not in an “official relationship”. I’m 21F and I’m fine with not putting a label on things until she feels she’s ready. She’s insecure and has had trouble with past relationships with people cheating and being dishonest and her guard is up with me. I always reassure her and I truly love her with all my heart. We rarely argue about big things, mostly bicker and have small falling outs but nothing to impact the relationship itself. I feel we’re coming out of the “honeymoon period” of the relationship; we’re not having sex as often, the affection lacks on some days but is better on others. 
We’ve spoke that she’s getting a bit bored and wants things to go back to the way it was before. We try to do different things when we see each other, go to different places, go for dinner and try to keep things moving along. I’m trying my best to reassure her that I don’t want to lose her and want to do anything that will help. 
What can I do to keep my relationship alive and strong after the honeymoon phase? How can I help her and help myself. Any advice would be greatly appreciated",2019-07-07 17:57:59,1,2,relationship_advice
69,ca9n38,grephelp,Am I wrong to feel like my mom is overstepping?,"(I posted this on r/advice as well)

I honestly never thought I’d find myself in this position. I have a pretty good relationship with my mom. She’s always been supportive and trusting of my choices, but now she’s completely disregarding what I want, and trying to “control” how I transition into a different career.

Long story short, I’ve been in all sorts of jobs, none of them financially or intellectually satisfying, so at the beginning of the year I decided to go back to school to study information systems/cybersecurity. I’m working on my Associate’s and I am really enjoying what I am learning. I’m about halfway through the program now.

My husband and I have always been very frugal. We’re living on his income while I go to school full time, and money is tight, but it’s worth it to us that I get to concentrate full time on my schooling.

I have not always made the most reasonable decisions: I have a bachelor’s degree in history, for example; I have quit jobs just because I didn’t like them; My husband and I moved across the country a few years ago to experiment with living in a new place and attempting to find new careers, and that really didn’t work out...

So I acknowledge that I have a “track record” of making emotional decisions. But now I’m working on my Associate’s and trying to follow through with this new career path. 

Yesterday my mom texted me out of the blue telling me that basically she “found the job for me.” She went on and on about this tech company in my area and how interesting the place sounds, and how the pay is great and I wouldn’t even need to finish my degree program.

But I want to finish my degree program. I want to get the degree and have the options and opportunities that come with having a degree and getting certifications, etc. I have talked to industry professionals, and they have told me that with my lack of experience in tech and my goal to promote and not just be entry-level for the rest of my life, it’s important that I get at least an Associate’s. I texted her back and thanked her for thinking of me and told her the above, etc., and she proceeded to call me.

I told her how much I appreciate her help and support and how she was being a very loving parent for trying to help me out— she interrupted me, scoffed, and told me “not to discount this amazing opportunity.” I tried to explain to her what I said above about wanting to finish the degree and how it’s important and she basically just dismissed it and was like, “it’s just a certificate.” 

I just kept trying to tell her that the job she heard about sounded like a great job, but that it isn’t what I want. It’s not even the kind of job I want! Not all “tech jobs” are the same, Mom. 

She told me that I don’t trust her opinion, and I only trust “researchers” (whatever that means), and she said “come on, what world do they live in?” I asked her if she trusted me to make decisions for myself and she said she does, but it doesn’t feel like it!

At this point she reminded me that I am financially indebted to her. I told her if it was all about money, I could write her a check right now. She said it wasn’t about the money, and was like, “I’ve never brought that money up before, have I?” And I was thinking like, no you haven’t but you are bringing it up now!

And then she was like, “you’re almost thirty...” And I told her that I know that, and I think it’s ok that I don’t have my shit figured out yet and that my new path is part of working on that! But that didn’t seem to satisfy her.

We had only a brief but heated conversation about it all and, since I was in the middle of an activity when she called, she said we should talk about it more at a later date. We both ended the phone call saying that we loved each other, and that we should just wait to talk about my hopes and desires career path in person sometime, but I could tell she was still really frustrated.

Then later that day she started texting me job postings for random jobs!

It just feels weird, like she wants to control the path I take. Don’t get me wrong, I know that I am so lucky to have a loving supportive parent, but am I wrong to feel like she’s overstepping and not respecting my boundaries as an adult? I am already filled with so much self-doubt, and all of this is sowing new feelings of insecurity.",2019-07-07 17:50:24,1,2,relationship_advice

Last night he (31m) was a bit drunk but not too drunk and he told me that rape is a myth and it doesn't happen in real life, because women are usually into it, they just don't want to admit. And that when women say no they actually mean yes because it's a game and they want to seem shy and cute and when they say no and then they're touched they usually let it happen because they're horny. So I was a little mad at him and tried to change his mind, like no, it's not how it works, no means no. I told him it happened to me (5 years ago), happened to other women, ask 10 women that you know and you'll be surprised. He told me why didn't I just fight back. I said because I said no, and he didn't listen, he was 6 inches taller than you, and a big guy, I was scared. He said then I was probably into it. And then he broke up because he feels that I insulted his height. Please somebody help me understand what just happened. He won't talk to me.

I'm sorry to hurt you, but I'm not going to continue a relationship that I don't see as my forever, I'm sorry I don't feel that way with you. I didn't feel what I needed to feel when I met you. "" 

I told her in the begining to take it slow because she'd only been separated from her ex husband for 8 months and the divorce was just finalized less than 2 months ago, but she pursued the relationship. She said she loved me first.   

A few months ago, I commented on a female co-worker's picture, but it wasn't inappropriate. I just asked her was it busy tonight because I thought about picking up a shift. Then my ex said ""You're just like my ex husband."" Then she blocked me on Facebook Messenger and unfriended me. Then she apologized, added me back and unblocked me. But this time after she left me, I told her to block and unfriended me because I can't do it to her because I love her so much, but she didn't.

74,ca52o8,threwitonthegrnd,I (24M) have a picture of an ex’s daughter that I can’t part with.,"Had to make a throwaway because my current girlfriend knows my regular account.
But the story goes like this. I dated a girl last year for nine months, and during that time I raised her daughter with her. She was not mine, but I never had any intention of treating her otherwise. I entered the relationship and she was 3 months old. I know now that I shouldn’t have been so eager to take that role only after 3 months and waiting to meet the child should have also been a concern of hers. But love is blind and here we are. The relationship didn’t work out despite her best efforts, but I don’t regret anything from it and I’m thankful for the lessons I learned. 

Fast forward to today and after going through a bout of depression and basically mourning the loss of a child I’ll never see again, I write in a journal. It’s just something that really helps me and I’d actually recommend it to anyone going though anything. Now I haven’t wrote in a couple months for whatever reason, but today I just felt the need to put my thoughts on paper. While finding the next clean page a picture fell out of my journal; A picture of her daughter. Let me be clear that while I no longer am in love with her mother, we raised a child though the most important development stages. So many firsts... And they both will always mean something to me. But I do not feel what I did and used to look at that picture when I wrote. She was my light, my world. As soon as the photo landed in my lap it was as if I involuntarily started crying.

All the smaller details aside, I still haven’t gotten over losing that child and I don’t think I ever will. But I can’t throw this photo away. I physically tried and just couldn’t.. I can’t hold onto it because if my girlfriend finds it she would only think of the worst I’m sure no matter how I tried to explain it. I do care for my current lover, and even though it’s only been a few months I believe this has a future. I don’t want to let my past have such a prominent effect on my current relationship. Just the sight of that photo seemingly undid months of therapy,medication, and grieving. I’m just looking for advice on what to do. I know something as frivolous as a little photo doesn’t make a lot of sense, but those of you that can relate in any way, I’d appreciate some guidance.",2019-07-07 09:32:41,7,10,relationship_advice

Besides putting a roof over our heads and feeding us, she's never taken interest in me as a person, and is quite narcissistic. She pretty much uses me so she can have someone to talk at, or to make me do things for her.
She relies on me and my siblings a lot, and I resent her for it. She's been here for as I long as I was born, and never had much interest in learning english. She's always been a lazy person. All of her excuses are 'I'm too old, it's hard for me to learn anything new' she's been saying that since I was a child... and now she's 70.
I'm getting very fed up and tired of helping her do things, and the fact that I take a good whole day out of my schedule to visit her, just so she can hear her own voice. There's rarely any ""how's things been?"" It's a very one sided relationship.
The relationship with my dad is pretty much the same, except he isn't needy and doesn't want to engage in conversation with me at all unless it's to do with translating. I always leave feeling drained and unhappy.

At the same time, I know her and my father are getting old and frail and I should try and keep in regular contact with them. Or I'll feel very guilty when they pass away one day.

I don't know what to tell him, but now this is an issue between him and her. Any advice I could give to him?

78,ca9ex4,adviceTA1694,I [28/m] am worried my girlfriend [23/f] moving in with me will be a bit of a disaster.,"We met online a year ago and we really hit it off.  We have a lot of things in common and she's gorgeous and a bit out of my league looks-wise, however she loves me and said she gets along with me better than she has with anyone she's ever met.  We both talked about it and agreed that she's going to move in with me in September.

The thing that worries me is that she lives in Arizona (where she grew up) with her Grandparents, and I currently live in Northern California in a 2BDRM flat that my flatmate is going to move out of around the same time.

We've gone back and forth and visited eachother a half a dozen times in the last year or so and we'v had a lot of fun and formed a strong bond, but I've had a lot of my friends tell me it's too soon to move in together.  My thoughts generally are that we'll never really know if we work unless we're together and not long distance.

At first things were fine, and I was really excited about her moving but I feel like as the time is getting closer to her moving in, her personality is changing a lot.  She's become a lot more critical and demanding, less interested in sex, and just generally less enjoyable to be around.  I'm starting to have a lot of doubts, but she's already committed in various ways to the move (has a new job lined up, etc.), and lowkey dropped an ultimatum a few weeks ago that if I backed out of moving in together she'd end the relationship.

I'm just not sure how to proceed.  I do love her and care about her deeply, but based on how her behavior has changed in the last few months I'm kinda worried.  I have been with people who have mood swings due to mental illness or medication and I'm not getting any of the signs her recent behavior change is temporary or due to environmental factors.

We're both pretty sensitive to criticism and conflict, so open communication about issues we have with the other has been difficult.  I'm pretty much set on us trying to move in together, but in the past I've stayed in relationships far past the point where I was really unhappy.  Any advice on moving in together?

79,ca9ele,Sharlsm29,My (19F) boyfriend (20M) may have depression and I don't know how to help him,"A little background on my relationship:
I've been together with my bf for almost 2 years now, our r/s isn't perfect and has had many ups and downs (mostly downs). This is my first relationship so it was really tough on me during our first big fight/breakdown. My bf is not clinically diagnosed with depression but he has shown symptoms like anxiety, irritability, self-criticism, negative thoughts, *TRIGGER WARNING* self harm and has almost attempted suicide and many other symptoms. I don't know if all these counts as him having depression but I think it does right.. 

Recently, my bf has been very stressed out by school work and his personal life, he has been busy with planning and arranging/packing things for both his brothers' weddings which meant he was really busy and we could not spend as much time together (I am also working) and things with school work hasn't been going well due to irresponsible groupmates and rushing for submission deadlines.

Right now he just feels so out of place and alone as he felt used by his family, in the sense that he did so much for his bros' wedding but ended up not being talked to/being treated seriously or things just not going his way. He doesn't have many close friends and he's used to thinking that no one likes him/cares about him (he speaks from experience) and he only has me to rent to and speak to everyday.

Since the beginning of our relationship, there have been many times where he broke down and felt like he didn't belong in his own home and just wanted to get away from everything. No one in his family understands him and they treat him as if he's still a little kid (he's the youngest of his 2 brothers), and whenever he tries to speak out they'll just brush his words off and say things like ""you don't know what I've been through yet"" ""you're just thinking too much"" etc.

Of course all of our problems in the relationship aren't about his family, we've had our differences too but I made this post because we had a small disagreement earlier today. He spoke about wanting to take antidepressants and i was against it. I just thought it would be bad if he takes them, and someday becomes reliant on them. I wanted him to be able to try to overcome these negative feelings and thoughts by himself. Obviously I can't put myself in his shoes and feel exactly what he feels and understand what he went through but I do try my best to encourage him, talk to him positively/see things on the positive side and support him as much as I can. But seeing this go on for 2 years, I feel like Ive run out of things to say and I can't help him and it sucks A LOT. He already has that mindset of ""my life is never going to be better since I've already been through so much crap"". 

I've tried asking him to go for therapy, and the first time I mentioned it, he freaked out and said something along the lines of ""I'm not crazy why do I have to go for therapy?"". The next few times I asked him to try to go for some counselling, he would say maybe but still be reluctant. Earlier when we were having our disagreement, he initially said he may try going to a counsellor, but ended up insisting that he needs/wants to take antidepressants as he has a cousin who's a nurse, told him that it's actually okay to take them. He said talking to someone isn't going to help him as how are they even going to help? it's not as if they'll change his life immediately, and then from then insisted he could take antidepressants if he needs to. I've also advised him on finding other methods to destress like exercising, finding something he likes to do, scream into a pillow and all that jazz. 

I just need some advice on whether or not he really should take them (I've done only little research on what antidepressants can do for you, saw that some experienced bad side effects while some made them feel so much better) and what else can I do or say to support him and make him feel better. Any help is appreciated, I can only say so much to him before it gets repetitive and tiring. 

TLDR; Bf has symptoms of depression, history of bad/unhappy stuff happening to him and was thinking of taking antidepressants but I was against it. Just need advice on whether he should take them or not and how I can continue to be there for him and support him.",2019-07-07 17:31:05,6,2,relationship_advice

My(20) partner(21) and I have been together for  almost 3 years &amp; have had our problems like any other couple. I make my mistakes as do they.however, after a recent argument over taking responsibility over our actions &amp; being honest..they opened up about a lie they had told me, which was that they never had an ex, nor did that ex they had mentioned cheat on my partner.

I don’t know how to react. This “ex” has been something they held over my head. When we first started dating they had mentioned that they were cheated on &amp; my previous relationship had been.. well not the best. My partner &amp; I didn’t have the best communication with one another at first &amp; that was something we had to learn along the way. However as we progressed they would tell me that the people I was hanging out with were trying to get in my pants &amp; that I needed to stop talking to them because they felt uncomfortable &amp; felt like something would happen between us &amp; so I cut communication&amp; explained to them that I just wanted to respect my partner &amp; their feelings. There was a lot of I don’t want anything to happen between you &amp; this &amp; this person after that so I practically just stopped talking to all the people that made my partner uncomfortable. (I now realize I should’ve projected my feelings about not wanting to cut out so many people from my life) 

I honestly just wanted to reassure them that I wouldn’t cheat. But the day my childhood friend dropped me off from work as a favor. I was accused of cheating &amp; wasn’t allowed to explain myself. (Partner had tried to surprise me by coming over without telling me &amp; me being dropped off by someone they thought was a stranger weren’t a great mix, my fault however since I never let them know it was happening). 

After those events, he wouldn’t let me go on my phone while I was with them nor let me go out with people they didn’t know or trust when I brought them up. Honestly I just felt guilty about even wanting to go out with any of my friends when they invited me that after a while I just started saying no before telling my partner. 

I don’t even know where I’m going with this anymore in all honesty, I don’t know how to even explain how this ex was held over my head &amp; I’m sorry for wasting anyone’s time. I think i might’ve just needed to vent it out? I don’t know. I don’t know.. how I should even handle this information. In my perspective it’s a lot to take in..?

81,ca5ist,Throwaway868586u6ut,"Partner (F36) of 15 years has no sex drive, and never has.","Background. I am M(36)

We met at 21. We were both virgins but had done lesser stuff with previous partners. We had sex for the first time 14 months into our relationship. 

We got married after 7 years. I love my wife more than anything. She is the perfect person for me. My best friend. I am fairly confident she feels the same way about me. I know she loves me. but there is just 1 thing.

Her low sex drive. Not just the amount of sex, but the type of sex.

She doesn't initiate sex, or even satisfy herself.

I knew this going into this marriage. She admitted it. She told me maybe she would open up later in the marriage once she feels more secure. 

Its been 15 years. We have sex once a month, always missionary. i have only made her orgasm a few times, and that was by hand play and licking.

I want more than this for the rest of my life. I thought It would be okay, but I just want more. I have discussed this with her several times, and she tries for a day or two, then drops off. 

I cannot imagine a better life partner for me in terms of personality. She is an amazing woman. I can see us being happy and growing old. 
Its just this one thing. This lack of sex drive.

Open marriage is off the table. It wont work

My thought pattern right now, I want to experience more in the world in terms of sex. But leaving my wife would be the worst decision of my life. Its a terrible move that will ruin so much.

I dont think talking again about it will help. Shes not sexual. Its who she is. I cannot ask her to change who she is. I also knew it when we got married.

What would you do in my shoes. Anyone gone through this? Should I end this loving relationship just because I want more sex...",2019-07-07 10:39:57,23,6,relationship_advice
82,ca99rl,dadwithaquestion99,"I (30, M) am worried about grandma visitng my daughter (8) and bringing up her mom who split on us. How do I politely tell grandma not to?","My daughter’s biological mom, Jane, split on me and our daughter, Parker, when she was just a baby. Jane did a bunch of crazy shit and I got full custody of Parker. Jane remarried and moved far away. She stopped contact with me for years, then out of the blue asked my wife to adopt Parker, and she gladly did so. Parker knows about Jane, but does not remember her and has not asked about her. She’s not interested in Jane, yet.

Parker’s biological grandma(Janes mom) has built a relationship with Parker. Mostly thanks to my wife, she thought it would be unfair to keep grandma away and not be able to know her granddaughter (and vice versa)just because her daughter fucked things up and encouraged me not to shut grandma totally out. Grandma lives far away, so it’s mostly been letters, text messages, and FaceTiming but Parker knows and loves grandma. 

Grandma is coming to visit us for a week for the first time ever. We are worried she might try to bring up Jane to Parker because in a recent FaceTime call, my wife said grandma was telling Parker a story and brought “aunt Jane” into the story. It was almost as if grandma was hoping Parker would ask “who is aunt Jane?” so grandma could talk about her or something. Grandma had never spoken about her until that call, it’s just been kind of an unspoken rule not to talk about her but I think I should layout boundaries now. If she brought up “aunt Jane” on a FaceTime call in front of my wife, who knows what she might say to Parker if we aren’t close by when she is visiting. 

So how do I tell grandma “hey don’t talk about your cunt of a daughter to Parker yet it’s not your place” But in a nicer way?",2019-07-07 17:19:28,3,2,relationship_advice

84,ca9888,TheUnsmoteable,We (27f/29m) haven't had sex in two years. I don't know if we can save this. I'm terrified.,"We've been together six and a half years. Sex was (typically) no problem at all for the first year or two, but then started petering out slowly. It's now been two years since we last had sex - I can't even remember when or where it was any more.

I am definitely still a sexual person. But after so long, I struggle to see him in that way. He's said he feels similar too. He's a really good looking guy, but he doesn't excite me sexually any more and even when we kiss I feel a little uncomfortable.

We've been in couple's counselling for 6 months. Nothing has improved. Our communication did, for sure, but when it finally came to the ""sexy"" homework we just.... Never did it. Kept putting it off. In our last session we expressed our frustration at ourselves, and the therapist essentially told us we need to have a real think about whether we truly have the motivation to work on saving this relationship.

I *know* from all this it feels so obvious it's over.... But... He's my absolute best friend in the world. I love him so much. We've been through a lot together - he was with me when my dad died, he helped me through it all. We've both had problems with our mental health, both on meds, both see our own therapists.

I laugh with him still more than I have with anyone else. We have a lovely flat and *so much stuff* and a cat. The idea of how we'd even begin to sort all that stuff out, and not be partners after so long is terrifying. I feel like I'm frozen in fear, and I have been for a long time - and time keeps ticking by...

I also can't ignore that I do fear never finding this connection again. And I do fear that nobody would want me. I've been diagnosed with PCOS which has made me gain a lot of weight. I also recently found out I've lived my entire life with undiagnosed ADHD which I'm now getting proper treatment for, which we believe has been a big factor in me developing binge eating disorder over the last few years. I'm very big on fat positivity. I am realistic about improving my health where my weight *does* affect it, but I also think 'fat' shouldn't be a dirty word, and that we should love our bodies no matter what they look like. Shame is a killer. And yet - I've never been single with this body. I've never been sexual with this body. I am terrified of the idea of dating again one day, and people finding me repulsive. It's a struggle.

I don't know what to do. I really don't. I know when I write this stuff it seems obvious that it's over. But why is it so hard? On one hand it feels like we've tried and failed, and that's the best we can do. But I feel angry at us that we've done all this therapy and maybe not really tried at all. Like just turning up was enough to placate ourselves, put the break up talk on hold, convince ourselves we were doing something about it - but never really engaging when it came to working on the sex stuff. But then I also think, maybe that just shows that it's not right any more. That we can't force it.

I don't know. I'm terrified. I'm unhappy at work, struggling with ADHD, have a very small friendship group and am estranged from my entire family. He IS my family. If I lose him, I have nothing.",2019-07-07 17:15:54,3,2,relationship_advice

Its little longer and there are other things described but it all connects together if you read it whole. Thanks)  
Hi, i never wrote anything like this. So it may be a mess for some of you. Iam not a native english speaker so i hope i will get things that i have on my mind, right here to the text.

My name is not important... Iam a 20 years old guy, with as you already read by title, Butterfly disease (Dystrophic one).

&amp;#x200B;

And i need advice, from you. All of you. All my life i was playing video games (mostly WoW,ARK: Survival Evolved and stuff.) and i still play alot to this day. I was maybe weird or maybe iam weird to this day i dont know :-D But i never felt like i needed a girl. a Love. Until 8 months ago, i met somebody. Somebody that changed my life. On my ARK server we met, i fell in love. Sadly, she was already taken and it broke my hearth. I still love her to this day, and the love just doesnt fade away. But thats another story.......

I want to find a love, thats all i want. I dont know what to do... I tried Badoo and some dating sites, no girl just wants to even try to chat... I never felt like this but iam missing something, a piece of me, that can only be there if i have somebody to love, and somebody who loves me back... Thing is. Even when iam 20. I am not, and i will never be self-sufficient. I need help with changing bandages. I spent time for changing bandages and all this stuff every single day of my life....It affects skin, but it does affect inner organs and stuff. Right now i have very hard time to even eat... So there is a chance i will get a PEG (in short something that is on your belly and you put food right into it.....sorry if this made you sick) and i wonder, is there a woman that would live me? is there? I dont know where to search or what to do....Lately i feel very depressed, i will admit i cry sometimes.. Why do i have to be 20 years old and 20 years alone...Why do i have to feel all of this everyday. Maybe iam just weak, i know for sure there are people that are much worse than me...But i just feel this way lately....All i want is love... But as person with DEB i dont know what to do... Where to search. And if there is a chance for me at all. In my free time i take care of discord server and ark servers...I dont go to school... I dont go to work... So i dont know many people. I dont go outside. Because i dont know somebody that would go with me or places that i could go. Iam not that type of person that would go to party, and clubs and stuff. I would much rather prefer to stay at home, watch a movie and cuddle, but thats just me.

&amp;#x200B;

Iam writing this here, because i need every advice i can get. If you read this thank you, and if you responded to this. Thank you alot, it means alot that somebody out there, cares and spents their time to atleast respond. If there is anything you would like to know more, about me, my story or just anything at all.

88,ca7n12,Shineaiggy29,"28F, been with my boyfriend 31M for over 5 years. He continually makes me feel trapped in an unhappy relationship and I dont know if I am being unreasonable or if I should leave.","We are a textbook toxic relationship. We both have anger issues as well as food addiction/weight issues, although he says we are perfectly fine. He talks to me like a stern father talking to a daughter instead of two adults. I feel no mutual respect from him. I also deal with major depressive disorder as well as anxiety and I tend to internalize things because I have trouble getting the words out. He forces me to talk about my issues when I'm not comfortable because he says it makes him feel better to know what's going on. I also tend to cry alot involuntarily. I dont mean to and it generally happens regardless if i try to hold it off. Not usually sobbing either, mostly just some tears. He always rolls his eyes and says things like ""what now"" or ""I need you to talk to me"", even though when I get like that talking can be very difficult.
I've tried bringing these things up to him, but it is always ""I am being defensive"" or ""things dont change over night"". Or he will just start saying that he deals with the things I do wrong without complaining and puts it back on me.
He also revealed that when he was younger he was evaluated for sociopathy, although dont know what was determined.
My family all want me to get out. They say even when I appear happy they can tell how miserable I am.
I understand nobody is perfect and I try so hard, but I feel like the lesser person in the relationship and I dont know what to do. 5 years is a long time to throw away.

89,ca92pz,catgrandma744,"My eldest (M22) is moving out, he and his younger brother (13) are feuding over the “family” cat.","I’ve scrolled a bit through this sub and my problem might be small potatoes compared to others, but it’s quickly turning into a shit storm in my home. 

My oldest son (Sam) graduated from a university a few states away this past May and has been staying at home this summer while he saves for an apartment. We’ve all been very excited for him, tagging along to look at buildings, shop for furniture, etc. The issue arose when his little brother (Will) learned that he planned on taking the cat. 

They both have a relationship with the cat - she doesn’t seem to have a clear favorite most days, and I’d say they both put in the same amount of work when it comes to taking care of her. What complicates the situation is that they both have different “claims” to her. 

She wasn’t originally considered the “family cat”, as Sam saved her from a shelter when he was 13. He was her primary caregiver for the next 5 years. He used his allowance to buy her food and litter, fed her regularly, and cleaned up after her. She’s his baby, and many in our family (my self included) call him her dad. 

Will’s argument is that while his brother’s been away at school (4 years), he’s been the primary caregiver. He doesn’t pay for necessities the way Sam did, but he did feed and watch after the cat while his brother was away. 
I saw this argument coming a mile away with Will very pointedly referring to the cat as “his” cat around Sam, and Sam very pointedly ignoring him. I did not, however, anticipate it being this bad. 

Sam, though generally a very patient and kind person, has clearly become annoyed and given up on ignoring his brother’s not-so-subtle protests. He’s very plainly stated that the cat is his, and when he leaves so will she. 

Will has become depressed and angry, both with his brother for taking the cat and with me for not stopping him. I do think that Sam is the rightful owner of the cat, he rescued her and cared for her for years. While I understand Will’s being upset, I didn’t think for a second that Sam would leave her with us for good. I’ve never seen us as being more than glorified pet sitters, and now that he has the means I completely understand him wanting his cat back. 

Am I wrong to let him take her? How do I console Will, and mend his relationship with his brother. 

TL;DR: My younger son has been caring for his brother’s cat for years. Now that he’s back from college, my eldest wants his cat back and it’s started a feud between them.",2019-07-07 17:03:15,6,2,relationship_advice
90,ca92fc,CatIsTooFat,I blocked my ex gf for this reason.. am I insane?,"So basically I [F/19] was with this girl [F/19] for 6 months. We were introduced through a mutual friend and we got talking and as our talks progressed, I realised she was absolutely mad in the head.. which made me fall in love with her. For the first few months it was an absolute dreamlike situation and we both felt we had found our soulmates. 

After the 6 month mark, while I was out of town, her friends (who are quite promiscuous) dragged her to a frat party and there she met a guy and proceeded to get together with him. As soon as I was informed of this I absolutely lost it and proceeded to dump her. She would plead with me to take her back and I would always refuse as she had broken all trust I had for her and I requested her to move on from me. At first I was confident she wouldn’t take long to move on from me but it didn’t turn out to be so as even after months passed by, she was still stuck on me and even after repeated requests by me to move on she wouldn’t listen.

Now what I’m about to say might sound a bit weird, but bear with me. The other day I was smoking a doobie a vision flashed in my head and it dawned upon me, I actually do have a solution for this. Although she cheated, I was still rooting for her to achieve higher (no pun intended) success in life and the way to do this was to block her everywhere as a sacrifice. To never have contact with her ever again. I know it sounds mental I really do but it was the only way. And so I did, I prayed and wished for her to become the best, and I blocked her. 

She doesn’t know this is the reason and I’m never going to tell her either. My question to you is, is this idea insane or sweetly and simply put, genius?..",2019-07-07 17:02:38,5,2,relationship_advice

Since we started dating I knew he was an alcoholic. He drinks about a case of beer a day, everyday. It never seemed to effect his mood but when we moved in together is when I noticed how angry he gets for no reason. He gets pissed off at nothing, yells at me and busts holes in our walls. He got mad at the cats once and broke our living room window. No he’s never hit me but I get super scared when he gets like this. My whole body freezes and my anxiety shoots through the roof.

Lately though he’s been lying to me a lot. He lies about who he hangs out with, where he is. Even the other day he lied about working over time so he could hang out with his friends. I feel shitty saying this but I only found that out because I went through his phone. I shouldn’t have done that but none of his story’s from the last couple of weeks were adding up. I’m pretty sure he’s cheating on me and indefinitely know he talks shit about me to our “mutual” friends. 

He has never helped me with our son but gets mad when I bring that up. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells when I ask him to watch his son while I go to the store or go to work

93,ca91nw,bluesconfused,I (20M) am expected to break up with my boyfriend (23M) of three years because my older sister (22F) doesn't like him.,"I'm going to provide some context to how perhaps my family may see my boyfriend and I's situation so maybe you guys can help out so here goes; Four years ago I met him on the internet on a different social media app and were really good friends for about two of those years before we decided to try out the whole relationship thing and for us it's worked out very well, we don't really argue because if either of us has a problem with something the other is doing we'll say and we'll talk about it until we can find a solution or middle ground, we have a lot in common and I genuinely enjoyed his company and my sister was happy for me. 

Unfortunately my boyfriend's home life isn't the best and he had been planning to move somewhere closer to me for a while and so like the smart (or stupid) person I am I offered for him to come stay with me for two weeks so he could get a break and so we could actually meet, I told my sister who also lives with me and she seemed fine with it. 

So he comes up and stays for a while, we all seem to be having a good time from what I can see, the only thing that bothered me is that my boyfriend took 'Hey I'm off for two weeks on holiday so you can come up for a while.' to mean 'You can stay the entire duration of my holidays until I need to go back to work.' But that was miscommunication on my part. The time comes for him to go home and because I'm working I ask my sister if she can take him to the train station so he doesn't get lost and she's okay with that and takes him home and I thought our first encounter went well until I got home that night and my sister sits me down and tells me that she doesn't get good feelings from him and is concerned for my safety, she told me that when she was at her work she was worried for my safety because something just seemed off to her to which I agreed because he was different to what I expected but doesn't everyone on the internet come across different irl? So I thought nothing of it. Then she told me that she thought he was going to hurt me when she was out and it got to the point where she would purposefully leave work early to make sure I was okay and would disappear into her room afterwards. 

Here's the dilemma, because I said that I understood what she meant when she said she felt like something was off with him, she took that to mean 'Oh thank god you noticed it too.' and said I should break up with him. I said I'd talk to him about it but I haven't because I have no idea to approach this situation. I myself haven't had the best home life with one of my parents which has lead my mind to a dark place but with the help of my boyfriend I've gotten better because whenever I would have days where I just wouldn't want to get out of bed or do anything my family and my sister would just tell me to act my age and pull myself together.

What makes it worse is all she tells me is that she doesn't get a good feeling from him and that apparently one night when I went to bed early because I wasn't feeling well, she went to bed soon after and he followed her upstairs and said 'You don't need to run away from me.' This supposedly happened roughly 15 minutes after I dismissed myself and I don't remember hearing him come upstairs but I remember hearing her come upstairs, I don't know if I fell asleep by the time he came up and said this or my sister was lying. 

I'm making a post here because I just want to know what other people think, I don't really have friends irl and every friend I have via the internet knows him and is friends with him too. 

My boyfriend even met my dad and my dad said he thought he was a nice person, a little bit odd but he isn't sure if there is anything wrong with him.

So what should I do? Any advice for a confused 20 idiot?",2019-07-07 17:00:55,1,2,relationship_advice

Special thanks to these three users: u/keyboardstatic u/naiadofthesea u/iamlostofusernames

So, a lot happened this morning.

Tldr: We broke up on good terms.

So theres some backstory that I left out of the first post: one week ago I lost my job over some bs(she had a flat tire and I talked to managers and they were fine with me going to help her but it took longer than expected and I got fired while I was on my way to work).
I suck at cleaning and a few other things
We hadn't had sex in 2 months(she gets very Ll in highstress)
This is my first real relationship
We'd been together just under a year(3 days shy)
There was some other stuff I could put here but it's mostly irrelevant.

This morning we had a small argument about me finding a new job, I've been putting in applications but not as many as I should have(she was right on that) after that died down a little she went outside for a cigarette and after I second I followed and asked her to talk. We talked about everything we were feeling and tears were shed by the bucket loads. We ended up deciding that we both needed to work on ourselves and that neither of us were necessarily at fault, we got shoved into a really shitty situation and we tried our damndest to make the best of it, but it ain't easy. We live together with roommates(who are great, one of them has been smoking me out and trying to cheer me up all day) and we had just paid rent, so we agreed that without question I could still stay here the month and a bit longer of need be(I have a last resort here, she doesn't). We plan on staying good friends(although I may need some time first) because we really do love each other and and love to be around each other. Later this month we plan on hanging out with her brother and another friend that we haven't seen in a long time at least one more time. I love her to death and this is hard, but it's necessary. I need to fix myself and she needs to fix herself. It's gonna be hard but I know I can do it, because even if we aren't together I know that she still believes in me and will be there if I need her.

I'm sorry if this is poorly worded or anything like that, I'm still kind of a mess, most of this happened about 2 hours ago.

97,ca7ijd,kidcuisineslut,"My (25F) husband (26M) is bisexual and into cross dressing, and it’s causing issues in our marriage. I need advice.","TL;DR: Husband is bisexual and in the closet, and it’s causing issues in our marriage. 

My husband and I have been together for five years, married for almost one. He is absolutely my soulmate and we have such an amazing life together. 

Early on in our relationship, I expressed to him that I discovered I’m bisexual. He was very supportive, encouraging and accepting. We had an agreement that I would date women as long as I communicated with him. I was fine with that, and even excited to share the details. That was a while back, and I don’t really explore much now because I’m busy. But let’s get back to the real subject here...

One day, about two years ago, I noticed that my lingerie was in an odd place. Stuffed in a different drawer than usual. I didn’t really think much of it and went about my day. Later, I saw that same lingerie on none other than Reddit... my husband posing in them, his face not shown. I was shocked. The shock turned into “why didn’t he talk to me?” I confronted him gently, telling him I knew. He turned away in shame and was very quiet about it. I told him I wasn’t grossed out, only a little irritated that he stretched out a nice pair of tights. I told him I’d get him his own, and I’d help him with photo shoots if he wanted to. He seemed relieved about my support, but I could tell he was extremely uncomfortable. We talked about it here and there, but eventually it kind of just fell away. 

He then came to the conclusion that he was interested in men. From past conversations, I knew he’d explored with men in the past but said he didn’t really enjoy himself. I was supportive of him coming to terms with it and encouraged him to explore. He did go out on a few dates with one guy during this time, but he did not enjoy himself. His pursuit of men became strictly online on Grindr. It took me a while to get past the nagging insecurities like “am I not enough?” and I told myself sexuality is a complicated thing. 

Here’s where we have issues. He’s not very communicative about it. He doesn’t really tell me if he’s talking to a guy, and I’d told him before that I’d like open and transparent communication when he’s exploring, even if it’s just online. He is very closed off and feels like I’m going to judge him or see him in a different light. 

About six months ago, he told me he wanted an online boyfriend. I was happy for him and reminded him he needs to be more communicative about it. He said he wasn’t actively looking right now, but he’d let me know when he decided to pursue it. That was a fib.

Fast forward to yesterday. I’m cooking dinner in the next room, and as I walk towards him in the living room, he quickly closes out his browser and acts like he was on something else. I confront him, he tells me he’s been on this website called BDSM RL or something since Tumblr’s porn policy changed (note this was MONTHS ago). I turn around back to the kitchen, because I’m upset that he’d keep quiet about this for months. Here are some lies that come up in the conversation:  “I haven’t been sharing photos of myself on there,” “I chat with people but it’s casual,” “They say hey and I say hey back and that’s it.” At this point, I’m not aware it’s only men he’s talking to, and my brain switches into “he’s cheating.” I tell him giving someone else your flirty attention other than your spouse, even if it’s innocent at first, is a form of cheating. He clearly doesn’t get it and this turns into a heated argument.

In the middle of it, i ask for his phone. His hands are shaking. I ask him to show me the messages. He’s talking to only men, several of them, and he shared photos of himself in lingerie. I’m livid, not because of his sexuality, but because he lied to my face and kept a secret from me. We start arguing again, eventually I leave the kitchen to cry in the bedroom. 

He tells me he’s disgusted with himself, that he hasn’t come to terms with it, that he hates that side of himself. He starts to cry with his face in his hands. He says the urge to explore comes and goes, and he thought I’d given him the go ahead six months ago. I did, but I reminded him that he wasn’t open throughout these past few months, and he needs to remind me what’s going on, because honestly I forgot. We have a very long discussion about his sexuality. He is sobbing and saying he thinks he’s disgusting and gross and telling me that he’s so afraid I’ll judge him. He says he hates that side of him, that he fights the urges a lot and he just can’t accept it. 

I tell him I know it’s something he struggles with, and in order to be happy he has to confront it... but it’s hard to have sympathy when he lied to me for months. The heat dies down and we’re just talking about things. I tell him that if he continues to lie and keep secrets, this marriage will fall apart, because I have trust issues and I absolutely cannot support him if he’s secretive. He says he just doesn’t know how to bring it up. We come up with a code word to implicate whether he’s actively exploring or not. 

We go on a date and have a blast, but my heart sinks. This man is the love of my life, my best friend, but I just have a feeling he’s going to struggle with being truthful for the rest of our lives, and it will be a constant battle. I suggested he see a therapist and come to terms with everything, because if not he’ll just ruin himself and our relationship. I tell him I can be supportive and loving and helpful, but that it’s up to him to use that properly, not take advantage of me. I can only do so much. It’s up to him to be truthful and work out his issues.

I’m so sorry for the novel. I want to be supportive but it’s so difficult when he lied... 

Does anyone have any advice for me? How can I help him come to terms? Do you think our marriage is just doomed?",2019-07-07 14:39:42,21,3,relationship_advice
98,ca8uvu,vampiregrose,Do I (25F) deserve an apology from my bf (28M) for his behavior???,"So my bf of a few months and I went to a 4th of July party on Thursday where he got super drunk with a friend I don't like, since the friend has disrespected our relationship in the past. It's the first time I've seen my bf that drunk, and it embarrassed me. He's not a nasty drunk, thankfully, but he can get loud and obnoxious and doesn't know when to stop drinking once he's at a certain point. He also showed little concern for my safety and feelings, and I started to feel less like his gf and more like another body in the crowd to him. Even when we did run into each other and hug and kiss, he seemed more concerned about his shitty friend's whereabouts. Obviously, I wanted him to have fun since he's been under a lot of stress, but he had several other friends there he could've hung out with who I like and approve of. Plus, I feel like it's a bf's job to make his gf feel safe and comfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

When I finally got him away from the party, we argued on the drive back to his place because he wanted to stay longer but I didn't and knew he had to work early the next morning. He threw up and passed out, so I left without waking him to tell him. I texted him Saturday wishing him a good day and he only texted me with ""Thanks hope you have a good weekend as well."" No apology or anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite his drunken behavior, he's a great bf to me when sober, so I've made a decision to not go to any more parties or places with him where I feel like he'll behave the same way and be around bad influences. Suffice to say, I'm still annoyed he hasn't apologized for his behavior. I plan to bring these issues and my feelings up calmly and at an appropriate time in the future. Any advise/opinions on the matter??

&amp;#x200B;

**BEFORE COMMENTING**!! *Don't* advise me to break up with him. That's not why I posted this. Obviously, if I knew to, I would've done so already. I'm willing to give him a second chance.",2019-07-07 16:44:28,7,2,relationship_advice
99,ca8swj,m4l102,My parents found out I've been dating a girl and are forcing me to break up with her because they want me to focus on studying. What do I do?,"Throwaway account cause my parents check my regular account.

&amp;#x200B;

About two months ago I(15M) started dating a girl(15F) and everything was great, until my parents found out about it. Someone from my school apparently told my dad at the private school he works at. My parents are big on me not dating until around the end of high school so I only focus on studying, so my dad and mom confronted me with no warning that night(about 2 days ago). I denied it at first, then they took my phone and read all of my messages with her without my permission. They then forced me to break up with her over text while they told me exactly what to wright. They made me delete most social media, and constantly monitor my dms on the ones I do still have. I'm not allowed to go out with my friends anymore cause a few times I said to them that I was going out with my friends, but actually went on a date with her. They cut my hair which doesn't seem major but my curly long hair was probably my one good trait lmao. I really like this girl and I don't want things to end with her. My older brother(17) will now check on me at school(summer school right now) to make sure that I am not hanging out with her. The only time I would really be able to talk to her would be if we have a course together next semester. I don't want to lose her; she is amazing lol. But I have no idea what to do. So far I haven't even had the chance to tell her what's been going on and she is not handling it well according to some of our mutual friends. What should I do? Should I stay with her? If I do how could I make a relationship work with my parents helicoptering over me? Anything helps I just need someone to point me in the right direction.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

TDLR my parents broke up my first relationship with a girl that I really like as soon as they found out to make me focus more on studies.

Also, it's not like I'm that bad a student. My total average among all courses in high school so far is a 93.",2019-07-07 16:39:24,5,2,relationship_advice
100,ca8ss1,VorTex567,I (29M) worry I am falling out of love with my GF (27F). It isn't her fault and I feel so lost. (X-post from r/relationships),"I apologize if this turns into more of a venting rant than actually asking for advice. I am feeling really messed up and honestly worry I have no idea what I'm actually feeling. Part of this is to try and get my thoughts in writing for the first time to see if I can figure things out. I'm also typing this on mobile while on vacation camping with my GF, so I apologize for spelling/grammar errors and if my thoughts end up a bit disjointed. I also acknowledge that I am 100% the one in the wrong and at fault here. 

My GF and I met in a bit of a weird way, but we quickly bonded and were casually seeing each other for about 4 months before we decided to make it official and we have been together pretty solidly until now. We almost never have any fights, and disagreements between us are always handled very well, we both are good at handling criticism (for the most part) and we both now how to approach the other in order to calmly have a discussion about our issues. I would argue that our relationship is pretty much the gold standard of what a successful relationship should look like, and that is why I am so worried about my feelings.

My GF I feel like has always been so affectionate and is so loving towards me. She regularly tells me how I am the best thing in her life, and I have been this stable rock of support for her and she doesn't know what she would do without me. She tells me she loves me all the time, and I know 100% she means it. I love her too, very much, I care for her a great deal and I just want everything to be okay for her even if I am unsure if I am still ""in love"", but I just feel like she loves me and needs me so much more than I have ever given her even at our best, and I feel like that is so unfair to her to think and feel this way when she has been damn near perfect.

One area that has somewhat consistently been an issue for us is sexual chemistry, at least from my perspective. My GF has a very high libido, and pretty much constantly craves sex. This should be great on paper, I'm a guy and sex is great, but I just feel like her sexual desires are so much stronger than mine I'm worried that I can't fulfill her longer term. The past couple years we sometimes go a couple weeks without having sex. And when we do have sex it is always kinda the same. She isn't an outwardly demanding lover, but I do feel like she can be selfish in the bedroom. I sometimes feel like our sessions of intimacy are about getting her off and I finish while that happens, if that makes sense? Sex is honestly pretty good, although a little bland. We usually cum together, and I feel like I have her sexually figured out pretty well. Ah, that's something else; we have been together 7 years, and I still don't feel like she knows how to really turn me on, like she doesn't know the right spots on my body to touch and when, she doesn't really do anything about the kinks she knows I am into (for example, I am admittedly a bit of a foot fetish guy, GF says she has a bit of a foot fetish too, but does basically nothing to incorporate it into our sex life unless I push for it). Despite this, she has never made me feel judged and has always been accepting of the things I have told her I am into, and part of me fears losing that too.

Lately, i just feel so guilty. I feel guilty that i feel this way, because she doesn't deserve for me to have doubts when she has been so wonderful. Our lives are so involved with each other, disentangling them and moving on just seems so daunting. I'm not worried about me, I will make it through anything, I can't stand the thought of just ""abandoning"" her when this whole thing is coming from me. I feel guilty about the timing of all this too. Her father was recently diagnosed with cancer, and while he is doing very well and will almost certainly beat it, this is pretty much the worst timing for me to be questioning our relationship. We both moved in with her parents several months ago to help take care of things while they battle with cancer. I can't leave them now, it would be one of the most heartless things ever, but the guilt of feeling like I am lying to my GF is eating away at me. I mean so much to her, I know she would be completely devastated if I left.

What I am most scared of is myself. What if this is just depression talking, and I am sabotaging my own relationship because I feel bad. Do I actually feel like we are drifting apart, or is the guilt of me thinking that way driving a wedge between us? 

Well, that was certainly a wall of text. If anyone can decipher that and is feeling kind enough to send some words my way, I would appreciate it. I know I didn't get everything out and there are huge gaps of info missing, but I'm just really desperate to try something. One step at a time.

TL;DR
I think I am drifting apart from my GF of 7 years. she is great and very loving, but we haven't matched sexually for a long time, and I feel like she loves me so much more than I can offer her that I feel guilty about being with her. The guilt is tearing me up, and I don't even know if my feeling are legit or if I am making mountains out of molehills because I am just spiraling and letting unwarranted guilt get to me.",2019-07-07 16:39:07,2,1,relationship_advice

104,ca6ebj,everything_is_korean,What should I do when my white FIL makes mildly racist comments to me?,"We visit my in laws once a year. My father in law is older and sometimes kind of out of it due to heavy pain medication. However each time we visit he says something to me that is well, not that cool.  

Background: I am Korean but adopted, so my culture is that of most Midwest Americans. I'm also the only non-white person in the entire family, counting all generations. I've been married to my husband for 10 years and we have two kids.

This year, there were two instances:

1) He was eating rice pudding, offered me some, I declined, then he asked if my son had had enough rice for the day.  I was like ??? and he said, you know, remember how when he was a baby you were so worried about making sure he ate enough rice every day.

a) I never said that about my son. In fact, that was a story told to him by my husband about 15 years ago about a college friend whose Chinese mom would sometimes call to see if he was eating enough.  

b) There were about 5 family members around when that happened and no one said anything. I had to just sort of awkwardly say that I didn't remember saying that.

2) The next day, we were sitting down for a big family dinner with 11 of us at the table.  There was a salad and multiple dressing options on the table.  I asked my FIL to pass me the one nearest him because it looked like balsamic.  He passes it to me and sees that it is called Asian sesame ginger dressing.  He asks me ""is this some sort of bias, is that why you want this one?""  Again, I just awkwardly say that I just picked one.

a) The table conversation was pretty loud and chaotic trying to feed kids and attempt adult conversation at the same time. Still, if anyone heard what he said to me, no one said anything.

So I don't know.  I don't like the things he says, and it's weird to me because even though I look asian and I am asian, I was adopted and raised by white people so it still takes me off guard when people make asian comments to me.  

I don't want him to say these things to me. I don't want to say anything to him because he's in poor health and also EXTREMELY sensitive to anything that could be considered close to criticism.  For instance, one time he was in a galley kitchen just standing around while we were trying to make dinner and we asked him to make room for us, and he cried.

What would you all do? Just continue to let it slide? Wait for his poor health to take it's toll? I can't think of a way to put an end to these comments without hurting feelings or creating some weird rift when we only see them once a year anyway. 

Also fun side note, the FIL used to call me a bitch every once in a while because he seemed to think it was funny somehow.  He hasn't done it in a while, but the last time he called me a bitch was because I had complained that I got 15+ mosquito bites on my face during vacation.

106,ca77n4,grayparrot116,23 (M) trapped in a really difficult family situation.,"Hi, I'm a 23-year-old male from Spain and I'm writing this post because I'm seeking advice on what to do with my family. Currently I am back at my parents house, since I finished university and I was starting to miss spending time with them (I went back home every weekend during university, but I already got to that part where you understand that your parents are not eternal and you want to spend as much time with them as you possibly can). I'm trying to get a job while I finish my dissertation, so I can move out and have independence.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister (29) lives with her boyfriend (49) and her baby (2) in my hometown, not so far away from my parents' house. She has always bullied me: she stabbed me in the leg with a pair of scissors when I was 3, she burned my hair, she took photos of me in my underwear when I was a kid, she hit me almost every week, she blackmailed me and made me make her sandwiches, and now, even if she is a grown-up adult, she still employs cynicism as her weapon of choice when trying to attack me. To her, I've always been the favored one, which is kind of true, I cannot deny it. She also attacks my parents, fights them, insults them and laughs at them many times and also, blames them for some of her problems. These are some of the reasons why I don't want to be around her, to the point I want to sever ties with her.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why I decided to write this post and seek advice has been the situation I've been living with my family lately: both my parents and my sister work together at my parents' house and kindergarten is over in the afternoons. As there is no kindergarten, my nephew has to stay here almost every afternoon, and disturbs my parents and my sister when they are working; this means, that according to my sisters is my obligation, as someone who according to her and my parents ""does nothing"" to babysit her son for free because and also pick him up from school, as ""my parents are the ones that earn the money, maintain me and feed me""; I refuse, because my nephew is somehow ""hyperactive"" and behaves very badly, and I have little patience with him, they say I'm selfish. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last week my mother injured her arm and has tendinitis, so she cannot work: now only my sister and father work, so my sister and her child have to stay at my parents' house and eat lunch here; this, of course, means that I have to stand her usual cynicism and her puns, and my mother expects me to stay quiet and give her no answer. According to my parents and my sister, this is still her house, even if she moved out, the only things she does is eat and drink stuff for free, use my father's car and not tidy anything that she and her child messes; this kind of makes me mad, and in the end she ended up calling me a mooch, and I did the same thing; she got mad, pushed the table we were eating against me and stormed off crying. While my mother was comforting my sister, she said that I was the only one that shouldn't be at my house. So as my father arrived home, I left and went away to let my mind clear and not be mad at anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

From there, things have gone worst, my father saying he is sick of my attitude and my sister always trying to get my parents' to be mad at me with her ways.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? (please don't say ""move out"", I already know I have to do that) Thanks for your time.",2019-07-07 14:10:11,5,3,relationship_advice
107,ca8lqk,WhenInLA,Texting Opposite Sex in Marriage,"Backstory: My husband has a female friend he has been friends with since early school days. A long time. He would consider her a best friend, even like a sister from his own words. I have spent time with each of his close friends, except her, which I find strange for someone who is like a sister to you. I asked throughout the entire time we dated to arrange some sort of dinner or outing where I could get to know her without anything being arranged. Both he and this friend are married. He and I newly married, her for a little longer with small children. 

Regardless, he and this friend text all throughout the day, every single day. I told him before we were married that I would like the friendship to evolve into one that was more suitable for a married man - couple dates, me getting to know her, etc., rather than constantly texting. I let him know, intentionally before we were married, that while I understand this type of situation might be okay for some people, the constant texting wouldn’t be something I’d find appropriate for my husband and another woman. He agreed the texting would stop and my feelings mattered more to him than anything. I was so happy he was so understanding and thought his response was perfect. 

Fast forward to today. The texting has not slowed down even a little. I find they text throughout each and every single day, all day. While none of the texts contain any real in depth, deep conversation, they are so constant. I do believe my husband loves me. But, I am very hurt that the texting hasn’t even come close to stopping and I feel she is more important to him than protecting my feelings and respecting how I feel around this matter. I don’t want him to never speak to her again, I only feel things should evolve to an appropriate friendship with a married man. I don’t even text my very best friends as much as they text each other, and I too have very close friends that I consider more like sisters.

I do understand some people would have no problem with their husband having such a close female friend that their husband contacts so frequently, and to each their own. But I feel since I made it clear before we were married that I wasn’t comfortable with that type of arrangement in my own marriage, I deserve to have my feelings respected. I love my husband. I don’t want to be controlling and I don’t want this to drive a wedge between us. There are other women he texts from time to time to check in on for various reason and I have no problem with that. I don’t personally believe this is a jealousy thing as I’m not that type of person. I’m just hurt and not sure how to handle it from here.",2019-07-07 16:21:21,10,2,relationship_advice

He said I was ""moving too freely"" (I have no idea what that is even supposed to mean?) and someone would get mad at me cutting the line. My bf even knows how the flash pass operates as well, it's not like he was unaware. No one had an issue. The people waiting on the line didn't, the ride people didn't, everyone was totally fine except him.

After we get off the ride he says to me ""I know why that lady hit you now"". And this is when I lost it. I am ashamed and embarrassed, but after he said that I got so upset that I threw my water bottle down in the middle of the park in the midst of onlookers and I walked off. Back in fall of 2018 a random mentally unstable woman ran up to me out of no where and assaulted me. She hit me hard while I was on my way in to my office. She struck close to my face but mostly hit my neck/shoulder area as I had jerked my face away in reaction when I saw her about to attack me. I do not know who that woman was, she just randomly attacked me on the street. This is the situation my bf was referring to and VALIDATING that he now knows why some random lady on the street attacked me....because I ""move freely"" when I have a freaking flash pass in six flags???? I couldn't take it. To justify me getting assaulted because I was walking to a ride in the park? I couldn't take the stupidity in his logic. He often says very stupid things to me like this that make no sense and he likes to throw past situations in my face a lot. I feel like I'm always doing something wrong that aggravates him and I don't understand it? This has happened so many times. He gets upset at me for something small, we end up bickering and arguing about it and he tells me he will work on himself and do better only to turn around and behave the exact same way days later. I'm so freaking tired of it all. There is a level of bickering in every relationship I think, but is this an unhealthy level?",2019-07-07 09:29:41,18,7,relationship_advice
110,ca5rzt,andre3stax,Am I (25M) being stupid or is she (31F) actually hiding something?," 

We been dating very seriously for almost 2 years. Even discussed marriage when I'm done with med school. Shes been a very kind, generous, trustworthy person. We currently don't live in the same state anymore and we're both rather busy so we maybe see each other for 1-2weeks every 3 months or so. I was at her place 2 weeks ago and we usually lose our snapchat streaks when we're together because we get too into the moment. Before I go into what transpired, I've been cheated on by my ex of 4 years and i found out because she gave me a std. So my current gf knows i have a bit of trust issue. She's been cheated on as well in the past. So she's always been saying, ""i can forgive you for everything except cheating"" Anyways...  


One night, I said to her ""babe you have to open my snap"" and reached over to her phone which was right next to me. She was few feet away. I reached over, unlocked her phone, and opened the app. Right before I could open the snap I sent, I saw that she had an unopened snap from a dude and a brand new 3 day streak with him. She snatched the phone away (or that's what it felt like) and opened the snap i sent her. I asked her who he was. She told me it was one of her ex-students (she's a relatively new college English101 prof and she adds some of them on snap/ig after semester ends). I later did some research and he is a 21yo who attends that college. She never mentioned him to me even though we're pretty transparent about these things. We tell each other where we're going, with who, etc. It started because she would want me to tell her everything so i came to expect the same from her.   


I felt a little suspicious/insecure at this point and eventually asked if i can see her other msging apps like imessage and ig. I didnt ask her to open that snap in front of me. I'm just realizing this now idk why. It seemed like she was stalling for 5-10 seconds and i glanced at her deleting her messages because i was sitting on the bed and she sitting on the ground. She proceeded to show me and say, ""see, nothing"" I confronted her about it and we sort of got into it. She was basically saying that she didnt want this to turn into a fight because i might get mad when it was ""nothing"". Maybe that's the case... but she straight up lied to my face. Even saying ""would i look you in the eyes and lie?"" before I disclosed the fact that i saw her. It turned into a fight and eventually I changed my flight to later that night and came home. We're now in this weird place... we briefly talked here and there after. She was getting super stressed with this happening on top of other stuff shes been dealing with lately thats irrelevant to this story. So she told me ""let's not talk for a bit and maybe if we still feel like working things out, let's talk when youre done with your exam"". I have a HUGE med school board exam in 2 weeks. What do you think?   


TL;DR I caught my gf lie to me about something potentially small and confronted her. Now we're on a break. Should i try to work things out or is she just another liar thats going to hurt me?",2019-07-07 11:17:17,19,3,relationship_advice

113,ca8h09,krisnarocks,Girlfriend of 1 year won’t allow me to leave even after her breaking up references,"Currently doing long distance with my girlfriend. The first 3 months was okay. Then it went awkward. Felt distant from her. Since 2 months ago, I felt that she no longer love me. Confronted her, she then told me that she doesn’t love me as much as she used to but still have feelings. So I tried to ask her whats up. Got an answer. Then I would fix the problem. The thing is, since I started fixing this relationship, she doesn’t seems to change.

After all that, I feel that this is the end. So I tried to tell her that theres nothing I can do and I’m just gonna let this feelings die on its own and go on our separate way. She said “No. I may not love you as much as I used to, but I still love you”. So I tried again. Same response from her. This time I found out that shes been talking trash about me behind my back. Told her that this is the end. We would than facetime and she said that “I don’t wanna breakup. I don’t wanna hurt you” she also said that “I don’t want you to go back drinking and partying. Im afraid that if we breakup you’ll end up there” and told me to talk about this next time.

Fast forward to yesterday. Told me that “I don’t really see any hope with our relationship”. I would then ask her why she thought about it that way. She would then change the topic to something else. Today, she told me that shes also trying to fix this relationship and that I shouldn’t give-up on it just yet.

3 times I asked for a breakup (I told her once, subtly when she ask me why Im acting weird,  that if I cant fix this problem, I’ll let the relationship die on its own). 3 times she declined. It gave me false hope and broke me even more.

I don’t know if she actually cared for me or she cared for me so that she can get the attention since she said that she cared a lot for me but the don’t love me. I don’t know if she’s seeing other guys.

Im not sure what to do. Should I keep on trying to fix this relationship now that shes also trying to fix it? Should I ghost her? Should I slowly remove my feelings for her?

I need your opinions. Thank you

116,ca8fib,Throwaway772019Heyy,Discovered my [27/f) fiancé (31/m) looks at the subreddit “LegalTeen”,"Yesterday when my partner was looking up something unrelated on his phone while I looked on, and the subreddit popped up. I am skeaved out by this and potentially concerned. I am pretty unconcerned about him watching porn in general (Our sex life is good, and he doesn’t do it to any degree that his watching has ever registered with me previously), but am concerned that he would subscribe to a page specifically focused on teens. He shared with me he primarily uses reddit to view porn, and that was the only subreddit of that “type” he was subscribed to, of the five or so porn-related ones. He doesn’t comment or send messages...he allowed me to check. Having discussed it with him, I understand that much of the content features women who are clearly not teens, but I still have the following concerns:


1. I don’t feel Reddit can do a thorough enough job getting the content to avoid anything illegal slipping through, and being viewed.

2. The “teen” label squicks me out. Honestly, a lot of the same content marketed differently (and I’m sure it could be) wouldn’t bother me but to specifically seek it out when it’s labeled “teen” gives me icky feelings.


3. This is more of a trust issue. Due to the fact that he does clear his browser history (to avoid things popping up exactly as they did), I can’t verify that what he tells me about what he gravitates to is the truth. From what I could see (with his permission), there was nothing that I found very concerning in his recent porn choices, but it was a limited sample.


To be clear, also...this is not a jealously thing. He also followed a subreddit called eraser nipples and I have inverted nipples...and I have zero problems with that. He also has told me that he understands my concerns, he apologized, unsubscribed from that Reddit, and said he’ll avoid things marketed that way in the future. 


I do think, however, that it doesn’t help that this discovery corresponded with his teenage sister’s visit. I have never seen anything remotely inappropriate in his relationship with anyone (he’s awkward about touching/affection with anyone but me), but it definitely rose my panic level. When I brought that up, it didn’t seem like it had crossed his mind and he’d just accessed it when he typically does (occasionally in the bathroom in the morning).


Any thoughts on this would be appreciated!",2019-07-07 16:05:41,5,2,relationship_advice

118,ca8dox,put_your_drinks_down,My [33F] boyfriend [33M] doesn't want to commit because I'm emotionally unstable - but also doesn't want to break up,"I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years. We live and work together in a foreign country, but we are both American. I really love him and could see myself with him in the long-term. However, he has doubts about our relationship because of work-related anxiety I've had during our relationship.

Our work is very stressful. However, my bosses have made it worse several times in the last 5 years by making me cover for the open roles of people who quit. It takes a very long time to hire because the country is a bit dangerous, so I have covered 2-5 different demanding jobs at the same time for months or years at a time. This has been very difficult for me and has led to panic attacks, depression, and burn out.

As a result I have screamed at and cried in front of my boyfriend many times and started big fights. I have also lost my temper with friends and strangers. To be clear, I'm not proud of this AT ALL. I have started going to therapy to try to deal better with my anxiety under pressure. I've asked my bosses many times to reduce my workload and they refuse, for various reasons that I won't get into, but are bullshit and very frustrating. I would have of course left this job a long time ago, but I stayed so me and my bf could be together.

My boyfriend, who has a similar job to me, has had a normal, healthy workload for nearly all this time, so he can't really understand what it feels like. It's also worth noting that my boyfriend could have volunteered to take some of my workload from me throughout this 5 years, but has not for the most part (though he's helped with a few things, especially recently).

My boyfriend is really disappointed by how I've handled this stress. A few weeks ago, we talked about the future of the relationship, and he said he's not sure he wants to be with me long-term because I don't handle stress in a healthy way. Life is full of stress, and he's worried I'll yell at our children or have a breakdown. He says that maybe he would change his mind if I proved I could handle things better, but he's not sure how long it would take to change his mind and if it will even be possible. However, he wants to continue the relationship and see how things go.

I told him that I wanted to end the relationship. On my side, I feel like I've been trying really hard to improve myself and get through this difficult situation, through therapy and making changes to the way I work. I feel like I've learned an enormous amount. However, recovering from burnout and filling 4 jobs at the same time, like I'm doing now, is hard and it's going to take time. He doesn't ""count"" or notice the improvements I think I've made recently, nor does he think the things I've been working on in therapy have paid off.

I love him and want to put in the effort to make this relationship work. But I'm worried that no matter how much I improve, he'll always see me as unstable. Frankly, I'm old, and I want to find a life partner - I don't want to waste time on someone who will never see me as good enough. I don't blame him for this. I just want out of this relationship so I can start fresh with someone new and do better next time.

The problem is he's really upset about me leaving. He says I'm dooming the relationship because of my pessimism, and that maybe things would work out if I could make improvements. He's told me that I'm turning myself into a victim and I'll never be happy because I always blame other people for my problems. But I don't blame him. I think his stance is completely reasonable. I'm just worried that he's never going to be convinced, and so there's no point in continuing.

I'm not sure what to do. Should I leave, or keep working on the relationship? Am I making a rational decision here, or is he right that I'm running away instead of fixing this?

TL;DR: I'm concerned that my boyfriend will never commit to our relationship because he sees me as emotionally unstable, but he doesn't want to break up. What should I do?",2019-07-07 16:01:17,6,2,relationship_advice

120,ca8coy,Attempt101,"Sexless relationship and HUGE, deformed boobs","I have been with my boyfriend for about a year and a half. We live and work together--essentially spending 24/7 together. Our relationship is an emotional rollercoaster. 

At this point in time, we have been in an almost sexless relationship for the last 8 months--having sex only twice and giving him oral sex less than a handful of times. The problem is that he is legitimately into MASSIVE breasts-- i don't mean double Ds...he himself has admitted HH size breasts are not too big and he prefers them bigger.  Imo, the more deformed they look, the bigger a turn-on for him. 

I am about 5' 5"" and generally a petite/smaller girl. Since i have been with him, I've intentionally packed on the pounds so i can fit his ideal of what he finds desirable. No matter what, I'm still a small/slender girl and can't get past a D cup. I know the idea of me changing myself for a man is pitiful, but I'm just being 100% honest. I've even considered getting a boob job, but i know that regardless of how big i go, it will never be enough for him. 

In the beginning of our relationship, we couldn't keep our hands off each other. There was never a day or circumstance that could prevent us from being intimate. Last August, i noticed distance (that he denied) and our sex life decreased to once a week. We talked about how we shouldn't let it go so long, but reality was that he was cheating on me, but only online (examples: hitting up exes talking about meeting up and how much he missed fucking them, hitting up someone on Tinder and sending dick pics and sexually explicit messages, asking women to meet up with him, though I'm pretty confident it never made it that far, etc.).  I found out all of these things on my own and it destroyed me. Currently, when he has any sexual desire, he excuses himself to take a shower or go to the bathroom so he can look up porn. The one thing that all of these women have in common is the fact that they are thick, chubby or fat (depending on which woman we are talking about) and they all have substantially bigger breasts than me. 

I have tried calmly talking, yelling, crying, etc. to try to explain to him how all of this makes me feel. Nothing works. His newest thing is saying that the reason he doesn't want to be intimate with me is because it is an issue and that's too much pressure. Before, his reasoning was that he was just going through some stuff. He claims he is in love with me and attracted to me, but i feel like his actions indicate otherwise because someone who really felt that way wouldn't naturally have a sexless relationship for as long as this has gone on. During vicious fights, he says the hurtful things i believe are truth. 

At this point in time, I don't know what to do. I love him and i am very much in love with him, but this is also incredibly painful. I am not used to feeling this way and don't know how to simply ""move past it"" anymore. Unfortunately, because we live and work together it is impossible to make a clean break and a huge part of me doesn't want to anyway. I want back what was in the beginning and he claims he still very much feels the same way about me, but other stresses we are working on (finances and other outside stressors) are the real culprit and things will get better soon. So, what do i do?",2019-07-07 15:58:48,19,2,relationship_advice
121,ca58ry,naughtyboy7799,My (18m) relationship with my insecure girlfriend (17f).,"So a bit about how it began.
She texted me on snapchat 【about two months ago now 】( she got my snap user from my ig bio ) ""hey"" and some random stuff.  I replied and asked if i knew her to which she replied no and introduced herself. (She was in the same school as me). So we started talking and exchanged phone numbers. 

After a few days, we met, and it was beautiful. Yeah, she's gorgeous. We didn't get awkward at all. She even asked me for a hug before she left.

By this time i had already started feeling something for her but i didn't want to rush anything. She also used to leave a text for me almost everyday. Long ass text about how lucky she is to have me and how I'm an amazing person. I used to reply in a similar way. ( I'm just a kind person more academically inclined so i don't have a big friend circle. So when anyone texts me, I try my best to be helpful)


Everything happened over a month.


Next time we met, we went to my bed and she suggested we should cuddle cause she's tired from school. I felt happy and agreed. She kissed my cheek and when i turned, she planted one straight on my lips then proceed to bury her head in my chest. Now i was pretty sure she's into me.

She had a crappy childhood, her dad ( he died ) used to beat the hell outta her mom. And everything she has seen in her life never lasted. She told me all this while i held her close. I almost started crying when she told how her alcoholic dad treated her like thrash. Believe me, she's a kind hearted beautiful girl, you don't see her type everyday.

I felt my frequency matching with hers. I asked her how is this all happening and how are you so comfortable with me, you don't even know me. To which she replied she doesn't know that herself and is surprised about it. She also told me she doesn't like touching, i.e she is a more of a handshake person rather than hugs, except for her family, and now me.


We start dating.


Next few times we made out, we would cuddle and after a lot of random stuff she would tell me how insecure she is.
I told her how much she means to me and I'll never cheat on her but she says things have never lasted for her and I'll leave her for someone else. She is also worried that I'm leaving for college next month (which is in a different city and is located in one of the prime areas of the country and has mind blowing nightlife ) and i might hook up with someone else. Believe me, she's insecure on a whole different level. I usually talk in a low tone and she starts asking what's wrong and if it's her fault. I'm like you're one of the reason i smile, dumbass ! She loves me a lot but she's way too afraid i might cheat or leave her and that she's not ""good enough"" for me. Please tell me, what should i do about this situation ?


I'm also worried because she has to study a lot to get in the college she's aiming for, but she also worries way too much about things not related to her studies. She also has severe migrane.

Our relationship was going through a rough patch (not the first one but the most serious one for sure.) and it went on unchecked on both our sides for 3 months or so. Like we knew we had problems but life was kicking us in the gut and it was hard and it was hard to see eachother. (We live separately, but we’re going to move in together when my gfs lease was up in july. Signed papers to move in together and everything.) So the little times we did see eachother no one wanted to argue we just wanted to escape from our problems and just love eachother. So we did. But it also meant problems kept piling up and being brushed under the rug. Then one day we got into an argument and I had just worked a 12 shift I was tired and I just wanted to eat my pizza I hadn’t eaten all day and she came at me when I got to her place that night and I was aggravated. We both fought really bad. Worse than we ever had. We ended up breaking up and I went home I didn’t wanna stay there. Both of us said stupid things we didn’t mean. However I went over the next morning before work becuz I wanted to talk things out calmly and not both screaming at each other and sometimes when we fought we just needed space and then one of us would come over to talk later and we could resolve things peacefully after getting some space. When I get there I see a man in her bed. Both of them hung over af. She said she didn’t sleep with him but later admitted she did. I left and we didn’t talk for a couple days. Her thing is she didn’t cheat becuz we broke up in the heat of the moment that night and she did him that morning (the fight took place at like 11pm. And I was at her house the next day at 7am.) idk how to feel about it tho. I felt betrayed that not a couple hours later someone was in her bed. She regretted it tho apparently. And we had tried to work things out afterwards. It felt very different tho. And I could feel myself getting paranoid. 
One thing to note is, she refused to cut him off afterwards cuz that was her friend. / co worker. And it made me uncomfortable. 
I told her I had lost trust and i said we needed to just take some time apart to ourselves before trying to get back together becuz we both clearly had shit we needed to work out. She didn’t want that she just wanted me back and for things to be normal but I told her I couldn’t trust her right now. And I needed time. 
She still wanted us to move in together but I also needed to think. It’s been two months now and we are still seeing each other I would like to say as friends but most times we still act like a couple. She still treats me like I’m her girlfriend and says she loves me and that she’s in love with me and wants to get back together but she’s doing a lot of things she never did in our relationship that are turning me off from her. Like always being drunk 24/7. As well as she says she loves me but she’s been on a lot of dates and she’s seeing other people sexually but she always tells me she’s just chillin and going with the flow and always tells these people she’s in love with her ex but then proceeds to sleep with them or go on dates. Boys and girls. 
My friends and brothers tell me I should cut her off. But I’ve known her since I was 12 and I care about her a lot. As a person not just a lover. 
One of my friends even set me up on a date with this one girl who I used to like in highschool. She moved but she came back and I had kept in touch with her but not like super closely. We were just friends. But she’s been there for me and she’s been treating me really good and she told me she has a crush on me. I don’t know how I feel about it. I’m not opposed to getting to know this new girl. I think my friend knew that so that’s why she set us up. My ex knows about her and she says she’s scared this new person will take me away from her. But my ex has also been distant with me this past week. It’s also July now and I’m to move in like 20 days. And I was thinking of subleasing. But idk how to bring that up. My ex has also been getting really close to a friend of mine she works with. She told me it’s just platonic. But they post about eachother publicly and I think he likes her a lot. She gets defensive when I bring it up. But I feel like I’m just here as decoration. I feel stuck.

125,ca83wb,NeedHelpPlz99,I [20 M] am the reason for my friends metal health illness [20 M],"  

 

 

Hey Guys,

I enjoy a bit of banter, taking the piss out of myself, the situation and everyone around me is a core part of my personality. The issue comes from quite a good friend of mine who is pretty much involved with the majority of my friendships circles however can be a bit sensitive and doesn't take banter very well (However loves dishing it out). Anyway, some mates (Including Him) and myself were playing some video games and we were all laughing and joking about, and I made a couple of comments about my friend that was met with laughter from everyone including him. Anyway, later I get a message from him, telling me how my negative comments were uncalled for and that his sick of my toxic behavior that always turns everyone against him. I replied by saying i didn’t say anything bad and was just taking the piss and to relax. He then responds with a message that has me most concerned. He basically straight out says that "" I actually have mental health issues myself and when I think about why I do it’s mainly u. Your insults make me think that I should just give up"". I'm immediately mortified that anyone would ever think this about me. I apologized but at the same time state state that I am unsure what the hell I have done. He basically explains that its my personality and my banter that he hates.

Im not sure whether my next play was correct but I say that if my personality is affecting you that much we should not have this close of a friendship because its clearly not healthy for you, however ill always be here if you need to talk..

He however then states that I am a great bloke 99% of the time and wants to continue being my good mate, its just the %1 with the banter that he hates and causes him mental health issues?

I don’t know what to do, I am being a asshole? Can I continue to be good friends with someone when now I know I cause them mental health issues? I have no idea what to do and would love some advice.

TL;DR: Friend states Im the reason for mental health issues after harmless banter, what do I do?",2019-07-07 15:36:09,4,2,relationship_advice
126,ca53h3,AlwaysHungrynTired,"Isn't it worse to hurt someone intentionally, than by mistake?","I said ""must be nice"" when I was talking to my friend about her mans that can cook (my significant other isn't very good at cooking) and my s.o. heard me. While I genuinely meant no harm, my s.o. confronted me that I hurt his feelings. Which I accept. I apologized to him and said I wouldn't say it like that anymore. But he was still very bothered by it and ignored me throughout the night. I often say that to a lot of things, ""wow that must be nice"" when my other friends do cute (couple) things together - as my s.o. aren't too keen on doing similar things. I accept that it's me comparing what we have in a sense, but I also don't care too much that we don't do the same things that others do. I do find it very cute when others do that stuff, but if I really wanted to do the same, I would tell him. It is not a big deal at all if we don't do it. I've never been mad about it nor mad at him.

Anyways, he is still very bothered about me ""comparing"" him to some other guy and although we talked/argued about it and moved passed it a day or two later - tonight it was brought up again while we fought about another issue. 

It's really hard to explain and i'm too lazy to go into super detail, but I really want to confirm something. 
I really really really did NOT mean to hurt his feelings by saying ""must be nice"" about my friend's guy being able to cook. But I do accept that I hurt him  and I said I wouldn't do it again. But there's been times he INTENTIONALLY said things to hurt the way I feel. For example, I asked him to bring me food and my glasses I left in his car one time and he comes at me like ""wow, the shit do for you."" But he's always saying I can rely on him for anything so I felt soo offended when he got bothered because I asked him for a small favor. I know he usually does a lot for me in general but why does he say I can rely on him if he gets upset when I do? I would be more than willing to do anything for him but if he doesn't ask me, then what does he expect? Why does he get so mad?

So my dilemma is, I understand that I hurt him but I didn't mean to (saying the ""must be nice"")...but don't you think it's worse when he actually tried to hurt my feelings by say something in a certain way? I feel like it's a different level of hurt, but he's trying to tell me it's the same shit. While I get that it both hurts me or him, it really isn't on the same level...right? 

I would never want to hurt him purposefully. But he even admitted to saying that when we fight sometimes that he wants to say shit that hurts me?

I'm not wrong for feeling that he's being harsh on me? But it really feels like he doesn't understand my way of thinking. Or maybe i'm just wrong and he's right. It doesn't matter how it comes across, if we both said something we felt hurt by then we just have to accept that it hurt each other. 

I do feel like he struggles to communicate with me sometimes and gets mad instead. But I know i'm not any better when I don't always say things in a good tone.",2019-07-07 09:36:07,5,4,relationship_advice
127,ca81xe,Zeldhuh,My boyfriend's best friend sexually assaulted me &amp; PTSD made me look like a tool afterwards,"I guess I should start this story off by explaining that my previous ex was abusive. I became conditioned to doing what he wanted to avoid him treating me badly. I was single for a good chunk of months before matching with my (ex)boyfriend on tinder in August 2017. At the beginning, I told him I wasn't ready for a relationship just yet, but we fell hard and fast. He was amazing but his friends were sketchy. I started being very on edge around his friends, befause I would read certain behaviors as aggressive when they weren't. I became the naggy bitchy girlfriend that I never was in the past. All my other exes have been the ones to later reach out and tell me they were dumb for not being willing/ trying hard enough to make it work.

There was one specific friend that always low-key flirted with me, despite having a girlfriend at the time I met him. I would constantly make jokes as a reply or just tell him straight up ""I love my BF and you love your GF"". He eventually got dumped by his girlfriend because she caught him cheating a third time. A lot of fights within my relationship were about not understanding why he kept toxic people around. Sad that he defended his friend group until it got to this point but we were staying at this friends' house after drinking one night. We'd stayed there before and it was completely fine. Bf fell asleep early, one of his friends was puking in the grass, and the two others we were chillin' with went outside to smoke. I should've just went with them but I stayed bc I was really drunk and just wanted to sit. This guy starts massaging my feet and legs and when I told him to chill, he didn't. I pulled my chair away and he pulled it closer to him. From that point forward, I was powerless. I went to the bathroom but when I came out, he cornered me in the hallway and corwded me to go in the room. Eventually, I only got out of this situation because he sat back and tried to unbuckle his belt. I leaned over and said ""you wish I would"" and I ran into the room with my sleeping boyfriend.

I dealt with a lot of guilt because I truly thought I trusted this friend. I trusted that his flirting was harmless and that he had enough respect for my boyfriend, who had been his friend since second grade. Looking back, I was lowkey groomed into trusting this friend: he got me a Christmas present but acted super nonchalant about it, he once coached me through an anxiety attack and would always defend my boyfriend to me when we were having issues. I wasn't sure if my boyfriend was the type to deny this happened or if his friend would call me insane and switch the situation on me as the bad guy. I took another month or two to admit anything happened to my boyfriend. And by that time, I already fell back into depression and was acting irritable all the time. We got into an argument because a month passed and we saw this friend twice in public settings, but nothing had been addressed yet. We decided to go on break so I could have time to heal on my own and we could rebuild our friend groups and independent identities. My bf talked to this friend and denounced him. I blocked him on all social media and was never supposed to see him again.

We spend the rest of the time in the apartment and move out. Literally, the next day is Pride and I go with scummy friend's ex-girlfriend (the one who was cheated on). We were already super drunk; I weigh &amp;gt;110lbs and we finished a bottle of vodka + had champagne. She meets up with some girl who happens to be with my assaulter. My PTSD kicked in and all of a sudden I was acting like his arm candy essentially. In that moment, I acted like I would've with my abusive ex and listened to anything my assaulter said. I didn't remember being asked to leave the area, but apparently I said no more than once. Apparently, we left the area and I came back riding piggyback on his shoulders?? Don't remember that either and I don't know whether to attribute it to dissociating or just being blacked out. I hate myself for even being cordial with him, but it makes it so much worse because I was acting coupley. With the dude who assaulted me. Who took what he wanted even when I said no. He put me on his Snapchat story and as you can imagine, the entire situation blew up.

I don't understand trauma enough to attempt to explain this well enough for my now-ex-boyfriend. He can't understand why this would make any type of sense and he's still petty about it being THAT friend specifically. ""You could've fucked anyone at Pride and I would've been fine with it."" It was like my brain shut off and I was just obeying because I felt unsafe. When my friend asked if it was fine to be around him, I said yeah because I was only worrying about my ability to not go off on him.. instead, I acted like I was super into him. Which clearly offended her as well. I just hate that the intent was never there to begin with, but we ended up seeing him again and now my entire life is going to shit. I've been through worse but I just feel so guilty even though I couldn't exactly control what I was doing. 


Any replies are appreciated greatly, but I definitely feel like a shitbag and anything to help me not feel like one would be awesome.",2019-07-07 15:31:13,2,2,relationship_advice
128,c9tebz,questions123x,My (26f) boyfriend’s (25m) porn habits make me uncomfortable. It’s even a problem on vacation.,"A few months ago, I discovered my boyfriend has a separate Reddit account just for porn. I was disappointed, considering that he would always talk about how only I turn him on (naive of me to believe him, I know), yet he loves seeing pics and videos of random girls stripping on Reddit.

Anyway, when we started dating, our sex life was really passionate and I loved it. Since then, a few things have change, he’s got a full time job (he was finishing college and job hunting before) and we moved in together. But I feel like his porn habits are part of the reason he’s not as interested in having good sex.

He’ll masturbate at work for instance and not be as into sex by the time he’s home. We’re on vacation and I have a feeling he masturbated last night (we haven’t had sex in like a week) instead of trying to have sex with me. 

It’s a total bummer, all of it. We’ve talked about it multiple times and I’ve told him how him masturbating at work, for instance, affected our sex life and he said he’ll do it less often. He still says comments that annoy me, like how he only wants to see photos of me naked and isn’t interested in seeing other women, which is total bull shit and honestly I wish he wouldn’t say those things at all because it’s like he’s lying to my face trying to be cutesy. There’s no point.

Anyway, I’m posting here to get some perspective. The porn thing aside, he’s a great boyfriend. But it almost feels like cheating at times (and I’ve never, ever felt that way about porn, so I can recognize that it’s a weird sentiment).

Update: For context, we usually have sex like 3-2 times a week, which I know isn’t bad compared to average. But idk, I’m still really bummed about the whole thing.",2019-07-06 13:06:52,131,255,relationship_advice
129,ca6kc5,fiveMop,I don't know what to do with my current relationship.,"I and my GF (both 20-21) have been together for about 15 months. before asking her out, all I could dream was being with her, I just knew her from a social media and was excited about her way of thinking and I thought she's my type because we had quite the same concerns and values. We got closer until I asked her out and she accepted.

I have to say I'm super shy and with a very low self-confidence, honestly it's still fascinating for myself that I asked her out. before knowing her I would spend almost all my time at home (except college and school), I didn't have best friends with whom I would spend time outside college and overall I'm not a flamboyant and outgoing guy but I'm more an introvert guy and keen on spending time alone reading books, coding and this kinds of stuff.

One more thing, I live in a Middle-Eastern country in which some guys have BF or GF but most parents (including ours) aren't open to this phenomenon and it's still a big surprise when you come across someone you know with her/his SO (not married) on the street.

Now we see each other every 4-5 days on the streets and cafes etc. the days we go to college we see each other more often but it certainly isn't everyday. She is sometimes upset about my reluctance to seeing her, arguing that maybe I don't love her enough or our love isn't ""burning"". I have to confess I was never burning with the need to see her, not because I didn't like her company, fortunately I was happy around her and we usually had great time together but I felt my problem rooted back to me being introverted and and that weird feeling of what if we bump into some acquaintances.

We both aren't particularly cheerful or happy-go-lucky people, with all these things going on in ME and the economic problems, life is a bit harsh at the moment. I have to add my gf has a lot of challenges in college and these makes her quite sad and depressed at least once a week, I myself have financial issues too, long story short it's not a rare thing once a week that we are not really in the right mood to talk to each other. Recently after one of these days that my gf was very sad, I tried to calm her down and tell her not to worry and give her some solutions to make things easier, I got a little angry and she got mad at me because she expected me to calm her down but I was arguing with her, she told me she was tired of our relationship and our constant arguments when one of us is feeling depressed.

The last thing I have to confess makes me ashamed of myself as hell but I should tell you. it often occurs to me that what if people judge me because of my gf appearances, she's totally fine but her nose is objectively wide and big for her face and I can't ask her to do a nose job because it's so selfish and sickening (and what if her nose didn't get better). she herself knows her nose is big and she sometimes talks about how much she hates it but she's not sure about nose job because she don't like a ""artificial"" face (she's probably worried about surgery risks too). as I said my self-confidence is very low, maybe it's not a big deal but currently these feelings are annoying me.

Honestly she loves me so much, I don't think anybody can love me as much she does. And I truly care for her, she is super important to me and I do love her but sometimes I think what if I don't love her enough, I would truly do anything she wants but when I see Instagram and pop culture intense relationships and their burning desire to spend every second together, I often question my love toward her, I fear I'm betraying her by not having a passionate love she deserves. And if I break up with her, I certainly won't start a new relationship for the next several years because I'm truly disappointed with myself.

130,ca5bqm,justgonnareadit,Help? Feeling lost,"Okay. So me and my girlfriend who have been dating for 3 years decided to take a break. We both have been arguing a lot lately and even the slightest things i do seems to annoy her. But I know one thing for sure, we both care for eachother a LOT. We both still love eachother. I'm 100% sure about that. That's why instead of breaking up we decided to take a break. Also, the 2 out of 3 years of our relationship have been a LDR cuz we are at colleges in different countries. I checked a lot online and taking a break seems like that best thing to do. I respect her and want to give her the space she wants. But im feeling very lonely and lost. Im an introvert and she used to be the only person I text. And tbh, im not the ideal boyfriend..I have my own annoying character. Which even i agree would be annoying to anyone. So I just don't know what to do right now...I am also honestly scared that what if she thinks that i was toxic and decide to end things. I don't want to lose her. Im just so fucking lost right now.

131,ca7t8b,almightyloser843,I NEED TO TALK TO HER,My girlfriend broke up with me about a few months ago. It was horrible. The whole experience was. It dragged me down emotionally and mentally. Im exaughsted. We were together 7 months. I was crazy about her. She had never been in a relationship with a woman...she was unknowingly pregnant when we started dating. We found out when she was about 6 months. I chose to stay with her. Turned out to be a mistake. Afterwards all we did was argue. Break up and make up. After she had her baby. She kinda kicked me to the curb. She didnt invite me to the hospital. She said it was because me and her babys father didnt get along. I didnt get to come around for about 2 weeks after she got home from labor. I found out her babys father had a key to her place. She told me that her mother had the spare key. But i was over there one day her mom came to visit and she knocked on the door to get in. So I asked and she lied but eventually told the truth. She said he had the key to drop things off. Well I was over there one night and her babys father came knocking and it was well past 10 and the baby was asleep. So of course that started an argument. I argue because she wouldnt compromise. She didnt see my point of view. The situation was confusing and hurtful but i was willing to try. As long as there were clear guidelines. We all talked me her and her babys father but that got no where because. He still did what he wanted to do and she let him. I believe that she wanted to be with him. Then One day we got into a huge fight. It was like 2 oclock in the morning. At first it seemed like we were getting somewhere. Then her babys father came over. Then the next thing you know she startes dogging me out. Calling me all kinds of names. Telling me that she doesnt want me. All kinds of shit. That was the night i stopped calling. She stopped calling too. Then last week she started calling me again. Out of the blue. A few times here and there. I didnt answer any of the times but i wanted to. Why is she calling now? Everytime she calls I fade deeper into myself. Because i love her and i need to talk to her. Can someone talk to me and give me some opinions. I really would like to hear. No matter. I know i probably sound pathetic but thats the shit i got myself into so now im just trying to find a way to smile again.,2019-07-07 15:08:16,2,2,relationship_advice
132,ca7syc,fuckedupfianceethrow,Fiancée (M37) was out all night drinking for the second time in two weeks. I (F31) am fully fed up. What do I do?,"I’ve been with my fiancée for almost 8 years. We got engaged a year ago and what should be the best time in our relationship has really been the worst. My fiancée drinks and does drugs a lot- pretty much anything he can get his hands on, he will do. Coke, shrooms, pain pills, alcohol, whatever he can find, he’ll do if it’s a mind altering substance. 

I have been asking him to cut back or stop, and recently I’ve been trying to get him into an outpatient treatment program as well as individual therapy. (I go to individual therapy regularly.) He still goes out and will stay out all night from drinking and supposedly is just crashing on friends’ couches, but I don’t trust him. It’s not even that I think he’s cheating, but he lies to my face without hesitation and knowing that makes it impossible to fully trust him. How can anyone trust an addict?! 

Last week, he came home being very rude and confrontational because he’d been drinking in his car **on the way home from work**. We got into a huge argument over it, I told him that his substance abuse is becoming a real deal-breaker for me, and he said to me, “Well it looks like you know what you need to do.” After saying this he left the house and didn’t come home until 3am. He slept in the guest room and when I woke up early the next day to go to a fitness class, he slunk out of the house while I showered, totally avoiding me. I slept at a friend’s house that night, while he texted me asking where I was like a true hypocrite. 

I came home the next day, and he apologized and we tried to make up. It was my birthday the next week and he took me to dinner, gave me a beautiful necklace, and then we all had brunch with some friends and my sister who was visiting. He had to go out of town for work, so he left the night of my birthday. When he came back, it was the day before  July 4. We had sex that night and then the next day, I stayed in. I wasn’t feeling very patriotic, and I had a lot of work to do. When I calmly expressed this to my fiancée while we got our morning beverages (coffee and tea) together, he began to shit talk when I left the room thinking that I couldn’t hear him. We got into an argument and he left. 

Despite sending me texts saying that he was coming home around 9pm, I didn’t see him again until the next day. Apparently, he slept at a friends on the couch. I blew up. I was furious. I yelled, I cried, I threw things. This isn’t a man I can trust, and therefore he isn’t a man I can marry. I don’t know how he doesn’t understand that his behavior is absolutely unacceptable. I don’t know how to make him understand. At this point I just don’t think he can get it. Anytime I bring it up to him he manages to somehow start talking about my behavior, the yelling. 

Now, I fully admit that when I get mad I blow up. My therapist told me once that rage is anger +fear and that really resonated with me. But this anger and fear comes after years of me begging him to realize that this is killing our relationship. Like, I wouldn’t be yelling if he hadn’t been out all night drinking for the second time in two weeks, I guess is what I mean? He’s never ready to dissect the patterns of his own behavior. It’s like dealing with a toddler sometimes. I love this man so much- if we don’t get married, I don’t know that marriage is for me. But is it just time to give up and move on? At some point, I have to accept that this is just who he is, right?

134,ca7she,sopranosea,My Boyfriend [m21] isn’t taking me [f21] seriously,"So for context we have been dating for almost 4 years, never really been big fighters we more talk it out. He still lives with his parents and I don’t. 

Lately I have been pushing back on things I usually let slide, as he says he will fix it/clean it up (whatever the issue I have brought to him). 

These issues are that his room is fuckin mess, clothes everywhere, mixed up dirty and clean, he had clothes that he wears from high school still that aren’t adult appropriate anymore. There are food wrappers and cups and bowls all around his room, he has things everywhere. All these things could be organized and fixed in a bout a few hours but he just doesn’t do it cause he’s “tired” or doesn’t want his Dad to see him rake out all that garbage. - well that excuse has run its course I’m sick of it all. He doesn’t seem to care generally about his appearance (I’m not conceded I love him for him but this is unhealthy). He also has issues with weed, which like don’t we all but he is pretty bad. So that definitely plays a part. 

Recently he had a growth on his head that I buuugggged him to go get checked out and when he FINALLY did it turned out to be cancerous. When the Doctor called to tell him all the info he didn’t write anything down and when I asked him about it he couldn’t tell me almost anything from he phone call and just kept saying “I don’t know”. Then he decided to just never book a follow up appointment until I got upset enough to be mad at him for it. Then finally he made one. He is an adult and I shouldn’t have to baby him this much, everyone goes through shit including myself so I’m just at a loss as what to do, cause I love him very much and he always makes me laugh. 

Pretty much I just want the best for him, and for him to be happy, which he is sometimes, but I think he could function so much better if he just took better care of himself. 

What should I do? I don’t want to stop dating him but I really need him to get it together a bit, and put in some effort.

It’s the longest adult relationship I’ve ever had.  She has many amazing things about her, but also a few things that drive me nuts.

For one, we’re not not on the same page in terms of finances.  She just graduated and luckily only has $5,000 in credit card debt.  Over our entire relationship, she’s never worked a ton.  Maybe 30 hours a week max.  She’s currently working about 16 hours a week and will maybe get 24 hours by the end of the month.  This means that I’m currently paying for 95% of the stuff we do/eat/drink (including vacations, dinners, etc).

For the first few months we were dating, I set the expectation that I really think dating should be 50/50 (or at least 60/40), and it was going fine at first.  She comes from a Mexican background, so she expressed that culturally she believed I should be paying for everything.  I firmly believe in splitting things equally and expressed this, so we continued to split things 60/40.

A few months in, she admitted she was maxing her cards out to pay her end sometimes.  She was in school at the time and I basically thought, “well, I can pay for her right now, but she’ll start working more when she’s out of school.”  Now that she’s out of school, she is showing zero drive or motivation to work more or make money.  I know she has a ton of free time because we hangout a lot, she takes naps during the day, and she visits with family all the time (she lives at home).

I was talking about buying a house a few months ago and we spoke about how we’d potentially be living together.  I believe we should pay 50/50 or 60/40, but she has the attitude of, “why would I be paying part of your mortgage?”  She would be paying someone’s mortgage regardless, so it just felt a bit petty.



I’ve brought up finances a ton.  Probably 6 times in the last 6-8 months.  And it’s still an issue.  We ended up fighting last night and broke up this morning and now I’m doubting myself whether or not I’m justified in ending a relationship because of this (among other little things I won’t get into).

So we hanged out a bit and I used to crack jokes and all and make her laugh alot. She asked me for snap and instagram, which I don't have so I told her. But soon as time wore I got more and more attracted. Soon I got her number and we started chatting mostly innocent things, but slightly flirting. However that ended real quick in like a week or so, one day we were talking about past relationships and she said she had a ""boyfriend"". Note I put the apostrophes around the word boyfriend because, I usually see her around school and not once did the ever see her with her ""boyfriend"" also it seems really odd to me that. But didn't say anything about it to her. At this point (note is it still around two months ago) I stopped texting her, but I still talked to her, without flirting this time). But around a month ago or so, she started texting me again, it started off as questions about school assignments and all. But soon we went back to flirting again. But on the last of school I was hanging out with her and we were talking, she bought up the topic of her boyfriend again. Which kinda confused me, because if she had a boyfriend, why would she text me and even flirt with me? So I for the rest of the time we were together I kinda have her the cold shoulder by looking mostly at my phone instead of giving her attention. She causually smiled and tried to look at what I was doing and my phone and I just told her I was checking emails for a job. And that was that That was more than two weeks ago. And we never talked since, not even a text. To be extremely honest I really miss her, I know it sounds weird
Tl;Dr I have a female friend who apparently has a boyfriend but used to text and flirt with me. I am seriously confused a out her intentions. 
All of this really confused the shit outta me, I was attracted to her ngl until I heard she had a boyfriend, but what doesn't make sense is her flirting with me. I told a couple of my friends about this situation and they said she probably bought up the topic of her ""boyfriend"" to make me jealous and she probably doesn't even have a boyfriend. I am seriously confused by her and any type of advice is extremely appreciated. Just to clarify I am not the type of guy who flirts with girls who have a boyfriend. The reason why I went along with her flirting is because I thought her and her boyfriend broke up or something. If she even had a boyfriend.

140,ca5pcz,blondeambition-TK,"The daughter my mom gave up at 16 has contacted my mom for the first time, after 30 years. How can I support my mom?","My mom (47F) had a child when she was 16. Her family sent her away, she had a daughter who she never saw and the baby was given up for adoption. She since got married and had three more daughters. I am the middle daughter (24F). *note- we have immigrated so we do not live in the same country as my half sister* My mom told us all about this child, I found out about 8 years ago. It was never spoken about openly as it was obviously a very painful thing, but it was not a secret. My mom has just told me that she has heard from the daughter she gave up and they have started to slowly talk. I am not surprised. In this time of the Book of Faces, I had expected it would happen at some point. I found out that I’m an Aunty, and I’m very happy because I know my mom has always thought about this child, my half sister. 

I really want to be supportive and help her through anything that comes up. Obviously with any situation where a child has been given up, there are bound to be some hard feelings to work through on all parties. I am personally happy they have reconnected but it is super weird to find out you have a nephew and to see a photo of your half sister. 

Does anyone have any advice from being in a similar situation, or any advice on how I can support my mom through this?",2019-07-07 11:06:49,0,4,relationship_advice
141,caa4pr,wela_wahine,"Does it sound like my BF of 10 months just isn’t into me after all, and is just with me out of convenience?","Sorry guys, I’m reposting this- it was late last night when I did, and I’d like to get more feedback because it’s just eating away at me this morning.
I don’t know why I’ve been feeling so insecure lately, but I’m having these thoughts that my boyfriend might not be into me. 

We’ve been together 10 months. I’ll mention some positive things- He is very respectful towards me, we haven’t even gotten into a fight yet. When we are together, he is very much “there”, focuses on me, is very affectionate physically, hugs me, kisses me, the other night he just held me through the night. We both have kids from a previous marriage and have recently met them. The kids get along great. When first entering this relationship, we both told each other we haven’t introduced our kids to anyone we’ve dated and wouldn’t do that with anyone unless we’re serious about them. Well here we are 10 months later and we have done just that.

Some negative things that get me thinking- He’s a workaholic. And I mean, when he’s not with his kids, he is consumed with his work that sometimes I feel like he’s absent and doesn’t always reach out first. He’s also not verbally affectionate. AT ALL. No sweet words, no compliments, no pet names. Nothing. He will reciprocate if I tell him I miss him or can’t wait to see him, but won’t say it first. No “I love you”, but none from me either, only because I’m afraid I won’t get the response I want and it will bring me down. 

Like I mentioned though, a totally different man when we’re together, he shows how much he cares in that sense. What got me thinking last night though, was that the other night, he downloaded an app on his TV which requires a paid subscription, which I have. I offered to share with him a couple of months ago so no big deal, but he texted me the other night just to ask about the download and my credentials. Fine. Then yesterday, I hear nothing from him, granted he is with his kids so I’m not expecting it, but he texts me later on last night. Not to say hello, not even a conversation starter, not to ask how I’m doing, but his very first question is if I’m watching the event on the app. I tell him no, and ask him if he was. He said he was trying to while the kids were playing but it requires a purchase in addition to my paid subscription. I had to explain how it works. But basically this made me feel like crap that this is the only reason he feels compelled to reach out to me. For his benefit. Am I reading too much into this? With all the things I’ve listed about (positive and negative), along with him reaching out via text last night just to ask about getting the event, does it sound like he’s just not really into me after all and with me out of convenience?",2019-07-07 18:30:48,0,1,relationship_advice
142,c9vk8d,Throwaway8456222,I got my husband into anal play and now it feels like a competition,"Ive(f,36) been married to my husband(m, 37)for 10 years. When we started dating my sex drive was higher than his, but after 3 kids we have sex about once a week. 3 years ago, I introduced him to toys and prostate pleasure. It was a whole new world for him and our intimacy increased substantially. To my delight, he was open to being pegged and we both enjoy it a lot. The problem is, he no longer seems to have any interest in PIV intercourse. When he gets horny he gets himself off with toys during showers and doesn’t hide it. I can understand that the pleasure is substantial, but I selfishly feel like I taught him and now am no longer an important part of his sex life. He has given no indication that he is not sexually attracted to me, I know that he is, but prostate orgasms are just better and he doesn’t need me for them. Besides anal play alongside PIV(which we do sometimes, but again, it’s not as intense as pegging which is solely focused on his prostrate pleasure), what can I do to remind him of how good it can feel to be intimate while worshiping each other’s bodies?",2019-07-06 16:36:06,31,119,relationship_advice

144,ca7jva,Rasoma,Someone please give me advice,"Hello,
I'm writing this today because I want to go over all my options in a unbias way. Currently my situation is a little complicated with the person that I love .. and I know that they love me.. we had been dating for over a year, lived together, and planned a future together. She just graduated college and I just joined in the military service . She will be studying abroad while I am away - which we planned together. She was staying with her family for the summer before she leaves and I went to visit her for 5 days. On the 3rd day she breaks up with me. Saying that she still loves me. Wants to be with me. Doesn't want to lose me. But wants to take a break because she keeps putting the relationship first and doesn't know what's gonna happen with us since the plan keeps changing. She also said that she wants to see where we were at when we both came back - study aboard and military training. Backstory: my family is going through some stuff and basiclly putting a strain on our relationship because it's stress me out and hurts me. Also I had been planning on moving out but realistically I can since I have to think of where to move and how experience it is. I do hold down a full time job and had been actitively looking for a second one - no luck with my schedule. So I joined the military to put myself in a better position. After the break up she was still cuddling me. Kissing me. Wanting to be around me. But I didn't know how to act since obviously she broke up with me. Plus she also mentioned how she wanted to not put the relationship first and wanted to grow as a person. I came home and I couldn't even amount the courage to reach out to her, so I didn't. She however reached out to me. Then she asked me if I was coming back to see her. I had bought two plane tickets back to back one for 5 days and one for 10 days - was going to be home for less than a week and go back . I told her that I wanted to see her and that I wanted to spend time with her. Then she said there would be ground rules. I'm like what ..? First we wouldn't be sleeping in the same room plus I also has to let her do her own thing like working out and stretching . Never stopped her from doing that when I was there but okay . Then she said she didn't want to feel awkward sleeping in the same room as me. And was determined to not get back together before she left to study aboard . So I asked her if she wanted to see me because in all reality it didnt sound like it. She said that she will be okay with whatever I decided and wanted to make the decision up to me . So I came up with several conclusions 1) she doesn't want to be in a relationship 2) she doesn't want to lose me 3) she wants her space to grow 4) she set ground rules . As I thought about it I told her I wanted to spend time with her and that is she changed her mind about me going then to let me know . She went ahead and said that it would be better for our mental health if I didn't go. So I told her that I would respect her decision and that I would give her space . She still texts me like every other day but I don't know what I should really say or act. I have already told her how I feel in terms of wanting to be with her and that I want to work things out . But... I don't know.. which is why I want outside help.

145,caa3y1,throwaway123-918,I(17M) am having repetitive symptoms of void and lack of feelings after a while going out with the same person,"Hi all, so obviously this is a throwaway as I don't want anybody finding out about this

anyways, I'm 17M close to 18, and have always considered relationships an important thing in life, in fact I was with the same girl for 2 years already, but I broke up with her last February due to various reasons(trying to changing me, incompatibilities of our futures, extremely stressful relationship to the extent where I was more stressed about that than my A levels, and the feelings I described which I felt for the first time with her)

Now last April I started dating another girl and we have been together for 2.5 months and initially I thought that we were really compatible and so, and I still consider her to be a great person despite that she always wants to get way and she tends to get pissed and make remarks about things that I typically don't expect that a person reacts in that way(Like getting pissed that I didn't want to go over to her house and meet her parents after the 2nd date whereas I'm used to meeting the parents at least after 2 months) but I still consider her as a great person just like my ex despite the mentioned issues(I don't expect anybody to be perfect so).

Anyways skipping to the main problem, as I have already said with my ex I started to feel this intense boredom, void, suffocation and lack of happiness and feelings when I started spending a lot of time with her(This started when we were together for like 1 yr 10 months and I noticed it first when I spent like 4 days straight with her), now I'm experiencing the same symptoms with the girl I'm dating despite not spending the same amount of time with her(I mean we are hanging out 4 days straight every week but only one of them is a whole day unlike my ex). This time around I started to notice lack of feelings for her 2 weeks ago and today I started noticing the rest of the symptoms which I am still feeling after I left from her side.

My question is, is something wrong with me that is causing all of this? As I thought of potential depression(which I doubt as at least right now I consider it the best phase of my life) or commitment issues. And is there some way I can fix this?

Thank you for your help in advance! I really appreciate it as I really don't know what to do about this.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Realized that I might have explained myself badly so: 

Sorry I may have explained myself badly. I don't seek relationships for happiness or to fill a void at least I no longer do, I do have hobbies and I am happy on my own, my problem is that when I spend a long time with the girl I'm dating after a while I have been with her these symptoms start showing up. They typically go away when I'm back on my own(what I meant by still feeling them is mainly caused by me worrying about what is wrong)",2019-07-07 18:29:03,3,1,relationship_advice
146,caa33t,Kondilla,"My girlfriend (20) and I (20M) are halfway around the world together, yet I’m still having doubts. What do I do?","I’ve been with my girlfriend (pretend she’s called Chloe) since January 2017, other than a 3 week breakup in January 2018. We live in England and met in college, but we’re currently in Japan on a Working Holiday Visa with my twin brother.

I think it’s safe to say that our relationship hasn’t been smooth sailing. We’ve had a lot of good times together, but there have been many bumps along the way, which I guess is normal as this is the first serious relationship for both of us.

Most of these bumps have been over silly things that I don’t remember anymore, but there have been some much bigger ones. I can think of straight away when I found out she kissed two guys in the period we weren’t together, which made me emotional as hell as I guess I was still in love with her and sad we weren’t together (I don’t think I realised as we were still having sex once a week during that time).

The biggest issue I’ve had, however, is when there was a situation between Chloe, myself and a guy she worked with back in about September 2018, who I’ll pretend is called Tom (20M). Chloe had been working with Tom for around 18 months and I was aware of their friendship (I’d heard stories about work and seen them message here and there, but nothing inappropriate), which I was completely fine with as he’s just a dude from work. I eventually met him when I went clubbing with her and other people from her work, but we didn’t speak other than a quick introduction.

I found out a day or two later that Tom began crying when I left the club with Chloe (we left early). I was confused at first, but I was told that he confessed to another guy there that he likes Chloe and doesn’t see why she doesn’t like him back. I wasn’t too surprised since he’s a guy and Chloe is a very attractive girl, but I wasn’t too worried. As the weeks went on, Tom began making jokes about me to Chloe and co-workers, which wouldn’t usually bother me, but it did since I don’t know the guy, it’s clearly because he liked Chloe and I hadn’t gotten much indication that Chloe had my back. I raised this with her and said I didn’t appreciate it (I knew his motive), but I got met with “it’s nothing, don’t worry” and the like.

This escalated very quickly over time, which made me frustrated as I knew that Chloe and Tom were still good friends, despite the constant name-calling and jokes behind my back. I had met him again once in this time when Chloe and I went out for food with a few of her co-workers, which I was met with a pretty cold reaction from Tom whenever I spoke, which wasn’t much. My self-esteem was quite low at this point, which sucked.

We went clubbing again with a large group of her co-workers, including Tom, but this time I invited my twin brother, who we’ll say is called Jason. I had vented a little bit to Jason about the situation, but not too much. While we were at a pub, Jason and Chloe were having an arm-wrestle, which caught the attention of some people who we weren’t with. Some guys in the pub were cheering for Chloe, including one who jokingly yelled out “Break his arm!”, which is cool, I knew it was a joke. Despite this, Tom walked past at this moment and mumbled “Yeah good” under his breath in response to the comment. I was pissed at this point, so I stopped the match and took Jason to one side. Chloe had asked me not to make a scene if anything happened that night, which I was struggling with at this point, so I just vented instead.

The final nail in the coffin on that night was when Tom and Chloe were walking in front of Jason and I. During this walk, he chose to put his arm around Chloe whilst laughing, which made me fume. Two seconds later, I had caught up with them and put my arm around Chloe, then calling Jason to catch up as I walked off with her. Despite this and knowing how uncomfortable I felt around Tom, Chloe still resumed her friendship with Tom as if nothing was happening, which made me confused as hell as I felt she didn’t have my back.

We went out for her work’s Christmas party in January this year (not December, I know), which of course, Tom attended. Despite not being allocated to our table, Tom sat next to Chloe anyway later into the night, which caught my attention, but I decided to see how things played out without saying anything. I was sitting on the other side of Chloe, however I was suddenly facing her back as she spoke with Tom. I was facing her front before long, but that’s because she sat closer to him and just changed direction so they could speak side-on. This lasted between 30-40 minutes, and I was ignored by both the entire time. I decided to go to the toilet as I contemplated going home, but I didn’t and walked out 10 minutes later, when I pulled Chloe to one side. I told her how I felt she was being disrespectful by ignoring me when I have no friends at the party and talking closely to the one guy I had legitimate problems with. She said she understood and we left about 45 minutes later.

This situation begun to fizzle out after she finally spoke to Tom about how I felt, but it wasn’t how I imagined it would be. She told me that she said to him “Daniel (me) thinks you’re being mean about him and he doesn’t like it”, or something along those lines. I didn’t know where to start at this point. She said it with such little care and as though her parents had told her she has to tell her friend they can’t have a sleepover on a school night... I told her exactly how I felt and that she hasn’t had my back once in this entire situation, despite feeling so strongly about always having the back of your SO. We argued for at least an hour about the entire thing, but I at least got a semi-okay result from what she said as the jokes pretty much stopped and he wasn’t making moves on Chloe from what I could tell. Apparently he has a girlfriend now anyway, so that’s that. Sorry for harping on that for so long, it’s a long winded story and still bothers me now to a fair extent.

Since then, I’ve had some uneasiness about whether she truly likes me or has my back, which has made me pretty sad. I wouldn’t say I’m depressed, but I’d be lying if I said I haven’t shown any symptoms of it. It’s important to note that I had already been feeling some doubts since around June 2018, so obviously this made things a lot worse.

Now being in Japan until May 2020, she knows that I have doubts about us, but I ideally want a great relationship with her and she knows this. She has told me since that she understands how I felt during the situation with Tom, but I do feel it’s too little too late. I was open about my feelings on the situation, but she felt I wasn’t being completely honest, so she decided to go through my texts with my friend (pretend he’s called Nathan (25M)), which I obviously wasn’t happy about, but I couldn’t be mad about that for long at all.

I had texted Nathan the day before about my frustrations with my relationship, including little things which had somewhat led to overall unhappiness in it. That wasn’t the part she cared about though, nor the part where I expressed how much I care about her and don’t want to hurt her ever. She saw I had texted Nathan about the Japanese women around me and how if I were single, I would be trying my best with them. It didn’t help how I said I was jealous of my single brother and that there’s a hot girl in my volleyball club.

I explained that I’m not jealous of my brother, I genuinely did say that in the heat of the moment and she knows that now. The girl in my club was the part that upset her the most and that I basically said that I look at other girls around me. The truth is that I don’t fancy anybody else, I just find other people attractive, which we both think is natural and okay.

We’ve spoken numerous times about this situation about the texts (it was about 5 days ago), but I think she herself has started to become depressed, or at least showing symptoms. This is mainly staying indoors in the dark watching Netflix without me. I should note that she only really came to Japan on a year’s visa because of me, which is why we got back together I guess.

I don’t want to hurt her, which I know will happen if I end things with her. At the same time, I feel like I’m hurting her by being with her, which I think I can relate to in a number of ways. Despite what I wrote, she’s a great person and I have a lot of love for her, but I’m not convinced that it’s meant to be after having a year of doubts.

If I end things now, I don’t know if she’ll go home or if she’ll stay. If I had to guess, I think she’d stay initially, but soon go home. We’ve had good times even since being here and I want the best for her, but I also want the best for myself. I won’t lie, I can feel envious of those who can have fun with no strings attached, especially here as I’ve always found Asian women attractive. I’ve never had that experience, so I think it’s normal to want to try things like that.

If anybody read my long-ass post and is able to help, I’d be extremely grateful. I’m scared of making the wrong decision and losing each other would make both of us sad, but is it possible to make things better at this point?",2019-07-07 18:27:03,0,1,relationship_advice
147,caa2qi,losttheway06,"Am I overreacting? Maybe yes, maybe not","This is a long story but I could use some perspective on this. I plan to talk to a professional but it will be a few weeks before I can.
A pinch of background, I feel like my wife and I have been growing a part so to speak for a time now. There has been a good amount of bickering as well. I am usually to blame for things and this has been true all of the 5 years we have been together. I have usually just pushed it under the rug, except when it came to big fights. Then it would come to the surface.
Fast forward to last month when we went on a family trip - the first one she has ever taken with my family. (she has come with me for multi-day visits to visit my family prior to this). I have had the feeling in the past that she didn't much like my family through her actions and non-verbal cues.
The first day or two was nice and I felt like some progress as far as her becoming more integrated with my family might be occurring. On the third day however we were going boating for my dad's bday. She hates boating but wanted to come instead of hanging at the dock. We woke up and got moving a bit late. I jumped into the shower and a couple of minutes in asked what time it was. I got the time barked back at me. I asked her if she was going to be ready on time. She said hopefully. I reminded her that we had to be downstairs at a certain time to make it to the boat on time. A few minutes later, I asked for an update on the time and was yelled at about how she cant be getting ready and looking at the time and now I was making her late. She told me she would have been on time but would now be late since she had to tell me what time it was. (this was a hotel room and her watch was on her wrist). I got a little upset at that and we started bickering which finally lead me to tell her that if she was going to have a bad attitude, I didn't want her ruining my dad's birthday boating outing since she was now telling me how much she hated boating etc. This bickering followed us downstairs which got into a yelling match and ended in a blow out. We went boating.
Two days later, we were getting ready to park at an event and couldn't find parking due to a local holiday that we were unaware of. My father was getting a little frustrated and made mention that the difficulty in finding parking was due to the ""queer-ass holiday."" Now, a quick note - he is NOT homophobic in anyway. Politically incorrect? Sometimes but he is 65 and when he grew up, and for most of his life, queer has meant unusual, or odd - seriously, look it up. To this day, that is the number one meaning in the dictionary. My wife took great exception to this and instead of asking him what he meant or pointing out how that could be offensive or politically incorrect, flew off the handle and in the voice a parent takes with a misbehaving child, dresses him down in front of the whole car. He sternly tells her to stop talking to him like that which escalates the situation. She starts yelling at him about how it is homophobic and telling him to knock it off etc. It was very disrespectful and not in a million years would I treat her parents that way. He demands an apology which she refuses and now I am stuck in the middle of the awkward for the rest of the day. I talk to her about it and explain to her that he is not in any way homophobic which she refuses to accept and she tells me she will not be apologizing for what she said (basically calling him a homophob) but would for her attitude. She never did. She didnt apologize to me or to him or the rest of my family that day.
When we were telling my parents goodbye at the airport, my mother pulls her aside to let her know how hurtful the whole incident had been to me and my parents. My mother told her that she should apologize and told her that my father did not mean what he said in a derogatory way. My wife refused to believe her and said she would not apologize. A few minutes later she did as we said our final goodbyes. But from my mothers account, could not have been any more insincere about it if she tried. My father didn't notice this and accepted.
On the flight home, I saw her writing in her journal and saw some words that looked really negative. The whole incident had been bothering me since it occurred and this was not the first time that someone, including me, had tried to tell her that she could have been wrong about something. She almost never will admit that.
The next day I went to go look in her journal, hoping that what I had seen on the plane was out of context and I was wrong. Yes, I know that I should not have been looking but I was hoping to find something positive to make the situation better. Instead what I found made it worse. In the journal she writes about what a terrible vacation it was. She writes that she never really liked my dad but didn't have strong feelings either way until this trip. Afterward she writes that she has learned he is a homophobic person who is self-centered and a racist. She also writes that she was ""harangued"" by my mother into apologizing and that while she did say sorry, she didn't mean it. She jots that she used to think my mother was just ""southern, sweet and small town"" but now has learned that she is just a ""dumb hick"" (my mother was born in Texas and left at age 6 for the west. She kept nothing from Texas). The whole family is ""whinny."" She hopes that my father ""never retires"" and that my grandmother lives for a ""very, very long time so that they never move"" to where we live. She is horrified at the thought of raising kids around my parents and dreads the next scheduled trip to see them later this month.
A couple of days after we got back, I confronted my wife about the journal and the whole trip. I still never got an apology for the hurt she had caused me, she continued to argue she was justified - if for nothing else - because she matched his tone ( she didn't, she created it) and because she still thinks she is right and that he is homophobic, or at least his words were and that must have been his meaning. We agreed on a couple of things to work on like the bickering but to me that is not the overarching issue here. It is the fact she cant ever be wrong, writes that she hates my family and doesn't want out potential future kids anywhere around them and the fact that somehow its always my fault.
Ok now that the very long story is out of the way, this has me feeling really really shitty and contemplating what my future is with my wife. Am I over-reacting here? Is this less of a big deal than I think? Is it - as she claims - just some anger she was writing down to get it out but that she didnt mean?

I admit I’ve been quite a burden on him. I am an extremely sensitive person and take everything to heart. I don’t want to be like this anymore. Another thing I hate to admit is despite being able to apologize, (I often do the very next day), I cant bring myself to apologize then and there because of my “pride”. The thing is I don’t even think highly of myself, I guess I just don’t like showing that I am vulnerable. I suspect this may be because of my past, but that doesn’t matter. I’m not trying to blame anyone or anything. 

My boyfriend tells me I am not a burden and always finds a way to fix the situation. He never holds grudges with me. But I can feel my issues taking a toll on him. I feel like an awful person for this. 

Where do I start? What can I do in-the-moment of a grudge I’m about to hold? How can I relax? I tend to isolate myself for hours to let myself think but it isn’t ideal for me nor him.

149,caa2k0,Throwwawayy3929t,He (19m) broke up with me (19f) a month ago but he said that he wants to be friends. So who makes the first move and when?,"We go to the same uni and dated for 4 months. In the couple of weeks before we left, I felt a sort of disconnect between us. I asked him if everything was ok (with him, us, etc.) and he said everything was fine. I wrote it up as stress about upcoming exams and about being in a LDR until next semester (something that he had brought up on his own).

It was not fine. The three weeks after we left to go to our homes, he barely texted me. After a week, I asked when he had time for a phone call or Skype and he said he was busy. After another week, we set up a time but he then cancelled last minute. The third week, I finally got the call and that's when he said that he wanted to end it.

Basically his reasons why was that he felt that during the last couple weeks of school, the time before seeing me felt like the time before going to a class. And that even though the time we spent actually together was fun and great, he couldn't escape the before feeling. That the limited contact with me after we left made him feel happier.

So he ended it with saying that it was his fault for keeping up a false face that everything was ok, that I deserve someone better, and that he wants to be friends.

This was my first relationship and I do want to be friends with him since we have many shared interests. But should I wait another two months until we're at school to start contacting each other again or is one month enough time. 

Tdlr: my first bf broke up with me bc he felt that  getting ready seeing me was like getting ready to go to class and he felt happier away from me. He hid this feeling from me and said everything was ok. He wants us to be friends (which I'm totally for since we have so many shared interests) but I'm fuzzy on the logistics.",2019-07-07 18:25:49,2,1,relationship_advice
150,caa1h9,CF4643,Should I Contact My Estranged Father?,"Let’s start with a little background. My (M41) mother was my father’s second marriage of five. When I was about 4, he took me in the middle of the night (kidnapped me) and moved me out of state. My mother tried getting me back, but back in the 70’s, parental kidnapping wasn’t treated as it is today. She was not able to locate us until I was about 9 or 10 and my father agreed to have my older half brother come visit us. However, not before telling her that if my brother tried to take me, he would take me out in the woods, kill me, and then kill himself. She told me all this years later. She decided at that point, it would be even more traumatic taking me back as I had a whole new life in another state and she didn’t have the resources to safely get me back to her. He always told me growing up that my mother only had me for him and that she was a drug addict. I believed him and never had contact with my mother until much later in life. 

At 21, curiosity got the best of me and I found one of my three half brothers online. Through him, I got my mother’s phone number and contacted her. We ended up building a relationship over the years until she passed away a a few years ago. But because of what she told me about my father and a journal I found while cleaning out my step mother’s apartment after her death, I decided to cut ties with him. He was always an alcoholic, so I had a pretty traumatic childhood at least emotionally, but now I knew he was also an abuser of probably every woman he had ever married. I was beyond angry at him. He had stolen what childhood I could have had and spent years lying to me about everything. He even used my social security number for various things (we have the same name) and at 18, I found out I already had a terrible credit score. He also spent my college inheritance from my grandfather who died before I was 18. He denied ever doing any of these things and used to get very angry with me if I brought the topics up. 

It’s been about six years since we’ve spoken and I’ve never told him why I stopped communicating with him. Although, I assume he knows why. As he ages, (he’s in his 70’s now) I wonder if I’ll regret just cutting him off like I did with no explanation after he dies. To clarify, I want no sort of relationship with him at all. But, I worry sometimes that he’ll die and I’ll have regrets. Anyone with a somewhat similar experience care to chime in? I know everyone has a different story, but surely someone out there can relate. Opinions on what I should do? If anything? Thanks for reading.

151,ca7h9d,turquoise4216,I [16F] am trapped between my so called bestfriend [16F] and her boyfriend [16M],"So firstly I'd give a bit of a background to my story. So my bestfriend has been a person who has been using me...whenever she gets no one she comes to me, doesn't listen to my problems and always talks about herself and her life. I realised it recently that it's better to end this toxic friendship.. So now slowly I'm trying to distance myself from her.
 Her boyfriend and I have been talking alot lately. He casually flirts but i dont really flirt back thinking I'd become a bad friend.
Last night he called me and said he wanted to tell me something and he doesn't want me to tell that to my bestfriend. He told me that he has been feeling that their relationship isn't working out. He also mentioned how her being self centered and talking about herself has really affected everything. He told that he is just sick of her using him as wallet, showing off and always feeling so dependent on him. He even said he's breaking up with her, however slowly and on good terms so that it does not get awkward in future.
He actually said to me later after our 2 hour call that he wants to kiss me, I of course said no and said that I haven't kissed anyone yet and I'm kinda saving my first kiss for future. He said first kisses don't really matter and that'd help me just learn how to kiss because everyone know it. I didn't reply anything to this.
He kinda attracts me however I'm scared that if after his breakup I'd get involved with him romantically then I'd become a bad friend. I'm just so trapped that what if in this process I become a bad and toxic person.",2019-07-07 14:36:33,5,2,relationship_advice

Long story short once again I’m feeling the same way and I realize I should have stuck to my guns with the first go around. What I feared would happen has happened and I feel the same way again.

I do love this girl and she is a great person and all I just don’t feel it and I don’t see myself staying with her. In my mind the decision is made. But I am conflicted about when to break it to her.

Problem is we booked a trip to fly across country which is taking place in a month where she was going to see where I’m from and meet some of my family. The trip was already planned between my brothers and I and bringing her half way through was an add to the trip as I wanted to show her around and have her meet my family. 

Now I feel that in a sense it would be kind to her if I were to bring her anyways let her have the good experience and then break it off afterwards as we have been waiting for this trip for some time now. But the other part of me wants to be selfish and say it now get it over with and enjoy my trip by myself. I’ll certainly be feeling crappy after the break up even though it’s once again my decision. 

Any pointers any advice on what you would prefer as a women or as a person getting broken up with.

Appreciate it a lot. I know I haven’t gone into too much detail about our relationship but I do think she is a great girl and I love her but it just doesn’t feel right and I’ve been down this road before and I don’t want to waste either of our time.

tl;dr: I've been losing hope in my relatioship but I kinda wanna see where this is going.

Hello! 

First some backgroud (a copy of a post i did on r/relationships):

""My (19f) boyfriend (20m) of more or less 3 years keeps lying to me, then telling me the true and apologizing or, as it happens almost everytime, I end up casualy finding everything out.

These lies are more like omissions. He goes out and tells me he was at home or tries drugs without me after telling me we would do it together. He says he doesn't even gets himself and doesn't know how he can be so selfish.

We are very close and almost everything in this relationship is amazing. We are friends above all and that's why these occurrences mean so much. When he tells me the true he knows he has fucked up. It doesn't happen a lot but it is enough for me to start thinking I may be fighting a lost cause.

Above all this, my anxiety is really triggered by this kind of situations...I can barelly sleep and feel my tummy all day.

**I love him** and I wish I could just live with this, but I lose a little bit of cofidence in him everytime this happens.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

As I said, normally I get really really anxious with this kind of situations but this time I really tried to focus on me and not on the problem. I've been really successfull on not crying and not panicking. At the same time, I'm not interested in resolving the problem and am in a position of ""well it will happen again, maybe I can just try to live with this"". I know i probably won't and that this relationship might be doomed. But I guess I can still enjoy the good things about me and him and just take it easy? 

I may be just trying to cope...maybe this is not the healthiest way to deal with this...

I'm not even feeling too sad, maybe I am just giving up slowly?

She would often put her friends and most importantly herself after me, hang up whenever she felt like she was offended, and hardly paid attention to my stories and emotions. I really loved her and she said she do too. I don't get it. fuck. She always told me that she want to meet more guys, but at the same time told me that if she don't have the chance to, she wont. She believed in soulmate, that she will meet someone that fits her perfectly. I couldn't see the changes that she told me she is trying to have, and I couldn't see anything that she was trying to do for ME.

I don't understand. I feel like she will be so sad after she realizes that I was the one giving all the love and attention, my love being different and unique than others. It's so sad and heartbreaking thinking about how much pain she would be in, even though she might not.

im 20

Both not first time.

He eventually contacted me and said i should leave her for a month or two to see if she really loves me, i assume he was trying  to manipulate me it didnt work and brushed it off.

After 2 months pass he turns up outside her house asking to see her she was home alone and hes mental state wasnt the  best so she didnt feel comfortable going outside he stayed outside for an hour pleaing for her to take him back, when he had enough he left leaving her scared and in tears.

3 months the calling stopped and he stopped harrasing her but out of no where he starts calling her on no caller id which cannot be blocked on iPhones he calls her atleast 300 times a day and there is nothing she can do about it. A few days agoi picked up and said stop calling please its annoying and he started asking personal question about our relationship he asked where i was and i said shes at my house watching TV even though she wasnt i said this as i had moved houses 3 weeks ago and even if he went to my house it would be my old house, but somehow he turned up at my new house my friends who are the only people that know about my new house claim to not tell him the address which i believe but theres still the question on how he found out where i live.

165,ca9vjf,evolaalove,How wrong is it to hang out once with a guy you talked to many years ago while you're currently in a relationship?,"Hey guys, I'm in need of advice.
Many years ago when I was around 17 (currently 22) dated a guy for about month or two and have hung out with him once or twice during the couple of years after. 
During that time, we simply hung out and I made it clear that I was in a relationship before doing so (my boyfriend at the time was mature, fine with it, and trusted me). Just recently, after a couple years or so of me and this guy never speaking, he messaged me saying he moved back in town and wanted to catch up and invite me to a quarry with his friends. 
I have absolutely no interest in the possibility of forming a love interest towards him again. I find him solely as a really fun person to hang out with. I have trouble forming female friendships and rarely hang out so I really would enjoy going. I plan to consult with my current boyfriend before giving any answer but I am already fairly confident he won't be okay with it due to self esteem issues. Would this mean I couldn't go? I understand the point of respecting his feelings but I feel that should be something mutual. He knows I have a lot of trouble making female friends, rarely go out, and get along much better with men. I'd just hate to miss out on getting out for once because of the history when I know I would never let anything closely inappropriate happen. I dunno what to do guys.

166,ca9uzd,Needhelplzzzzz,Me(29m) and my exgf(23) have had a bad falling out and need advice.,"I pretty much know what going to be said but going to write it anyways just for reconfirmation as this is the most dysfunctional relationship ever.  My exgf was my friends gf until one night at a party she pissed him off and then he left and she had no way to get home so she asked me to give her a ride home and she said she wanted to sleep at my house (later on she would say I had taken advantage of her. we were both drunk).  I'm at fault here too obviously but anyways the next morning the boyfriend climbed my tree and broke into my house to find us together in bed.  He kicked her out of his house.  I let her stay at my house for less than a month before asking her to find a new place because I needed time to think.  I liked her but the circumstances of her dating a friend and dating my best friend even before that who cheated on her and ""destroyed her"" as she said herself.  Anyways she lived at a friends house for a few months and we were still going out but she cheated on me with several guys I found out later but I was always forgiving and she moved back in.

Throughout our relationship whenever I would hang out with my friends she would start texting me all crazy without saying really much of anything until one day I said you're making me feel like killing myself.  She broke up with me and started fucking another dude but came back a couple weeks later and I took her back.  fast forward a few months and shes bored with me and I looked at her phone while shes sleeping and saw texts from another guy at 4am and thought that was weird.  I said I thought this was unacceptable and eventually broke up with her after a few days as she would not stop talking to him.  They end up having sex and this time I come back to her saying I want her back and she breaks it off with him and comes back to me giving me chlamydia which I didn't find out until way later after I took an std test because I thought she was cheating on me with more people.  Maybe I'm not the best boyfriend.  I have severe depression and anxiety and am not the easiest to talk to because I withdraw a lot.

anyways  everything goes good for awhile for like a year but then I look at her phone and text messages from another guy late at night so I say this is the end and breakup with her but again come back after a month wanting her back and she breaks up with her boyfriend again.  This time is felt it would be real as she said she loved me and begged me not to hurt her but I go to hang out with my best friend again (the one who she had an obsession with). we are not allowed to hangout all together because of my best friends girlfriend.  She starts texting me all crazy saying I'm the worst person and that shes going back to fuck her exbf and I ignored.  There was another girl at my friends house who was hitting on me and I ended up having sex with her.  The next day my exgf came over apologizing to me saying she wanted to stay together and she was sorry.  I said I understand and want to stay with her but there was something she needed to know.  That I slept with another girl but it meant nothing and if anything was revenge for her cheating on me so much.  She blew up and said this was unacceptable and that we could never get back together.  We tried to talk it out but she wouldn't stop being crazy so I said I would block her as I thought it would probably be for the best.   This lasted a month until I missed her and unblocked her.  The next day she texted me as she had apparently been texting me things every night she showed me later saying she was talking to herself using it as a journal.  anyways she had a new boyfriend but wanted to hangout.  She would try to talk to me about their sex life which really offended me but eventually she breaks up with him and we get back together again.  I go out and buy an expensive hotel with hot tub and a pool and we have a great night.  I said things like I know I truly love her now after being with another girl it had made it clear to me and that I will take her anywhere she wants and do the things she wants to do.

The next few days she doesn't text and I find out she went to six flags with yet another guy. At this point we had expressed vows of love and never hurting each other ever again so I was really hurt.  Then out of nowhere she says its completely over and that she wants nothing more to do with me.  My favorite dog in the world since I had known since a puppy had just died and I said I needed someone to help me through it.  She ignores me and I proceed to get really drunk and drive around and get a dui.  At this point I'm heartbroken and I text her that I need her or I don't think I can live right now.  I had a stash of powerful sleeping pills that I was planning to take to kill myself not only because of her but because of my life situation.  She comes over to my house under the pretense of trying to help but goes into my room and steals the pills and runs out of the house.  I chase her telling her to give them back.  She lies saying she threw them in the bush even though I know that's not true because I looked everywhere and then she tries to get into her car.  I laid down underneath the car and said she would have to run me over if she wanted to leave or give me back the pills or talk to me.  She proceeds to call the cops on me for suicide threats and the cops come over and demand I take an ambulance ride to the hospital because I said I had drank two beers and she had told them I was threatening suicide.  I get out that night as the blood and urine tests show that I had minimal amounts of alcohol in my system like I said and no other drugs and I lied about the suicidal thoughts.  The next few days are volatile switching between me saying I still love her and hate her at the same time.  She ends up blocking me on everything.  So I'm left here alone but I can't help but feel this feelings of anger and revenge for her calling the cops on me knowing that at 17 I was a victim of extreme police brutality which almost killed me because I went around town on lsd telling everyone I was god and you don't tell a cop your god because they think they are gods and they chased me down and beat the shit out me.  Now I know I probably need help and many would suggest a therapist but I tried therapy once and after the fourth session I felt like I was my therapists therapist as we would talk about his relationship with his wife and what not and he was fascinated by me.  I don't know what to do.  I just feel robbed and many would probably say just walk away and move on but I'm finding it hard as she betrayed me and stole from me.  I really do still love her after everything but I know we can't be together at this point after everything has happened but I can't stop thinking about it.  I don't think I'm a bad person and all my friends warned me of this from the beginning and I just feel stupid.  There's way more but I don't know how to put a two year relationship into one post.",2019-07-07 18:08:23,7,1,relationship_advice

168,ca9u9x,HoneyBunChloe,I’m thinking about telling my partner of 3 years whom I have 2 children with that he should have sex with/see other people.,"Me and him have had a similar conversation before due to the fact that we have had sex about 8 times in the last year. After I gave birth to our second child my drive dwindled down to nothing. He frequently tries to get me in the mood but it ends up just making me angry and/or uncomfortable. I’ve looked for advice from my psychiatrist, counselor, mother, I even had bloodwork done to see if it was a hormonal imbalance but it’s all normal. The kicker is that I’m 18 and he’s 19. Before our son (second child) we were always in the mood but now I feel like I’m holding him back and in the process he’s making me feel extremely uncomfortable. I’ve told him that I don’t like it and I push him away but it’s a daily occurrence. I just don’t know if I can keep dealing with it. He flat out refuses to leave me because of our sex life saying “it doesn’t matter to me”.",2019-07-07 18:06:40,10,1,relationship_advice

I told her I wasn’t sure if we could cancel it and she said “well then go with someone else”. I told her that making a decision like this through text and not even consulting me as I’m part of this trip too was inconsiderate.

170,ca7akh,sapajul,I ( 30M) was treated like a dog by my girlfriend ( 36F),"First you'll have to excuse me for my broken English.

For context, I've been in a long distance relationship with her for 2 years, we visit each other every 15 days, in some occasions for over a week. She is a lawyer and after a year together my father hired her for a legal issue he needed solved, in short, she didn't fulfilled the required documents on time and my family was obviously upset, and due to the relationship with me, my family decided not to take any action towards her. During all this process I decided and asked to be left out in case anything didn't happen as planned, and everyone agreed. 

A few weeks ago her daughter (12F) had and event in my city and since she is having some economical issues for the last couple of months, she asked if I could cover her expenses, and I complied. We agreed to a hotel room for 3 to avoid running into my family. When the day came, it turns out the hotel wasn't really needed since the school was providing one for the kids and parents, and she knew beforehand. 

The first day after spending the whole afternoon with her and the rest of the kids and parents, and taking her to a nice restaurant of her choice, her daughter decided to spend the night with her friends in the school provided rooms. My girlfriend went back with me to the hotel. At the hotel we talked about different topics and after failing to find a movie to watch, we proceed to have sex, which felt like doing it with a cheap prostitute, she was totally out of it, like just doing it for as a duty. The next 2 days her daughter shared the room with us and I had to use the tiny second bed the hotel provided, while they shared the king size main bed. 

When I confronted her about how I felt, she said she didn't do anything wrong and that the mood wasn't right that night.",2019-07-07 14:18:15,3,2,relationship_advice

I have moved since and have a toddler and baby now. We don't see eachother that often . I went home for a few days with my kids.

Especially because my closest sister is in high school age I think I was just really reminiscing to myself in those days. Having kids young forced me to grow up.

My SO picked us up today and honestly I feel so depressed and lonely. I can't stop crying. I don't know why I get this way whenever I leave their place after visiting a few days. It's like I have to readjust to my current life, and things just feel very dismal. I don't really notice myself really hating my current day to day life, in fact usually there are quite a few things I enjoy more now that I don't live with my parents as my mother was always very controlling and hard for me to grt along with.

173,ca9shx,LittlePoco,Do I (29F) accept a wedding present from my biological father (50-something M)?,"There's a little history you need to know before answering this question, and I need to have some objective eyes looking at this, because I'm too biased at this point to really know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents divorced when I was entering into high school. The divorce process wasn't easy on either of us (brother), because of custody battles and I ultimately chose to live with my mother. Throughout the entire divorce and afterwards, my mother painted my biological father in a very negative and toxic light. That tainted my relationship with him and we basically cut ties from each other. Looking back on it now, clearly my mother should never have let those toxic feelings trickle down to us kids, but that's in the past and there's not much I can do about it now other than forgive. 

&amp;#x200B;

During this time of ""estrangement"", I never received a Happy Birthday or really any acknowledgment of my existence from my biological father. Who knows, maybe he tried to reach out to me via my mom and she kept it from me. Or maybe he never tried to reach out at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Halfway through college, my biological father reached out to me and we got dinner. During this entire time, my mother and stepfather waited out in the parking lot of the restaurant, just in case things might take a left turn I came out in tears or whatever. Dinner was super civil, I wanted to put the past behind me, and we both came out of it wanting to improve our relationship and make up for that lost time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then my brother got caught with weed. He inadvertently threw me under the bus (I'm guessing he was too scared to rat on friends, and he's definitely apologized many times for it since, I've forgiven him and frankly I don't really care), and my biological father was ready to take me to court over it. Honestly, everything that transpired during this time is really fuzzy... I recall my aunt (from my mom's side-- we're big gossipers within the family) saying that my biological father was going to sue me or something along those lines. Again, not sure how true that is, but what I do know for a fact is that all those plans we made to better our relationship when we met up at the restaurant went down the drain. The biological father's side of the family really painted me as a bad influence and again cut off all ties with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a close relationship with my brother and he told me recently that our biological father wants to give me a wedding present, as we are his only kids and I'm ultimately still his child (okay...). I only invited my brother to the wedding; I did not invite the biological father or his wife. On the one hand, I think a gift is a gift, why not. On the other hand, I wonder if accepting this gift is symbolic of opening my life to him, and if it is, is that what I want? I'm not sure if it's the whole case of, fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. Or is this the story of a man who's gotten wiser in his old age and starting to realize there may be actions in his life that he regrets? I don't know what to do and some advice would be greatly appreciated.",2019-07-07 18:02:40,2,1,relationship_advice
174,ca9rcq,BeautifulSalt15000,Should I reach out?,"I don’t really know if this is the right sub so sorry in advance. My ex dumped me 5 months ago and I haven’t talked to her since then. I deleted her number so I would never have an urge to text her. Almost a month ago I was driving and she was intently looking at me midturn even though I acted like I wasn’t paying attention. I don’t really understand what this meant but it has made me fall back into a hole of missing her ever since it happened. I know she is the one that should be reaching out, but her social anxiety is so bad that I can’t imagine her doing that. She probably thinks I’m extremely mad which wouldn’t help that either. Should I just try texting her and seeing what she says? Should I wait and reach out on her birthday next month? Or should I just wait until the off chance I run into her in public again and try saying hi?

Anyway the break up was honestly really complicated and I honestly still have no idea what I even did. I can only imagine she has just been stressed over her classes and reached a breaking point. If things actually worked out with us talking again I would just assume the no contact period gave us both some much needed space.",2019-07-07 18:00:05,2,1,relationship_advice
175,ca9qlb,help0310,Tips on how to maintain my (21M) LDR with my girlfriend (22F)?,"This is a throwaway account.

My girlfriend, who I met in school, and I have been dating for nearly a year. We are very close with each other and we do everything together, We are pretty much soulmates. We are just so comfortable with each other and love each other so much. We have plans on eventually marrying and living happily ever after. Our parents love us and everything is going well when we are together. We lived with or at least close to each other at college ever since we started dating. However, I will be going back to the college soon and will as a result, live about 2 hours away from her.

We did not have to worry about LDR until summer break. During summer break, I live about an hour away from her. We go visit each other's houses nearly every weekend, sometimes even during the week. However, every time I leave her or she leaves me to go back home, she feels very empty, as do I. She cries every time and says that she misses me especially since she lives alone. Sometimes, she has mental breakdowns and cannot help but try to self-sabotage the relationship, which I discourage. We are each other's everything. Us not being next to each other hurts her and she goes back into this phase. This is just a phase and she snaps out of it eventually. I do my best to keep in contact with her, whether by video chatting, calling, or texting. But again, me not being there hurts her. We love each other so much and I tell her that the LDR is temporary. We will work hard with our careers and in a year or two, we will be close to each other again. When I go back to college in a few weeks (she graduated), I want her to feel better and get used to the long distance.

So I need advice on how to make it easy for her so she does not have to experience mental breakdowns. The self-sabotaging is just a phase and is something she sometimes cannot help with. Deep down, she does not mean it and she does it because she loves me so much and I love her the same. She just misses me so much. We definitely plan to communicate with each other as much as possible. She plans on seeing me every weekend if she can. I just want to ensure that the relationship will survive the school year. We see so many stories about LDRs not working. We both want this to work and it would be extremely heartbreaking if it does not. She means the world to me and I mean the world to her. We have already gone through so much together.",2019-07-07 17:58:20,4,1,relationship_advice

* Feeling hopeless or apathetic; becoming aloof or distancing myself from others I could stay indoors the whole week and hated people.
* Lots of insomnia.
* I abused Dope.

177,ca9ouc,peaceat54,"I'm 54 and my gf is 57, I want her to change her last name back to her maiden name.","My girlfriend and I met 6 1/2 years ago through POF. I was previously married and divorced twice as had she. I asked her to move into my house after 10 months and we have been living together ever since. She didn't want to sell her house yet because her 20+ year old daughters were still living there which I totally understood. After 2 years of living together I wanted to talk to her about a couple of things that were bugging me. One was the fact that she was divorced but she kept her ex's last name. I said it bothered me to which she replied that it's just a name and that it was such a hassle to change it. I explained that having his last name was something that I wasn't comfortable going into the future with but I didn't want to rock the boat and left it alone. I simply said that I didn't see it being something I wanted for us if we were together into our retirement and 10-20 years into our relationship with her still using her ex's name. I let it go but over the last 6 1/2 years I've brought it up 3 times being turned down every time and me just letting it go for fear of rocking the boat. The other issue that I've had a problem with was her reluctance to make a commitment to our relationship by selling her home and investing that money into my home and making it legally our home. The amount she would invest from the sale of her home would not equal to the half required to make up what my house is worth but I wasn't looking to gain from the situation. I simply wanted for us to make a commitment to each other both financially and emotionally. She refused to sell her house saying her daughters live there. Her daughters were paying a small rent but I felt were taking advantage of the situation. I can see helping them out for a few years but now their boyfriends were living there and the house was getting destroyed with their pets as well. The girls always said that if there was any damage when they moved they would pay for all repairs. Time went on and nothing changed. After 6 years of living in my house repairs were in order to which I didn't have the money to do. Then one day the company I worked for lost a major contract to another company resulting in a wide loss of jobs. I decided that keeping my house was no longer an option and suggested to my gf that we both sell our houses and move to a great beach town a little less than an hour away. She accepted to my surprise and that started the move. She told the girls she was selling the house and they had approx 6mths to find a new place. The girls are both over 25 years old so very much adults. The youngest bought a house which was great but the oldest was leaving it to the last minute. We had bought our new house with mine being sold but she still hadn't sold hers because they were still living there. Neither one helped with the many repairs and both would not pay for repairs now saying ""that's what you get for having tenants"" I got really mad after a very hot day of cleaning up the backyard where there was 28 beer bottles hidden in the knee high grass. When I got home I sent them both a text saying "" Do you girls know what you both would call someone who did this to your place? Pigs is what you would call them and that's exactly what I am calling you both PIGS!!!"" Well that didn't go over very well and it started a major fight with all parties involved. My gf and I broke up and she moved out with only a month and a half before we're suppose to move into our new home together. The short time apart was what we needed to realize we didn't want to be apart. So I went back to her house and helped her fix the place so she caould sell it with absolutely no help from her daughters or their boyfriends. We finalized the sale of her house the week before we moved. I know crazy right??? But we did it and now we are very happy in our new home. The girls and I talk but minimally, they both have their own homes and that's great. 

  So here's the issue that I'm having, recently my gf said to me something along the lines of "" why did you want to move hear, was it to get me away from my family? I said to her that if she only would have sold her place and put the money into my place we wouldn't have had to move. We could have done the repairs needed and put a good chunk on the mortgage leaving us in a very comfortable situation.  BTW we don't have a mortgage on our new house, it's totally paid for. I put in $100,000 more than she did but my goal was to build on our relationship not to profit from it. People who come over to our new home are very envious that we can live mortgage free and live in a great beach town with so much to do and in such a beautiful home. Great turn out right? Well the other day I brought up the subject of her changing her last name back to her maiden name and she is refusing to do it. She says it's too much of a hassle and that it's just a name. To me every time I hear that last name I get like a sinking feeling in my stomach. She said she doesn't want to die with that last name so I said great do it now then. She's telling me that I'm trying to control her by asking her to do this. But this time I'm holding strong that I need her to do this for us. I feel it's a commitment to our relationship. We have had a couple of arguments about it but she is refusing to do it. I told her that I would rather sell this house and separate then live the rest of our lives with her keeping his last name. We are both over 55 years of age and she has been divorced for 7 1/2 years. What should I do??? She is very much a procatinator and so if I leave it alone another 5yrs can go by without a change except that it will continue to bother me a great deal every time I hear her say her full name driving a wedge between us...Help :(",2019-07-07 17:54:14,3,0,relationship_advice
178,ca74uj,throwawayfjfjccizn,I am in love with my girlfriend who I don't want to be with.,"Throwaway because gf uses reddit. Also, English is not my first language, I'm doing my best.

I guess I should give some background info. Me and my gf have been together for over 2 years since the 17th of March, which is pretty long considering I'm 18 and she's 17 (nearly 18).
We met through mutual friends online and were together after about 4 months.

Now me and her have been through a lot. Not going into too much detail, I was her first time, we didn't finish because I wasn't wearing protection (stupid, I know), she told her parents who got very upset and never allowed us out of their sight for a couple months. Eventually they let go a bit as we got older and nowadays it's on a regular basis.

Now she has made a very big deal out of this and has told me numerous times that she wants her first time (aka me) to be the person she wants to stay with forever. I used to not think much of it as I thought this is something that most girls probably wanted.

But recently one of her ex-best friends told one of my friends (who was into her) that she's not interested in long-term relationships but rather a fwb relationship. My friend told me and I started to think. My gf was the second girl I've ever done it with, and if we indeed were to never split, she would be the last too.

For some reason this freaked me out... a LOT. I love her very much and care for her in every way imaginable, but I just don't want my ""body count"" (to say it in a d*****bag way) to stay at 2.

I know this is probably really bad of me to think and I feel really bad for feeling this way so I thought I should ask you guys. Would I be a d*****bag of I were to dump her because I wanted to sleep with other women before being tied down permanently.

The 2nd- 4th year were long distance because of military reasons. If you aren't married you can't follow each other and I didn't want to get married just because of a reason like that. For me, I wanted to live together with someone first for a year or 2 before marrying. SO agreed and now we're finally able live together where military careers do not conflict. We do plan on marrying later. 

We still visited each other often, had vacations together and everything. Probably saw each other 1-2 every month or every other month. So it wasn't like we didn't see each other for months on end until now, where I am still deployed and will be back very soon. 

Honestly I think our sex life is great! Were both open and communicate but this has always been a problem and I've brought it up with him before but he still does it!! I don't know what it is! In person or over the phone. If he's in the mood and I'm not and I say ""No thanks"" ""Sorry not in the mood"". 

HE WILL POUT. 

LEGIT HAVE AN ATTITUDE.

The worst is when he gives me a short ""Okay"" then huff's and puffs dramatically like a child. 

It annoys the DOG SHIT out of me and I've asked him why and all he ever says and CONFIRMS is that he's grouchy about it. Okay, be grouchy but don't act like a baby about it!! It's such a turn off for me, I've ignore him when he pouta so far and just tell him he annoys me when he does that and I'm not obligated to drop my pants whenever. I can honestly say I've given him the silent treatment the rest of the day for it. 

He says he understands but that it's still kinda sucks for him/let down and then still pouts!! I'm not sure if it's because of the distance or he focuses on sex because I'm his first (sexual) encounter?? He's had relationships just not sex so I don't know if it's just him trying to get it all out of his system??? But he's my 2nd so sex isn't that big of a deal to me. It's great but I don't want to have sex every single day 2-3 times a day!! At this point I'm thinking of trying to go celibate for some time in the beginning of us living together.

181,ca4v67,ThatIsUgandasAss,"Girlfriend (27F) of almost 2 years demanding a proposal this year, am I (27M) unreasonable to be cautious?","Using a throwaway because lots of my friends and colleagues use Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

Myself (27M) and my Girlfriend (27F) have been together for approaching 2 years now. We had both recently got out of similarly long-term relationships just before we got together. At first things were an amazing whirlwind and we swiftly fell for each other, and things remained great for the first year. We moved in together, and even talked about the future - marriage, kids, dog etc. She is extremely keen to be married before she is thirty, while I had no rush to.

We weren't without our ups and downs, and occasionally we had, what were to me, fairly major arguments, as do most couples. At the time I didn't really notice it, but some of these arguments felt extremely out of proportion - I accidentally gave the wrong postcode when directing her and her mother to a cafe, which resulted in her refusing to see or speak to me for 2 days, and us nearly breaking up. We have bickered on-and-off for the past few months, to the point where my family and friends have apparently noticed a change in my mood (I have previously gone through depression, so this worries me a lot)

&amp;#x200B;

In around Jan, she finished her studies and got offered her dream job, with the potential to progress to earn a 6-figure salary however this job was the other side of the country (UK, \~5 hours away). I was approaching the end of my contract, with a possibility of getting a job there later. After a lot of discussion, I encouraged her to follow her dream if that was what she wanted, and that I would support her decision and we would make things work long-distance. 

Sadly, when it came around to me applying for jobs (in my line of work this is only once yearly and is extremely competitive) I didn't get a job in the city she was in, but was offered an excellent job in my second choice city, my home town (\~2.5 hours away). She was extremely upset when I told her and spent a few days very tearful, before starting to talk about quitting her job. When discussing this I didn't really feel it was appropriate for me to say ""quit your job for me and move here"", and my unwillingness to tell her what she should do again became a point of contention.

&amp;#x200B;

A month or two later and she has now resolved things with her work, and has the possibility to transfer to my city within the next year! We talk about renting a flat/house in the city, and how excited we are to finally be back in the same city.

&amp;#x200B;

She has spoken to a lot of her friends and colleagues, several of whom have said ""Do not move until he proposes"", ""Don't move without a ring on it"". She seems to have taken this idea and ran with it, bringing up weddings nearly every day, sending both me and my mother Pinterest boards of wedding dresses etc. It feels like the only interactions we have are her bringing up weddings.

&amp;#x200B;

Her degree graduation approaches and she is adamant that I have to ask her family permission to marry her at this graduation. This makes me a little uncomfortable because of a) how public it is and b) how, to me, it would feel like trying to make her day more about me. After I discuss my reticence, she goes cold and sulks, even threatening to leave straight after her graduation (we were going to spend a couple of days together afterwards). 

&amp;#x200B;

This whole weekend has felt cold and distant and reminiscent of previous arguments, which has started to play in my mind and make me doubt things.

&amp;#x200B;

We have had further talks about it, but again it seems to boil down to her feeling that I have to propose because she is moving.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel extremely pressured into this decision, am I being unreasonable in having some concerns about it, and not feeling obliged to propose because she is moving?",2019-07-07 09:01:03,10,5,relationship_advice

Not true!!!,"So here’s the deal I have this friend called Steven been friends since the start of highschool we are now 22 his new girlfriend whom I shall nickname “heedthebaw” has been feeding him lies about me I’m absolutely baffled it’s hilarious really, when Steven told her about me she’s been saying I chased her with a knife out of anger because her friend started calling me names apparently this was years ago. 

Steven called me a week ago and told me all this he hasn’t even questioned it he GENUINELY believes it he said that’s incredibly messed up and he would like to speak with me in person I tried to explain on the phone but he shut me down. I messaged his gf heedthebaw about this and she said “shut up pancakes” then blocked me 🤨 don’t even ask but this gets worse yesterday I bumped into a friend of Stevens called mike everyone calls him big mike he’s quite a scary bloke he threatened me violently in public it was embarrassing and overwhelming I kept repeating I did not do this then he pinned me against a wall, a passer by broke it up and he just walked away felt so attacked. This is all just ridiculous and it’s gotten out of hand, I honestly don’t recall chasing anyone with a knife.

183,ca9k0k,BleakTee,Changing your last name after wedding!,"Hello! I'm trying to figure out more people opinion's on what they did with their last names. 

I am a bride getting married in November! I still havent decided what I want to do exactly. I see the pros and cons to each and every situation and just havent found the right ""fit."" 

What did you do? Did you hyphenate your last names and regret it later? 

My current last name is special to me and something I've always loved. My fiances last name is also very cool but there are a lot of individuals with his last name. I've always been one that thought of a name as a personal brand. 

Keeping my last name: I dont have to deal with paperwork but I also dont get to have the same last name as my ""new"" family and future kids. I think I'm least excited about this idea but I love the idea that I wouldn't have to change myself just because I'm getting married. 

Taking his last name: I feel like this is always a safe option for obvious reasons. However, I'd love to keep my last name to some degree. In my state, changing your middle name to your last name is not a marriage name change and will cost us an additional 150 dollars. (Bullshit!) I'd also be giving up the professional career that ""Tee X"" has worked really hard to achieve. BUT itd be super easy for legal documents and for people to understand. 

Hyphenated last name: I love this idea because it's the best of both words. It's an ode to my family but shows everyone that I am committed to my new family with my husband. We also have 2 very short one syllable last name (total characters has would be 10). I recently read that people choose a last name for you (often incorrectly) and it's a nightmare for anything legal. 

What are your experiences with a hyphenated last name? Did you opt out of it and just take your husbands? Please let me know!",2019-07-07 17:43:17,7,1,relationship_advice
184,ca9jpt,TheFatalBagel,Should I get into a soon-to-be long distance relationship?,"I’m wondering what people’s opinions are on getting into a relationship that will soon become long distance.

I (M21) came out of a relationship just after Christmas, and as I’m planning on moving abroad, I told myself I’d just stay single and not risk getting interested or involved with anyone. However a while later some friends started joking about someone (F20) being good for me, and soon after we ended up talking daily. We’ve been friends for two years and during term time were seeing each other every day at various events and when studying (not for the purpose of seeing each other, but just similar lifestyles).

Things have been going really well, but soon we’ll be at least a full day’s travel away rather than a 20 minute walk. We’ve been seeing each other ‘properly’ for a couple of months, but nothing is official yet because we’ll both move to different countries within a month and there is some definite apprehension about keeping it going and committing so heavily to a relationship so early on.

What do you think? Is it a good idea and worth the risk or not? (thanks in advance for any advice, and for reading my first proper post on Reddit)!",2019-07-07 17:42:37,0,1,relationship_advice

He clearly don't want to stay friends, but my SO is fighting to make him understand while becoming super stressed. While he's saying disrespectful and toxic. 

I told her countless times that she is just hurting herself and she can't move on, but it seems that she just can't stop the cycle, I'm not sure what to tell her, and I'm not sure if it's just the fact that she can't move on, or something more deeper then that becuase something similar happend to her before with her first bf.

I have never been in this situation before but is that true???? bc she swears she has until September first to do it. No she is not blood related to the kids. Everyone is sure the ex ran back to her ex husband to get pregnant bc she has other kids with him.

189,ca9hka,chihebtec3,I'm in deep need of help,"try to focus on this one please.

So I met my girlfriend about a year ago, there was nothing serious at that time, actually we were talking about getting in a love relationship but we both were too afraid to do it. so we kinda kept on the friends thing. to make it easy for reading I'm going to call this girl Bouran.

After a while I met another girl, (her name is Dhouha) which I had a wild relation with her that lasted about 2 months, after those two months I felt I'm doing something wrong and I should be with Bouran because I was always thinking about her and missing her. 
so I left Dhouha because we didn't have any much of feelings together.

after a week or so, I called Bouran again and we met. she was crying when we met because she also got into another relation with someone who is 15 years older than her and she couldn't find any reason to leave him.

after a while she realized that's not going to work out with her boyfriend so leaves him finally. FYI I always to tried to make things work out between them.

when kept on meeting for about two weeks, I don't know if you can call that dating because after those two weeks we took a decision and we are finally a couple. 

long shot story, I fell in love, and I'm sure she did too.  we had a very great time full of joy and happiness. (I still have our pictures on my phone)

here's the twist. there was this one night, we were supposed to meet up and go for a date, I actually made a present for her that night and I was very excited to give her the present.
I call her on the phone and she says she can't go out because she's feeling tired.
I said it's alright maybe we'll go out another day.
since that night, everything changed about our relation, we no longer talk like we used to nor meet like we used to.
after exactly 25 days, she calls me at 4AM crying and saying she cheated on me with an old friends she knew from 6 years ago. she told me about that night she told me she's tired, she went out with this friend and she found herself kissing him. and that she kept on crying every night since.

I honestly didn't know what to do, I said since she had the courage to confess, maybe she deserves a second chance, and that's what I suggested, I told her if we both try to make this work out and fix what's broken I'm willing to forgive and forget. and than she says that she doesn't deserve me and we need to break up  because she's blaming herself for what she did.

191,ca9frv,smokegetsinyoureyez,How to casually tell people I know that I'm in a relationship,"So, I'm (24F) in a relationship with a guy I love (25M). We've been dating for a few months, and it's my first relationship.

However, I'm having trouble telling people that I am seeing someone, i.e. telling friends and co-workers that I have a boyfriend. It has nothing to do with me being ashamed of him or anything like that. I'm a shy and private person, and I can't seem to find a way to casually/naturally tell people that I'm in a relationship. It's not a huge problem, but I recently encountered a small problem because of it.

A co-worker (25M) and I started texting, and he kind of invited himself to an event I wanted to attend (I did not explicitly invite him, I was intending on going with my boyfriend). Instead of telling him straightforwardly that I'm going with my boyfriend, I did not tell him anything (dumb move, I know), and hoped he would forget about the event. Basically, he's not aware I have a boyfriend, because I never told him, he didn't ask, and it never came up in a conversation.

My co-worker did not mention the event until the day before, when he asked me if I planned on going, and told me that he'd tag along if I went. So my options were -- 1) telling my co-worker ""Sorry, I'm going with my boyfriend""; 2) telling my co-worker ""I'm going with my boyfriend but you can come too""; 3) lying to my co-worker and telling him I'm not going, but actually going with my boyfriend; 4) Going with my co-worker; 5) Not going at all. All of these options were not ideal... and Options 1) 2) or 5) were probably more morally sound.

I ended up talking to my boyfriend about it, and he told me he wouldn't mind it if I went with my co-worker, so that's what I ended up doing, although I felt kind of bad about it. I would've felt bad with any of these options, and I didn't want to flake on my co-worker as he's super nice, and then make things awkward at work.

After hanging out with my co-worker, I STILL haven't told him that I'm dating someone. The more I wait, the harder it gets because it would make it seem like I was hiding that fact. If I explicitly tell him that I have a boyfriend out of nowhere, it would sound like I'm assuming he likes me, when he most probably does not.",2019-07-07 17:33:46,1,1,relationship_advice

I'm sorry to hurt you, but I'm not going to continue a relationship that I don't see as my forever, I'm sorry I don't feel that way with you. I didn't feel what I needed to feel when I met you. "" 

I told her in the begining to take it slow because she'd only been separated from her ex husband for 8 months and the divorce was just finalized less than 2 months ago, but she pursued the relationship. She said she loved me first.   

A few months ago, I commented on a female co-worker's picture, but it wasn't inappropriate. I just asked her was it busy tonight because I thought about picking up a shift. Then my ex said ""You're just like my ex husband."" Then she blocked me on Facebook Messenger and unfriended me. Then she apologized, added me back and unblocked me. But this time after she left me, I told her to block and unfriended me because I can't do it to her because I love her so much, but she didn't. 

TL;DR Why would she hug me, kiss me, look me in my eyes and say she loved me, then break up with me via Facebook Messenger 3 hours later?

I'm concerned about ruining the friendship as I feel a friend is what she really needs at the moment. To give you a bit of background information, her ex isolated her and then proceeded to mentally and sexually abuse her. They eventually broke up, and she had a couple of messy relationships and one night stands before attempting suicide and being hospitalised. She has now been diagnosed with BPD. She has explained to me that due to everything that's happened sex has no real meaning to her.
I'm getting mixed messages from her. One minute she's saying that we've never really discussed what our relationship is, the next she's telling me about some guy she's talking to on a dating app. She tells me people need to be more honest about there feelings, but will then proceed to say how she spent the night round some guys house. I'm really confused if she's attempting to hint at me to ask her out.
From everything she's told me it sounds like she pretty much falls in love with any guy who's nice to her and says he likes her. I don't want her to feel like she has to date me just because I like her. 
I'd personally prefer to give her time to heal, but she started a relationship with another guy and it hurt to find that out. The relationship is rocky at best, so I'm trying to figure if I should ask her on a date once they break up.",2019-07-07 17:31:18,3,1,relationship_advice

so it's been 2 weeks since i posted.

i talked to my bf the day after and basically said what everyone else already commented and what i was thinking. no, i didn't secretly record her because that didn't sit right with me. i told him her behavior was making me super uncomfortable and that he needed to set boundaries with her asap, or i wasn't going to put up with it anymore. i was fucking pissed while telling him this and he got the message. he texted her in front of me and even let me read it. i was satisfied and very relieved. felt like i could finally breathe.

best friend came over a few times and was very nice to me. she wasn't being inappropriate even once, very respectful of the boundaries we had set. when we were alone she was the same girl as when we were all together. total 180. great. i was sooo glad and happy. thought she got the hint.

skip to yesterday. boyfriend is in the shower and left his phone in his pants on the floor. phone keeps vibrating and im getting annoyed. i grab his phone, all the messages are from best friend. there are pics of them fucking, a video i didn't watch and a lot of lovey dovey messages. i scrolled back and it went back to at least 2 months ago until i had enough and had an emotional breakdown. serious plans together, honestly i never came even came up in their conversations. he came back from the gym last night. we were going to have sex after he got out of the shower. and he had been fucking here minutes before he came home. 

im staying with a friend for a while. had to take work off today because im a total wreck. honestly im still in shock, i seriously can't comprehend what's going on. haven't responded to any of bfs messages but he knows i know, he hasn't said anything after he realized it i think. well this confirmed for me im not as desirable as i thought, funny how i genuinely believed he chose for me. i cant even start to explain how shit i feel. started drinking but luckily i have my friend here who is taking care of me, bless her.

198,ca9dhj,peaceat54,I want her to change her name back to her maiden name.,"My girlfriend and I met 6 1/2 years ago through POF. I was previously married and divorced twice as had she. I asked her to move into my house after 10 months and we have been living together ever since. She didn't want to sell her house yet because her 20+ year old daughters were still living there which I totally understood. After 2 years of living together I wanted to talk to her about a couple of things that were bugging me. One was the fact that she was divorced but she kept her ex's last name. I said it bothered me to which she replied that it's just a name and that it was such a hassle to change it. I explained that having his last name was something that I wasn't comfortable going into the future with but I didn't want to rock the boat and left it alone. I simply said that I didn't see it being something I wanted for us if we were together into our retirement and 10-20 years into our relationship with her still using her ex's name. I let it go but over the last 6 1/2 years I've brought it up 3 times being turned down every time and me just letting it go for fear of rocking the boat. The other issue that I've had a problem with was her reluctance to make a commitment to our relationship by selling her home and investing that money into my home and making it legally our home. The amount she would invest from the sale of her home would not equal to the half required to make up what my house is worth but I wasn't looking to gain from the situation. I simply wanted for us to make a commitment to each other both financially and emotionally. She refused to sell her house saying her daughters live there. Her daughters were paying a small rent but I felt were taking advantage of the situation. I can see helping them out for a few years but now their boyfriends were living there and the house was getting destroyed with their pets as well. The girls always said that if there was any damage when they moved they would pay for all repairs. Time went on and nothing changed. After 6 years of living in my house repairs were in order to which I didn't have the money to do. Then one day the company I worked for lost a major contract to another company resulting in a wide loss of jobs. I decided that keeping my house was no longer an option and suggested to my gf that we both sell our houses and move to a great beach town a little less than an hour away. She accepted to my surprise and that started the move. She told the girls she was selling the house and they had approx 6mths to find a new place. The girls are both over 25 years old so very much adults. The youngest bought a house which was great but the oldest was leaving it to the last minute. We had bought our new house with mine being sold but she still hadn't sold hers because they were still living there. Neither one helped with the many repairs and both would not pay for repairs now saying ""that's what you get for having tenants"" I got really mad after a very hot day of cleaning up the backyard where there was 28 beer bottles hidden in the knee high grass. When I got home I sent them both a text saying "" Do you girls know what you both would call someone who did this to your place? Pigs is what you would call them and that's exactly what I am calling you both PIGS!!!"" Well that didn't go over very well and it started a major fight with all parties involved. My gf and I broke up and she moved out with only a month and a half before we're suppose to move into our new home together. The short time apart was what we needed to realize we didn't want to be apart. So I went back to her house and helped her fix the place so she caould sell it with absolutely no help from her daughters or their boyfriends. We finalized the sale of her house the week before we moved. I know crazy right??? But we did it and now we are very happy in our new home. The girls and I talk but minimally, they both have their own homes and that's great. 

  So here's the issue that I'm having, recently my gf said to me something along the lines of "" why did you want to move hear, was it to get me away from my family? I said to her that if she only would have sold her place and put the money into my place we wouldn't have had to move. We could have done the repairs needed and put a good chunk on the mortgage leaving us in a very comfortable situation.  BTW we don't have a mortgage on our new house, it's totally paid for. I put in $100,000 more than she did but my goal was to build on our relationship not to profit from it. People who come over to our new home are very envious that we can live mortgage free and live in a great beach town with so much to do and in such a beautiful home. Great turn out right? Well the other day I brought up the subject of her changing her last name back to her maiden name and she is refusing to do it. She says it's too much of a hassle and that it's just a name. To me every time I hear that last name I get like a sinking feeling in my stomach. She said she doesn't want to die with that last name so I said great do it now then. She's telling me that I'm trying to control her by asking her to do this. But this time I'm holding strong that I need her to do this for us. I feel it's a commitment to our relationship. We have had a couple of arguments about it but she is refusing to do it. I told her that I would rather sell this house and separate then live the rest of our lives with her keeping his last name. We are both over 55 years of age and she has been divorced for 7 1/2 years. What should I do??? She is very much a procatinator and so if I leave it alone another 5yrs can go by without a change except that it will continue to bother me a great deal every time I hear her say her full name driving a wedge between us...Help :(",2019-07-07 17:28:22,4,1,relationship_advice

He can’t really express his feelings into words well and he’s never felt like this before, so he doesn’t know what it means. Has anyone else felt this before? Does this mean he doesn’t love me as much anymore, but just doesn’t know how to articulate it? Maybe he’s scared to go through pain and is desperately trying to hold on?",2019-07-07 13:42:03,3,2,relationship_advice
200,ca57ze,I_Is_Batman,Ex hooking up with others,"To give a little recap: 

Dated this girl for almost 3 years, around the mid way point is where things got shakey. She had left me for another guy, but then got back with me after a short time period. As much as it hurts me to say this, she ended up leaving me for that guy 2 more times since then. It was always the same guy, and idk why but I never understood why she did what she did. 

The second time it happened was because I was feeling to insecure about it ever happening in the first place so I broke it off. Week later I find out she went back to the same guy. After months of begging me back, we slowly ended up getting back. However, the third time she would be the one to leave me. Her reasons being that I need to grow, and so does she. Never did I think she would go back to that guy again, yet that is exactly what she did. 

Now I don’t know how I ever got back with her after the 3rd fucking time but I did, up until she left to another city for work (training till October). Two days in the new city and she breaks up with me, out of the blue. Telling me how I’m not the one for her, she isn’t stable, etc.,  it’s been 3 weeks since the breakup, and just yesterday she reached out to me. We talked for a bit and she told me she’s already been sleeping around. She has hooked up with 3 guys already by going out to bars or what not. 

The breakup has always been hard on me even after all that has happened. I don’t even know if this is the right sub for this, but how can I move on from this? I feel like I’m in a black hole. Everyday is so hard for me. I try to talk to others on tinder or distract myself but everyday I think of her, only to find out she’s been going out and seeing others. 

I feel I’m weak af and that I will never get out of the pain I’ve been in, it’s been over a year since the first big bump and yet here I am still fucking my life up over it.",2019-07-07 09:55:39,6,3,relationship_advice
201,ca9cpk,DreadfullyBIzzy,How to make sure my (22F) Grandpa (70s M) knows our baby is not named after him?,"So this is a bit complicated. My grandpa and I don’t have a good relationship. He was very cruel to me when I was a child, and had no respect for boundaries, even when my siblings and I became teenagers and adults. We had a falling out a few years back when he started treating my little sister horribly. He’s also a textbook narcissist. We went several years with no contact, but my husband and I recently moved out of state. I missed my grandma and wanted to see her again, and since Grandpa wouldn’t allow her to see us without him, we went on a few outings with the two of them before we moved out of state.

I’m pregnant now. Here’s the tricky part: my husband’s middle name is the same as my Grandpa’s first name. James. I didn’t know this until after my husband and I started dating, because my grandma calls him Jim, and we were never allowed to call him “Grandpa Jim”. That was too disrespectful. We had to call him “Grandpa (last name)”.

He has a brother. My uncle. He was very kind and involved in our lives growing up. I have a lot of fond memories of my uncle David. I would like to honor him by naming our son after him. But my grandpa hates his brother.

The name we’re considering is James David. My husband’s middle name and my uncle’s first name. But my grandpa will automatically think that James is honoring him. This is NOT the case. I don’t want my grandpa to think we’ve named our son after him. How can I make it undeniably clear to my grandpa that we are NOT naming our child after him? I don’t want to come across as rude in telling him this, but I also can’t have him going around to other family bragging that his grandchild was given his name when that’s not the case.

Tl;dr: grandpa has same first name as my husband’s middle name. Grandpa is a class A asshat. We want to name our baby my husband’s middle name. How do I tell gramps that the name is not meant to honor him in any way because he’s not a good person and I hardly even consider him family?",2019-07-07 17:26:26,7,0,relationship_advice
202,ca9c1a,Moon_Night_Theatre,I'm (25f) pregnant with a miracle baby. Husband (27m) wants a paternity test. I want a divorce.,"My husband and I have been together 3 years, married for 1. We met in college and were part of the same circle of friends, but had very different lifestyles so didn't interact so much. After graduation, I ended up moving to the city that he had taken a job in, we reconnected, and hit it off. Our marriage has been great.

The thing that's relevant here is that I had cancer as a child. Chemo and radiation effectively cured me, but I was told that due to my age at the time (13) and the aggressive treatments, I am effectively infertile without medical intervention. Well, I'm four months pregnant, found out last month (I have very irregular periods so I didn't realize). I didn't know I even wanted a child until now, I always assumed it was near impossible. My husband wanted children but had accepted my situation. I want this baby more than anything I thought possible. 

I told him last month. At first he was ecstatic, went to every appointment with me, he's been posting constantly on some subreddit for dads to ask advice. So it blindsided me utterly when he sat me down last night and said that he wants a paternity test. Apparently they can do them early on now. He says it's not that he doesn't trust me, but what the fuck else reason could there be?

I am staying with my sister now. He's blowing up my phone with texts and emails saying that ""any guy would ask the same"" and that ""it's just that we both know you getting pregnant was unlikely, any guy would be suspicious""

I need to know if I'm overreacting.

Edit: I will be getting the test. It isn't covered by insurance so I will have to pay out of pocket, but that's ultimately something I can handle. 

Tldr: was told by doctors that I was infertile, I'm pregnant, husband says he wants a paternity test because my pregnancy is ""medically unlikely.""",2019-07-07 17:24:50,54,1,relationship_advice
203,ca9bue,throw-it-away96,Husband being sneaky,"Obligatory long time lurker, first time poster, made a throw away for obvious reasons.

To start I (23f), have been with my husband (23m) for almost 4 years now, we got married in November. When we first got together he was kind of a hippie, go with the flow kind of guy, and I was coming out of a long term relationship where I was held to extremely high standards. My ex's family was extremely religious and already had opinions of me based on my appearance and I was always expected to do everything right, and never act my age (19 at the time). My current husband and I had been best friends for a very long time and he finally moved back to my area right as I was leaving my ex. 

When we started dating I left the house my ex and I had together and my husband and i started couch hopping at friends places, we smoked a lot of weed, we spent most of the day at the skate park boarding and getting high and hanging out with our friends constantly. It got to the point where we were smoking and eating my entire paycheck before the next one came, and we started getting into small arguments with the people we were living with and it became clear we needed to grow up a little and get our crap together. We started looking for houses and finally found one a little out of our price range but all he needed to do was get a job and we would be set. Everyday he said he would look and apply, and everyday I would come home from work and he would be stoned and playing video games. 

At that point I realized maybe my husband wasn't as serious about life as I was and we had too many differences to make this long term. That's when he started talking about wanting a family, and wanting to shape up and get a job, and not be so lazy anymore. So we quit smoking pot together (it's still illegal in our state), and he started applying for well paying jobs. We had our oldest daughter in 2017, life was good, we had moved to a more affordable house, and life was good. In between having our oldest and getting pregnant with our youngest, we got a babysitter one night and decided to smoke a little pot just for old times sake and to enjoy a night kid free. It was like in that moment he realized how much he missed getting high. I caught him sneaking pot about 3 times by the time we had our youngest daughter. He promised every time that he wouldn't lie or sneak, or smoke at all anymore. But he has kind of a selfish nature, where if he wants to do something he just will, the consequences dont matter enough and he will just do what he wants. So now our child is 9 months old, I hadn't caught him smoking or lieing about it in a long time, and I thought hey why not reward this situation and we can smoke some together again and in a way he wont have to lie or sneak it. Well the friend that we asked to bum us some gave us waaaaay more than we needed, so I was just going to keep the rest hidden away until the next time we wanted to indulge. 

About a week after we smoked together, he can to visit me at work after he had gotten off and his eyes were red and runny, he was clearly stoned. I asked him three times if he had smoked and finally on the third time he stopped denying it and told me he went and smoked with a friend after work. This was only 2 days after having a long deep discussion about how I needed to trust him, and it's not even about the pot, its lieing and sneaking things from me and he promised again that it wouldn't happen. Then 2 days later he shows up to my work stoned. He ended up feeling so bad he had a panic attack and apologized profusely. I told him this was the last chance I had to give and I didnt know what I would do if this happened again, my heart just hurt that he wanted to be high over just being honest with me. 

That brings us to today. Our kids are at a playdate and my husband is helping a friend move, so I have the house to myself to get some cleaning done. I was dusting and decided to check the place where I hid the pot just in case, and low and behold it is all gone. All of it. It was a lot. A couple days ago we had the talk again and I asked him if he had smoked, because it would hurt less to just be honest and tell me then for me to find out he had hid it and lied. He swore he hadn't and he was being honest. 

So what do I do now? How do I bring it up to him that I know he lied? Is there anything I can do to motivate him not to? Am I obviously being niave and this is just who he is and I should leave? He is my best friend and the best father I've ever seen, I feel like he is my soulmate, I just cant deal with being lied to like this anymore. Help me internet strangers.

Tl;Dr- Husband is sneaking and lieing about smoking pot. I told him it was my last straw, and he did it again, what do I do now?",2019-07-07 17:24:24,3,0,relationship_advice

But I’m human and I also can’t help how I feel. And every time I try to talk to him about it he brings up my one night stand and isn’t very compassionate.

207,ca99u0,bestfriendorno,"Best Friend (25M, me: 23F) in a serious relationship practically less than one month after us (1.25yr)."," Using throwaway but hoping he sees this and realizes it is about our friendship.  


So basically this morning at 6AM, I ended up telling him we couldn't be friends anymore and I just feel dead inside. I have no motivation for anything and all I can do seem to do is cry. If I try to sleep, I just have nightmares and am not able to for more than 20 minutes at a time. I will preface this by saying I no longer have any feelings for him anymore.  


Backstory:  
We met in college freshman year as we were living in the same dorm and became really good friends. He had asked me out at the end of winter break and I had said no. We talked about it again at the end of first year and came to the same conclusion.   


Sophomore year, it was brought up again and we practically were a thing even though not officially for about a month and half. During this time, he told me that since freshman year he also had feelings for another girl (we shall call her J) but that his feelings for me were much stronger. I ended up saying no and literally the next day, I find out the two of them have spent their entire day together. I'm personally not that close with her and they really weren't either (or so he has claimed several times for that point in time). Not even a week later during Thanksgiving, he calls me and asks for advice on how to tell her he has feelings. Then during a mutual friends birthday party two/three weeks, he hooks up with literally the one person I have told him I'm not okay with for the past six months. Before this party, he never knew her but knew I wasn't a fan. He asked me for my permission(?) to hook up while telling me he didn't want anyone's opinion to affect his decision. They hooked up.   


The next day, I'm at an amusement park with him and one of my other best friends and later that night he tells me how he couldn't stop thinking about how beautiful I looked the entire day. IDK how but somehow within the week following, I agreed to date him. I now regret that decision. We were together for about 1 year and 3 months. He told me he loved me about a year in.   


During our entire friendship and relationship, whenever I had issues with J, he would always defend her. Somehow I always ended up in the wrong and the one to apologize. I never felt like he was even trying to listen to what I had to say half the point. It felt like to him J was an angel and could never do no wrong. When I talked to him about it, he said he defends everyone but he never defended as intensely or quickly as her. On our first date, he mentioned how much J would have enjoyed it.  


Now when we ended things, we were hoping to remain close friends. I genuinely thought it possible. However, within two weeks after we broke up (end March) I had a suspicion that they were talking and potentially getting together. I recently (this morning) had it confirmed that they are and I think have been now for almost 3 months. I wasn't talking to him for the past month and half but he knew exactly how I felt about all of this and how hurt I would be.   


He claims to not have feelings for her at all during the time we were together but with the timeline, I have a really hard time believing that. With this actions, it's even harder. He tells me that I matter so much to him and he cares about me more than almost anyone else in this world. He said that he wants me to be happy and doesn't want to hurt me. His actions don't line up with his words at all. He said ""There are few things in this world that I want more than for you to be truly happy.""  


I feel like I never even mattered whenever she comes up or I'm around her. In group situations, I felt like he focused on her more.  


I don't know how to go about this situation at all. Please help. I know I have made mistakes but I feel like this shouldn't have happened. He says he blames for me us not being friends anymore but I feel it is his actions that have gotten us to the point where we are?  


TL;DR: Got together with my best friend after 1.5yrs and we lasted about 1.25years. Less than a month later, he got together with someone who with his actions has made me feel terrible. I also don't like her to due to other reasons. But are either of us in the wrong? How do I fix this? What should he do?",2019-07-07 17:19:40,3,1,relationship_advice
208,ca99gk,widdendreamt,My [22F] LDR with bf [22M] is falling apart because he refuses to work on himself.,"I’ve been with my partner for 4 years. We’ve been long distance for the last year. Lived together 2/4 of the years. 

We both have depression and for the last 4 years he has always had an excuse to not get help. 
The last 3 years the excuse was he was too busy, didn’t have time or money. For the most part, I understood this because he would go to school from 7:30-2:30 then go straight to work until like 10/11... then he finally finished school and got his dream job which pays very well. He now works from ~7:30-6 mon-fri. The first three months at the job he said he was waiting for insurance. Now he has insurance and has no more excuses. He literally just doesn’t want to think about it. He doesn’t care enough about his health, or us, or anything at all. He’d literally rather rot away then try. I have tried to talk to him about this but he literally just doesn’t care. I don’t want to leave yet but I already know that’s probably the only option. I’m just posting here out of hope that there may be something I can try to say to him that might get him to realize he needs to try. I was supposed to see him at the beginning of August but I feel like there’s no point anymore. 

TL;DR My partner is really depressed and not trying. Doesn’t care about anything at all. I’ve waited for years through excuses and now there’s no excuses just no will. Desperate for a way to get through to him before I have to give up and leave.",2019-07-07 17:18:40,0,1,relationship_advice

210,ca9950,taterth0t69,Girlfriends (21F) family took me (20M) on vacation had a whole bunch of drama and told her I want to be alone today for my birthday.,"Originally tried to post in r/AITA
TL;DR at the bottom
Just a bit of backstory. 

My girlfriend and I are coming up on two years, her family was nice enough to include me on a vacation to Florida during 4th of July. First few days were great then her sister and her husband, her brother and his wife all came into town. 


Agreement was that we would all rotate who was cooking each evening, but if you cook then you don’t have to clean. The day that my girlfriend and I were cooking we had to bike 2 miles in blistering heat and I had to trek 40 pounds of groceries in my backpack. I was happy to do it because I was appreciative but I was also hoping that her parents would be more impressed at our initiative and willingness to contribute (her mom was saying that we didn’t have to cook, I had said I wanted to, it was the least I could do). Wound up cooking a fantastic meal I tried to help clean up but my girlfriend and her sister kept telling me to sit down and that they had it all taken care of. 

I went to the bedroom nearby to check my email when I overheard their mom saying that she loved how the boys did absolutely nothing, and just left the cleaning up to the ladies (granted her mom and dad didn’t clean up). My girlfriend and her sis stuck up for me saying how I had helped but the mom said she saw me laying down on the couch when she came in and didn’t think that was the case. They told her I was nearby and could hear the convo (I could). Didn’t see her for the rest of the night, wound up blaming the reason for saying what she did on her having drank too much and having cough medicine so she didn’t remember it happening. 


I was relatively quiet the next day or so because I was hurt about what she had said. My girlfriend stuck up for me when her mom noticed I was being quiet and so her mom the next morning when I woke up at 5:45 (did it quite often) to put away the dishes told me I didn’t have to do that and she’s hoping she didn’t make me because of what she had said. Told me she didn’t remember saying it but she was sorry if she did. 

Fast forward to next day, kind of coming out of my shell again after drinking with her brother his wife and the sisters husband. Girlfriend was spending very little time with me even though the first 2 days we were tied at the hip.  When she did come around and see that I was drinking she was telling me that I needed to stop drinking because it’s a family vacation and she didn’t trust me to control myself. Feelings became hurt and so I stopped drinking after having said you don’t have to be as judgmental of me. Her sister turned around and said “Really?!” Almost yelling. 


Girlfriend and I went kayaking that day and she told me about all the stuff I’m doing wrong and how I’m way too self centered (mind you I’ve been helping with anything and everything whenever I can) and how im way too impatient and how she’s been having to wait on me and that I constantly think that my way is the only way. I told her in a stupid impulsive move that I’ve been waiting on her for two years (to get more freedom for her family) and she can’t wait on me for 2 minutes.  


Next day comes around, I asked if anyone wanted to take the kayak out and everyone had said no. I took it out. Supposedly her dad was pissed and said “taterthot69 is going to have the kayak the whole freaking day”. Her sisters husband stuck up for me saying I asked if anyone wanted to use it before taking it out. 


Later I found out that my girlfriends dad and her sister had both been treating her poorly. I expressed concern and frustration that the woman I love was being treated this way. She called them asshole and bitch but I didn’t contribute to it. Fourth of July was this night and so my girlfriend is kind of afraid of fireworks and thinks they’re dangerous. Not irrational. When she was asking her family to be more mindful they got mad at her. I came over to console her then that was that. 


Next day, (mind you I’m frustrated at how she’s being treated yet I’m being told by my girlfriend to smile and wave basically) wake up and see my girlfriend getting along perfectly with her sister and her dad and everyone and is staying away from me. Dinner comes around and we are listening to music, I’m contributing very little to conversations at this point for fear that I say the wrong thing. Decide to open my mouth when Somewhere over the rainbow by IZ came on basically saying I love this song. Her dad starts yelling at me after being 3/4 beers in saying “This song is incredibly important and close to me and the girls I don’t want to hear your opinion or what you think. I want you to SHUT THE FRICK UP.”  ( song was important cause they listened to it when they were young) Meanwhile I’m sitting there basically about to cry because it’s been one thing after another. 

Go back to shutting my mouth hoping my girlfriend would get up from the table and take me outside and console me. But no I had to pretend like everything was okay. Get through dinner, start playing a game called code word. Boys vs girls I was thinking out loud and her sister scoffed at a guess of mine. At the end of the round my guess was actually a valid guess and so I said “see we both didn’t know that was a thing. Interesting right?” She goes on to reply “I know my husband I know he wouldn’t pick something like that” again yelling at me. My girlfriend asked why she was being rude then her sister says “taterth0t69 said I didn’t know everything” 
(mind you another instance occurred with her sister before this trip a few months ago where her sister said I called her a bitch when I didn’t) 
then I hear my girlfriend say “can’t you just pretend to be nice?” and the sister replies with I can pretend but I’m not going to pretend to like him when I don’t”. 


This was after dad yelled at me and now I’m hearing that her sister doesn’t approve of me. Get through board games and start cleaning up and I made a comment trying to be cute/funny saying the eating side of the silverware needs to be up in the dishwasher. (Her dad expressed he liked it like that) we all 3 didn’t have any preference about it but I was trying to be funny. Then girlfriends putting stuff in dishwasher and she said she almost cut herself because of doing it like that and I said yeah I honestly don’t mind either way “I was just trying to kiss (the dads) ass” her mom took offense to that and so my girlfriend turned around and became really sharp at me saying “really?” And didn’t talk to me the rest of the night.


Next day she’s buttered up with her dad sister and mom, I’m staying quiet all day. Gf and I begin to talk saying I’m upset about last night but she goes on to say “You can not play victim to a problem that you created. I was upset that you had the audacity to tell my mother you were kissing ass. That makes you look like a total douche. The other stuff, i get. But i cross the line at attitude/dare i say arrogance expressed towards my mom who even apologized at the thought of hurting you. Their generosity has been extensive. I get that you were hurt. That’s not why i “abandoned you”. I’m not going to be a shoulder to cry on if i feel that you crossed a line”.  She also went onto say that because I was expressing concern of how she was being treated by her family “i think you spend a lot of time talking about how messed up my family is and how unhappy they make you”.


I kept quiet all day and she just bonded with her dad and her sister and mom all day. Go to the airport, get on the plane, she asked me what’s wrong and I had started saying something but then I told her I can’t be the bad guy anymore. I can’t talk about this stuff because I don’t want you to think I don’t love your family because I do. But finally I said that it was because her sister doesn’t like me and doesn’t approve of me, and that it was extremely hard for me to hear last night... she said I need to let it go but I told her that had it been my dad been treating her like that or that my brother was saying anything to that effect that I would immediately get up from the table and take her away because she should not be treated like that. 

She says I think we need to go back to being best friends first and I said I agree I think I need to be alone for a bit and I need some time to myself. She starts crying but I managed to console her and have her know it’s for the better. That was last night and today is now my birthday and I told my girlfriend I don’t necessarily want to see her today. Now I’m sitting on the couch at my brothers apartment writing this out. 
I feel like her family felt they could treat me however they wanted because they paid for me to come along but I don’t think that’s okay. 
What do you think AITA? 

TL;DR girlfriends family paid for me to go on vacation treated her and I like shit. She was okay with it I wasn’t.  I’m upset and told her I need some space the day before my birthday. Now I’m debating about seeing her today.",2019-07-07 17:17:59,13,1,relationship_advice

Fast forward a few weeks - she goes on the post-graduation vacation we were planning with another friend. She initially told me she couldn't afford it before breaking up with me. I did nothing this summer, so that still hurts a lot.

Fast-forward a month - she emails me a whole letter saying she doesn't regret anything that happened between us but apologizes for a lot of the communication issues she had been blaming on me for 3 years. She acknowledged that a lot of those issues fell on her more than me, which had been a source of frustration on my part for a long time. She said she's been working on herself a lot and is feeling a lot better, but that she misses me and the things we used to do. She mentions some things she felt our relationship was lacking - some of which I didn't realize at the time but are completely valid. She closes it out repeating something I said to her: ""that we're soulmates better paired for adult life than college life,"" and says she hopes we can find each other soon. She signed off with ""Love, ...""

I miss her a lot. I'm not sure I still love her the way I did, but I miss her. I sent a reply to that email, some of which criticizing how she treated me during the last few months of our relationship, and some of it discussing how I wish I hadn't made some of the decisions that harmed our relationship.

This was all last month. I've been wanting to text her for a few weeks now. We've been apart for two months but all I want to do is talk to her and see if we're ready to re-approach our relationship. I'm mostly good when I'm with others, but when I'm alone that hole opens right back up. I've been on dates with other women but they weren't what I'm looking for. I find other women to be attractive, but I find few personalities I connect with. I really just think I'm looking for her.

Should I take more time and re-assess this at a later point in life? Would it be harmful to reach out now and just talk and see where we're at; even just to get some answers about why she acted how she did before we broke it off? It seems absurd to go back after just 2.5+ months but maybe we just needed some time off.

**TL;DR**: Girlfriend and I broke up because she needed space. She reached out and took responsibility for things she hadn't in 2+ years, saying she wants to reconnect soon. Can't figure out if I'm ready to reach out or if I should keep playing the single life for now.",2019-07-07 01:52:27,10,17,relationship_advice
213,ca6tq0,Sulph92,I 26m broke my girlfriend's 22f trust. How do I fix this?,"So my girlfriend confided in me something very private a few weeks ago. She told me I was her first for a certain sexual experience, and that I was the first person she felt comfortable doing it with. 

Fast forward a few weeks and I was speaking to her best mate about some stuff, and the topic of sex came up. I blurted out the thing that my girlfriend trusted me with, and like an idiot I didn't even think twice about it or realise the ramifications for it. 

Her best friend told her and now my girlfriend is angry at me and rightly so. 

She said I've taken her consent and violated her trust. I understand that I've done this. I understand that even if that's not my intention, that its still what's happened. 

She said if I want things to work I need to fix this. Problem is, I'm not sure how to fix this. I've apologised to her, I've spoken to her best friend and told them I was in the wrong etc, but apologising and moving on is different to fixing it. 

So, How do I fix something like this? I'm at wits end trying to figure out what I can do. I want to marry this girl and I do not want to lose her over this. I need to prove to her that she can trust me.",2019-07-07 13:28:43,8,2,relationship_advice
214,ca974e,throwmeawayplzzq,Does anyone else smoke weed everyday and no one really knows? Including their wife?,"A little background to see if anyone relates:

So like many others I’m sure, started smoking weed in high school with friends and just kind of never stopped. I’m 25 years old. I’ve been fortunate to have a family member who owns a successful company that always has work to do, so I’ve always done that growing up and now do that full time. My wife knows I smoke frequently but even she, doesn’t really understand how high I am all the time. I don’t smoke before or while I’m at work because I can’t focus. But when I get home, I use those new weed pens and get absolutely stoned.  This is how I start out every day that I’m not working. That’s how I started this Sunday and will continue to smoke for the remainder of the day. If I’m going to see family or anyone really, I will stop smoking about 1.5-2 hours before I leave to let myself come down enough. 

I want to know how many other people smoke like I do and others don’t know, because I’ve been doing it for so long now, it’s just part of my life but sometimes I stop and ask if it’s best left a secret. 

Other than my Wife, my two siblings, and 3-4 friends (that I can rarely see). No one else knows. Like everyone at work and who I see on a daily basis do not know. The real secret to even my wife, because she can’t get high and does not understand, is how high I actually am for my entire time off (and often with her).",2019-07-07 17:13:14,9,1,relationship_advice

We are both adventurous and curious in all aspects of life. We haven't really discussed drugs too much because they aren't a big part of our life, but we occasionally try them when offered. I have told her that I'd like to be together for our first time trying anything new which we both have interest in (experiences or drugs), and I thought she understood that, but recently she was offered to do magic mushrooms with one of her football friends. He said he can get them some next week, and she plans on doing it. I have suspected my girlfriend having a crush on this guy since she first talked about him, and it makes me uncomfortable thinking about them together doing a psychedelic drug, especially for her first time. I have talked to my friends about mushrooms before, and a lot of them say it makes them super horny around the end of the experience, and makes them see people and things in different ways. She has not invited me to join and I don't think she intends to, I don't want her to be alone with this guy for it. We all hang out together occasionally and I have no reason to dislike him, so if I suddenly burst out saying ""I think you have a crush on him, I don't want you two being alone together anymore"" I'd just come off as insecure. I'm unsure if this is considered controlling, because psychedelics seem like a grey area, I just have somewhat strong opinions on them. I believe we should be around each other, or family / trusted friends for our first time trying anything like mushrooms, but I haven't had enough time to trust this guy, and my exclusion makes me even more distrusting of them. I have acted cool around the idea of her doing mushrooms with this guy previously, but now it's ACTUALLY going to happen, and it makes me uncomfortable.

219,ca9556,18416051872615638829,My (21M) ex (21F) created a fake Instagram account about me. How do I get this fake Instagram account taken down?,"I broke up with this girl, let’s call her X, 7 months ago. I recently found out that she had made an Instagram account, with a picture of me, and under the description she trashed me. 

I was only wit her for the short term investment. The only rewarding thing that came out of the relationship was her willingness to do sexually and emotionally satisfy me. The negative attributes of the relationship was that she had no social skills. She had trouble starting up and continuing conversations. She opened up a lot to me and had told me very-personal things about herself, and her last relationship. Her last ex dumped her the night he had taken her virginity, and left her outside alone. Also, about losing her friends, and not being able to openly talk to her family about her problems. She had a lot of issues to begin with, and seemed to really fall in love with me throughout our relationship. 

I’ve been with my ex (current gf) for 4 years, which beats out being in relationship with X for 7 months. So, when my ex came running back to me 6 months ago, I obviously had to take her back. I was in love with my gf, and not X, but X was in love with me. 

In the post it implied I was a manipulating sociopath who mentally and sexually abused her. At the end of a date she was willing to have sex with me. After we would have sex she would have to walk back alone. I couldn’t drive her back, because I had to wake up early for school the next morning. Whenever she didn’t want to have sex with me, I would be upset, because that was the best part of the relationship, but she would give in anyways, even if it was one sided. 

I did have some feelings for her, but that was before my ex (current gf) came back into the picture. So this claim of mental and sexual abuse is a lie. She wouldn’t even have evidence to show it either. 

It is not my fault she fell in love with me and I had no intentions of feeling the same way. I saw our relationship short term when I had to choose between her and my current gf. When I had the opportunity to go back to my ex, who I was actually in love with, of course I dumped X to go with the one I actually loved. 

I did feel a little bad that I dumped her the way her first ex did, which was sleeping with her, then dumping her, and letting her walk home alone. But after she made that fake account trying to call me out I don’t feel bad for her. I want to move on with my girlfriend, and I don’t want this thing to suddenly come up again  in the future. I dumped X and I have no remorse, and my gf thinks I shouldn’t feel bad either. I don’t think I deserve hate for breaking up with someone I don’t love. 

How do I get this post taken down? I had many people report it already, but it is still up for now.

I feel sick. I’ve been with this guy for over 3 years and everything seemed to be going well. We moved intogether at the end of last year.

Today I questioned him about it, not confrontationally or anything and he was just silent. He said he still loved me and he didn’t want to break up but the atmosphere was strange. Then about an hour of silence later he gets up and says he’s going to his parents house for a few days. I start crying and asking what’s wrong or what’s happening and he just says that it’ll break the monotony. I push it further and he said that he’s annoyed by my lack of direction, (I don’t know what I want to do) and that he just wants me to do something. He said maybe we’re just too different and I cried harder. I asked if there was anything we could do to make things work and he just kept saying he didn’t know. He left and he said he’ll come back but I have no idea when. It all felt so cold. I felt like my crying and asking how we could fix it was just boring him. He never hugged me or said anything but bye and left and I don’t know what to do. I don’t have any family or anything to turn to for support.

224,ca90dl,FlyingSaucer327,Me (29F) &amp; my bf (29M) are on the verge of breaking up :(,"**\*LONG POST**

&amp;#x200B;

A little back story: I married my high school sweetheart when I was 14 &amp; he was 17. He was my first bf, first blah blah blah... anyways we were together just shy of 10 years total. We got a divorce because he cheated on me while on deployment. At the time I was willing to work things out so we could move on from it. I understood people make mistake - especially since we were each other's first actual relationship. We grew up together, so I took that into consideration. Anyways, things progressed well &amp; then all hell broke loose. Long story short he continued to cheat behind my back, she got pregnant &amp; of course I just walked out on him. We discussed starting a family for years, but my instincts said ""just wait"". As in love as I was with this man &amp; as badly as I wanted a baby - I still listened to instincts. Oh thank god for that.

&amp;#x200B;

I was absolutely traumatized by the whole situation as you could imagine. I never cheated on him in all the years we were together &amp; I treated him like a king. But more importantly, we were best friends. So I was traumatized. I went into a depression I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. His karma came back to him, because for the years following he was begging for me back because he realized his mistake. But he's crazy lol. I would never... But we did eventually reconnect burly as friends who kept in touch here &amp; there. I didn't &amp; still don't hold a grudge, until I asked him to stop contacting me because it's just mind games that aren't necessary for my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually (somewhat) resurfaced from my dark hole &amp; enrolled in school to get another degree &amp; restart my life (by this time I'm 24). After I graduated I stayed in town to basically ride out the last few months of my lease until I move out of state essentially start a new life. I got a job to make some extra money for the move... This is where I met my current bf. Our relationship went from 0-100 in 30 days &amp; we moved in together when my lease ended. Fast I know but w/e. It was magical lol. He's literally the complete absolute polar opposite of my ex husband &amp; that's what I was going for.

&amp;#x200B;

PRESENT DAY: We've been together for a little over 4 years now &amp; about 8 months ago we moved out of state together. The move itself has been good, but he's become increasingly distant. I'd say over the last year or so the vibe is weird &amp; when we get into arguments he says such hurtful things to me I'm almost left in shock. I'm not an argumentative person at all. I don't yell &amp;I don't say hurtful things. It's just not me. Most recently he told me that I'm insecure &amp; I swear to you that instantly broke my heart. Yes, I'm hard on myself sometimes - but the only time that may spill over into my relationship is maybe when I ask him if he still thinks I'm sexy or attractive.

&amp;#x200B;

He says yes of course, but I ask him that because our sex life has been dead. What else am I supposed to think? How am I supposed to feel? He hasn't been affectionate toward me in so long - unless I try to cuddle with him or lean in for a kiss. At this point I almost feel weird trying to have sex with him because it's like it hits me. If I didn't initiate it would he still want it? I love this man with everything I have. I've been faithful &amp; I genuinely treat him well. He knows that I'll do anything in the world for him, but I'm beginning to feel like I'm so invaluable all around. I recognize that I have a serious fear of being alone &amp; a part of me is wondering if I put up with all of this because of that reason. But more importantly, I feel so alone in my relationship. I don't feel pretty because I never hear it told to me.

A friend of mine, like, really good friend of mine, Ted (not really his name), was in need of a new job. He applied, without my knowledge, to my place of work. I informed my boss of my relationship to Ted. My boss asked if this would impede my ability to supervise, as I would be supervisor to Ted. I said it wouldn't. 

Ted's interview went well. We hired him.

Within a couple months of Ted's being hired, more job positions opened up, with a few new people being hired. At this point, Ted, unfortunately, still had a lot of new-guy tendencies and I had to make sure he was doing his job correctly. 

On top of that, Ted didn't realize he didn't really know what he's doing, and he started giving the newer people unsolicited advice that was the opposite of what they had just learned from me. He and I talked, and while he wasn't happy about it at first, now things seem to be going smoother. 

Then, Ted starts talking about his political beliefs with me. 

I have known Ted for a few years, and I thought I knew his views. Apparently he has developed a few new ones.

He hates feminism. The term and just about everything it stands for.
He hates refugees and think they should just stay in their home country.
He is afraid of losing his white culture to refugees and immigrants.

There's more along this train of thought, but I can't remember more examples right now.

I don't want to spend time with him right now, at work or otherwise. I don't really have a choice about work at the moment. I just need some advice on how to deal with him on a friend level.

227,c9lzkc,helpme19711817817181,FINAL UPDATE I (27f) found out my boyfriend (33m) is not divorced or childless when I told him I was pregnant.,"Short update because I realize it kind of seems like I left you guys hanging. 

First I’d like to address that the pregnancy was not unexpected but not explicitly planned. “Accidental” was not the right word, but I’m aware of how babies are made. I was in a sense trying to get pregnant, but only because my ex lied to me and convinced me he was onboard. I’m not gonna sit here and explain the ins and outs of how I was duped, I was stupid and missed some flags but I absolutely planned on bringing a child into what I expected would be a healthy, safe, loving environment. 

That environment is not real. I am not ready to be a mother under the current circumstances, I am not mentally or emotionally fit to carry out a pregnancy, and I am most definitely not going to put a child through the adoption system. It is just not a guarantee of a good life and I can’t in good conscience do that. For those and other reasons I’ve explained before, I have begun the process of getting an abortion. 

I collected photographs, videos, screenshots of texts, and everything I could find as evidence to show my ex’s wife. I tried to find texts in which he referenced being divorced or just any lies to prove that I’m not at fault, but I heeded yalls warnings to not try and help her or push her too far since I don’t know how she’d receive these news. I simply found her on social media, sent her all the pictures and screenshots, and a short run down of what her husbands been doing for 2 years. It took a day for her to respond but all she said was “thank you” and once I saw that, I blocked her. 

I have not heard from anyone and I hope to never have to hear or think about this situation again. It’s behind me. I have no idea what happened with my ex and his wife, and I probably never will. 

Thank you guys for your support.",2019-07-05 22:14:38,284,3120,relationship_advice

I cant refuse to give her HER actual belongings that she leaves here, so I offer to bag it up, bring it to her house, leave it at the front step and leave, text her when I left so she can get it.

232,ca8u7t,space-request21,What’s wrong with me?,"Tl;dr I act like a jerk when my husband wants to hang out with friends rather than me and our kids. Is it jealousy? Am I crazy?

I don’t know why I (24F) am the way that I am. I am married to my husband (30M) for 3 years. Every time my husband wants to go out with friends or do something without me, I get really sad at first but then it turns to resentment.

For example, I asked if we could go to church today with our kids (9/1). He pulled me into the room and said “I know you’re going to be mad, but I forgot ____ invited me over today to hang out. We’ll go to church first, and I know that means leaving the girls here with you...”

Then I hit him with a rebuttal of “well, you’re going to be working for the rest of the week and you’re not gonna be seeing the kids that often”

I know I need to give him space and let him hang out with his friends, but now I’m just super irritated with him and I don’t know why.

I’m employed full time, but right now on some vacation time, so I feel like maybe he assumes I’m available to babysit? Idk.

I know I’ll probably get a bunch of backlash about how I’m probably suffocating him or smothering him, but I don’t think he would say that. I’m pretty lenient when he wants to go golfing or shopping or do car stuff. It’s just when he hangs out with friends, I’m like... why not hang out with family?

I have friends but I’d much rather hang out with my husband and kids.

Idk maybe I’m psycho.",2019-07-07 16:42:49,2,1,relationship_advice

236,ca8slq,away13355,the girl(21F) keep on apearing in my(21M) life and im unsure what to do next,"Long time lurker here. this is a throwaway as some people who know my Reddit frequent this sub. 

I'm not sure where to start so I will just start from the very start. Me and this girl ended up in the same class in high school. We live in a rather small town (5000 people). the school program I wanted to attend was not in our town so I attended high school in the neighboring town, the class was 50/50 between people from our town and the neighboring town. the girl was from the neighboring town so I had not known her at all until 1 day of school. 

&amp;#x200B;

throughout my academic years, I have been very lucky. both my parent are highly intelligent people that thought us the love of knowledge, and paired with an unusually good memorie that all the kids in the family have school was not hard, my father was also an athlete in his younger years. I had really good grades, not the best but I never did homework as I did not see the necessity for it. I was always the kid in class everyone would ask for help before test and group projects. this might seem like a little self jerk of but I say this as this is somewhat important in this story. 

&amp;#x200B;

So school starts and the first couple of weeks people get to know each other, I make new friends, etc the usual start of high school stuff. I'm quite easy to talk to and I get friendly with the entire class, we had a good group, not much bullying etc. the girl was also one of them, got to know her name and son general stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

as the weeks went by and the test started the usual helping people starts. in the beging, it was only people that I knew from before but as time went on more and more people started to catch on. I never had a problem with it as it was never more than 10-15min of help that I needed doing, it was also a way for me to get to know the people on a more personal note. I have many friends today from conversations that started form me helping in a way. 

&amp;#x200B;

The girl was one of them. she was a smart girl but math was really not her thing, she could write you deep analysis on a poem but algebra made her brain dead. she was not special at that time as there where several girls in my class that I would help during breaks and over skype after school. I got to know her more and more and we would sometimes chat, but we were not friends. the conversations were only about school most times and we never hung out after school. 

&amp;#x200B;

this continued the first year and to the end of the second year of high school. at the end of the second year I couth feelings for her. we where on a school trip and as we had talked a lot about math and cats over the 2 years we hit it off. I realized how cool of a chick she was. but it turned out she was in a relationship. I was crushed but as a normal teen I just hid my emotions and went on with life. 

&amp;#x200B;

high school ends and I move away to uni pursuing my degree. at this point I have 0 contacts with the girl and about 10 months go by. out of the blue get a long message from the girl thanking me for all the times I helped her and more, I still have the message to this day. I reply and we start talking a bit about how life's been. at this point, it is obvious that she is at a low point. I tell her I'm coming home the following weeks for a holiday and invite her to a cup of coffee. she accepts and we have good contact the following weeks until we meat up. I will not lie I enjoyed talking to her a lot during the coffee and I could feel some of the emotions coming back. during the coffee, we talk about life after high school and much more.

&amp;#x200B;

the meeting ended up lasting 6h or so, we talked about life, hobbies, she wanted to know about college life as she had taken a year off saving some money. she also started talking about the past relationship she broke off not long before messaging me. I respectfully told her that I don't have an interest in that and she understood. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went back to college and the conversations slowed down more and more. I won't lie I liked the girl a lot and I was really hurt in high school so I was a bit hesitant to open myself up. my life went on but the girl had made an imprint in my mind again.  

&amp;#x200B;

the following 2 years we had coffee 2-3. initiated every time by her. she would start messaging me 2 weeks before major holidays and see if I was coming home or not. at one meeting she was sobbing in front of me and asking for life advice. she has mad a couple of og mistakes and in her life and it looks like she comes to me when she is down low. 

&amp;#x200B;

now im 1 year away from getting my degree and i was looking for a summer job without much luck. the girl messaged me again we talked and I mentioned the summer job. within days her boss was called me offering me a job. I was told that the girl had given a recommendation so she invited me to an interview and I got the job. when I asked her why she did it she told me she wanted to spend more time with me and she wanted to see how I would do among her colleges. 

&amp;#x200B;

long story but here is my question. what does she want? I can admit that I have not made a real attempt as I don't want those feelings to come and hurt me again. I really like the company and I know she likes mine too. a couple of days ago she said in a joking way ""would it not be fun if the two of us just went somewhere and started a business together"" in a joking way I said that could be fun. her reaction was surprised but she seemed a bit serious. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have left out a lot of details in this post as I would need pages to write all we talked about. what does she want? should i take a shot? what should i do? I'm really confused as what to do next",2019-07-07 16:38:41,1,1,relationship_advice
237,ca8sbk,ItachiUchiha1997,"Am I in the friend zone?, it might sound cheesy but my heart really aches and I never felt I'd be so vulnerable in my life. Some advise really please, thanks in advance!","So, there is this co-worker of mine. It's been a year since we met. Initially while getting to know her, we sort of hit it off since we were connecting on different things and topics and I really felt something for her. Things go on, we keep going out with a group of friends, she was really a good person at heart. She used to subtly indicate at a lot of times that I was a really good friend to her. After a while I sort of couldn't take it anymore, I confessed my feelings for her and she was actually speechless at that moment, I let her know that I'll want to stay distant from her try to forget her. 


Later over a week or two, She tried to convince me twice or thrice to talk back to her. But I was stern that I wanted to forget her, as my feelings had intensified over a couple of months. 8 months later, she tries to convince me again and I sort of give in to her explanation. She wants to keep talking to me and so on but she mentions that she has crushes but never felt like pursuing a guy in her life, so she'll never be sure if she would like me in the same way. The main cause of my confusion is that, I always feel that she likes me whenever we interact, I've seen no girl sharing so many things or being so playful with me while just being friends, it's probable that I'm very naive. Moreover, this girl has another female friend, whom I used to hang out with a lot. We were just friends. But this girl has indicated at different times about the female friend having a boyfriend and how I should stay away, subtly always. 


After this whole episode that lasted over 8 months that I don't talk to her, avoid her, I know it's really selfish but that was for my own emotional stability, I fell head over heels in love just about in 2-3 months. We both went out recently and I really felt that she liked me, It was just the both of us but quite a beautiful day for me which I'll probably remember all my life. We will probably not be seeing each other after a few months, she has a traveling job and I'll probably leave mine to join the armed forces. She knows about this and keeps asking when we would meet again in life. I keep telling her that I'll always find time for her, just a cheesy thing I say. Please know that we live in India and I'm 22 and I have no relationship experience, probably as I was never talking to girls invested in reading and my guy friends always. 

Sorry for the long post! And thank you very much for reading this far.

Married man in work, cheats constantly. His wife has found out about it - he's for 2 kids from affairs. He's 38 - 40. Girl in work recently single is 24. Her and I had a thing when she was on a break from her boyfriend, before they split up, and married guy didn't like it - making my life hell in the office.

Since all this drama (there's a lot - harassment from her ex, married guy spreading lies and rumours around office, he's now attempting to get me and 2x managers fired, using his wife as a tool to contact HR - she said that married guy and girl are having an affair and made a complaint, he's taken things from my desk as he's been coming into office when he's not meant to be, and it's been confirmed by the building's security), those two have now become inseparable. She claims that they are just friends (most honest and trustworthy person she's ever met), and that's it, but they message constantly - a colleague mentioned she said she spent a full day texting him, none stop. A comment was made about how ""close"" they really are, and she denied anything and said they're just friends, but since that comment will not speak in the office, do everything via text, and then wait for each other outside after work. 

Since now HR are involved, due to the call from his wife, saying about a supposed affair between the two of them, she (24) has become exceptionally giddy in work and overly nice to everyone. Either she has no idea about the wife calling work, or its part of a big game.

241,ca8pnx,ftrlskoala,How do I hold back?,"tl;dr: I met someone I have strong feelings for but don’t want to go too fast and scare her and she is too busy for a relationship for another month. What are some good ways to combat these feelings for a while and keep from being clingy?

So the backstory:

So I (32m) met this woman (31f) about a year and a half ago in a really random way and we immediately hit it off. We will call her Taylor. It was right before her law school exams so she was pretty busy. We hung out a couple of times after that with long gaps in between and every time clicked so well. She was always clear that finishing her law degree was the most important thing to her and she didn’t have time for anything but that. I’ve since talked to a couple of her friends and they were always shocked at how much she avoided a social life during school.

Well fast forward to about 3 weeks ago and I’m out on a date with a woman who I didn’t really want to be seeing but was kinda lonely so I kept going out with her. She said something that immediately made me think of Taylor and I just couldn’t get it out of my head. So when my date goes to the bathroom I shot a quick text to Taylor and just said what’s up. So we start texting back and forth and I find out that she’s moving that week but also in the middle of studying for the Bar exam (American lawyer certification). So since I know school always comes first I see the opportunity to hang out during her move.

I took an extra day off from work and get to her place at 8am and the day turns out to be the best. We didn’t really do much since she had movers so we spent some good time together. It gets really late as we are talking and she asks me to spend the night. At this point it feels like a pity sleepover since the trains are done and she feels bad. So I figure I’ll be on the couch and tell her I would rather Uber home. She says I would be in bed with her so I stay.

Nothing happens until the middle of the night and we wake up and start getting physical. We don’t fully have sex but mess around for a while. I’m pretty stoked but not over the moon because I figure she’s just enjoying herself. That is until she starts to hold me after. The way she was holding on and pulling me in was so intense. I’ve been with a reasonable amount of people in my life in varying degrees of relationships but never has somebody held on so tight. I can’t really describe it. We spent the rest of the night and all morning dozing off and waking back up and she would pull me in tight again.

So we have had another night like this last week but it was much more date-like where we went out to dinner and had a long talk on the balcony. That night we immediately start fooling around when we get into bed and it’s the same thing, she is just holding me so close and I dunno, I can just feel the passion and love. The whole night and next day she doesn’t miss an opportunity to hold me or kiss me or get sexual with me. We couldn’t let go until almost dinner when I finally pried myself away to go home so she could study more.

So when I fall for people I fall hard. And I’ve fallen HARD for this woman. She has 4ish more weeks of studying for the Bar exam before she has any time to hang out. The only reason we spent the second night together was because it was my birthday and she said that was a good enough excuse to not study for the day.

Here is the issue I need help with: what techniques can I use to stop myself from calling/texting her all the damn time? I want to talk to her every second of the day and spend every night with her but I also don’t want to add to her stress. It sounds weird but I need some ways to avoid her for a few days here and there so I can give her space.

242,ca8oz2,throwaway27682,I (23F) am having serious trouble feeling sympathy towards my boyfriend (22M).,"Let me start off by saying that I'm not a sociopath, I do feel love and compassion and sympathy. My only problem is that lately, I have to force myself to respond to him as if I really do empathize with him. 

For context though, he complains a lot. If any little thing goes wrong he immediately texts me about it and it feels so wrong of me to feel this way but lately I just want to tell him to take care of himself and stop bothering me. I complain about things too, don't get me wrong but it feels almost excessive. However, I never feel this way towards my friends, so it really shocks me how heartless and cold I feel (sometimes) when he tells me about his problems.

We've been dating for almost 2 years now and I love his family, and they like me (the same with my family and him), so I don't want to ruin such a good relationship over something like this. I love him a lot most of the time... but then sometimes I just don't, without warning.

243,ca6fjv,Aland_Khalid,Should I stop trying to help my suicidal friend?,"English is not my first language so bear with me

TLDR: my friend is anorexic, and I recently found out also suicidal. I have tried to help her in every way I can think of, but it doesn’t feel like she values our friendship despite saying otherwise. Is she trying to hint that we should stop being friends? Should I stop trying to help her? Am I terrible for feeling this way?

Background: We were in the same class in high school but didn’t really talk much. I wasn’t exactly too social and rarely hung out with anyone outside off class. After graduation, I tried to change that and started to meet some old classmates. I (m22) asked her (f23) if she wanted to meet for coffee so that we could catch up as I hadn’t seen her since graduation. While talking casually she revealed that she had been depressed for quite some time, which explained her absence. But she also told me about her anorexia, and how it had affected her life. I could see that she was sick, and that she had become rather skinny and bony since graduation. I thanked her for sharing, knowing how hard it can be to open up, and promised that she could always be honest with me in the future. I also promised her that we would stay friends, and that she would always have someone to talk to. I knew that she was afraid of chasing away her friends, and knew that I had to reassure her that I would keep being her friend.

The two of us started to hang out, sparsely but more than before. Sometimes it would just be us simply going for a walk, sometimes it would be with other friends. Our walks became more frequent, and we would talk and update each other about everything that was happening in our lives. We would talk until she became fatigued and had to return home to rest. We mostly communicated through messages and knowing that she was tired I wouldn’t pester too much about meeting in person. But I, as well as a few of our mutual friends, still wanted to show her that we were friends by inviting her out to social events, or smaller gatherings of only close friends. Every other week I or our other mutual friends would ask if she wanted to hang out but she rarely could, either being away for treatment (which in fairness are a week long for each session) or simply being tired. Often when the two of us had decided to meet for a walk she would cancel in the last minute. She canceled so often that I stop preparing for our meetings/walks as I knew that she would cancel anyway. I still messaged her, but it started to bother me that it was always that I would message her first, not the other way around. And the fact that she flaked on us, and cancel walks minutes before we were supposed to meet started to annoy me. I started to think that she didn’t want to be friends at all, and by canceling on me/us it was her way of giving us a hint that the friendship was over.

She is still somewhat active on social media, and has at times shown signs of improvement. She moved out of her parents' house, enrolled in a course at the university, and we hung out a bit more often than before. My girlfriend and I were invited to tea at her new place, and she looked healthy. By pure coincidence, I met her and her mother at a comedy show. Her mom was thrilled to meet me, and I assumed that she had been told about me. The fact that her mom had heard of me, and was so nice to me, suggests that I wasn’t an annoyance to her daughter.

But soon things returned to their old way. She apparently stopped going to school, her health hasn’t improved much and the last time we met was over a year ago. I still message her sometimes, asking her if she wants to meet but she never can. A month ago she responded to a message that she was simply tired of everyone giving her advice, and being told that things will improve. She confessed that she was suicidal, and that she would have killed herself long ago if not for her mom and her sisters. She wrote to me that she knows exactly how she would do it, and that death doesn’t scare her. Deep down I know that she is serious, but I don’t know what else there is that I can do. I’m not her closest friend, and it feels like she is screaming for help while also distancing herself from me. I do still cherish our friendship but in almost four years of sparse messages and rare meetings, it doesn’t feel like she wants to meet me halfway. Like I can reach her my hand, but so far she hasn’t accepted my help. I should say that I am terrible at supporting people, but I try my hardest. My friendship with her has honestly left me exhausted, stressed and hopeless. I don’t know what to do, and no matter what I do it feels like the wrong thing. If I keep trying to help her she won’t respond and I will only exhaust myself, and If a stop trying then I am betraying a friend that could be in serious need of help.",2019-07-07 12:43:31,2,2,relationship_advice
244,ca8ofo,MyLifeIsEgg,My [21F] close friend-with-benefits [25M] had sex with me while I was blackout drunk and crying and I don't know what to do about it,"Content warning: sexual assault, child sexual abuse

For reference (names changed):
FWB - 25M - Strictly sexual benefits, otherwise a close friend for the past 5 years. 
Luke - 26M - FWB's roommate and old HS friend, one of my best friends for 9 years. 
Regina - 20F - My actual best friend for 10 years, close friends with Luke for 7 years

TL;DR: My friend witnessed my other drunk/hypoglycemic friend fuck me while I was also drunk and having a depressive breakdown. I don't remember almost any of it and I don't know how to talk to the offending friend about it, nor do I know what to do moving forward from it.

Background: I've been dicking around with FWB for the past year, it's been a bit messy due to me having feelings and having to temper them, but otherwise whenever I'm at FWB's apartment we have sex 1-3 times daily. Regina is visiting from her university for a week and we're all staying at FWB and Luke's apartment. Regina and I are bi and have sex, and we had a threesome with FWB a few days ago. 

This took place yesterday. I had been talking to FWB about having another threesome on/off. After a day out doing summer shit we all got together in the living room of their apartment and played a drinking game. For context, FWB is a 6ft gym bro, pretty muscley and fit. I'm a 130lb Asian girl, also a weightlifter, with my alcohol (in)tolerance infamous to the point of being memed on - like, 2 shots and I'm wobbly, and I drink maybe once every four months on average, and only socially (just lsd for me, thanks). Regina abstained from drinking much alcohol because she'd had a bad hangover a week prior (this is relevant/important because a lot of this is from her POV). We were taking shots of 40% alcohol and 20% alcohol.

Near the end of the games I'd taken about 5 shots of each percentage, far more than I should have, but I was in the apartment of my longtime friends and wasn't concerned. We recorded it on paper as it happened over the course of like 4 hours. FWB had 12 shots of the 40%, and he drinks even less often than I do. FWB and I flirted and play fought, generally having some sexual tension. Luke went to lie down because he was feeling nauseous, and I went to the bathroom, and FWB and Regina started fooling around together on the couch. Usually, for me, that would be hot, but my overly drunk ass got triggered when I walked back into the room and I sorta just laid down and began to cry. I've been in a bad headspace recently, as I suffer from depression, and caring more for someone than they do for you is just an all around oof.

So, it's about 12am and I'm ugly crying on the living room floor. From this point on my memory is really spotty, so the following is what Regina told me today.

Regina consoles me briefly, and Luke comes out and worriedly hovers and asks if I'm okay and if I need anything. I'm mortified because I hate people seeing me cry and the reason I was crying was so trivial. Regina dismisses Luke saying that she'll handle it, and goes into FWB's room to get tissues. FWB follows her and they make out a bit, and he propositions her for sex, telling her to get on the bed. She says she wants to go help me, but he grabs her hand and tries to pull her into bed with him. She says no, because she was worried about me, and pulls herself away from him and goes to use the restroom/get toilet paper (no tissues). At this point I do remember bits of what happened.

I'm still crying motionless on the floor. Suddenly I feel FWB in my presence and he asks ""What's up"". I don't remember what I said, but he starts kissing me and then French kissing me while I'm still crying. I figured, in my addled brain, that he was trying to distract me from crying because he's not good at emotional shit. In my meltdown I remember saying ""If I disappeared you wouldn't even notice or care"" and I do remember him saying ""I would because I wouldn't have a hot pussy to fuck"" or something along those lines, which probably didn't help my mood. I didn't feel pressured or anything, I just went along with it. Despite everything, I trust FWB to not hurt me, and I know he wouldn't continue if he knew I was against it. I didn't feel threatened or intimidated at all. I just have a fucked up mental where I constantly want to please others at my own expense. This is not the first time I've gone along with sex I wasn't entirely into to please a boy, but usually I'm sober and I get into it over time. 

From here, again, I don't remember much but bits and pieces, but Regina reentered the room to see us together and sorta sat by to watch (again, threesome was in the cards). FWB starts trying to declothe me and asks me to move to assist and I apparently responded with ""I can't."" After declothing me, FWB initiated a 69 with me, and Regina witnessed me ""spit out his dick repeatedly"" (I have absolutely no memory of ever having a dick in my mouth). She said she felt paralyzed and didn't know if she should do anything or if she was just overreacting. Eventually FWB just positions himself missionary on top of me and penetrates me and starts going at it. According to Regina I didn't even react to it, I just continued to cry and said something along the lines of ""Why are you doing this, you don't even like me."" At this point, Regina realizes shit's actually fucked, and says ""Dude, she's not into this,"" to which FWB replies ""Okay, you get over here then.""

By now Regina has gotten her bearings and starts yelling at him saying ""Am I supposed to be turned on watching you fuck my drunk crying friend? I'm not interested in fucking you, you're basically just raping her."" And I, being my fucked up self, keep crying and say ""It's fine, this is all I'm good for anyway,"" and ""I deserve this"" and ""It's not rape, I've been raped before, I'm not four anymore I'm an adult it's fine"" (referencing prior abuse that only Regina knew about, that in hindsight went down a lot like this scenario in terms of me not resisting but not being into it, but also not feeling threatened or anything). FWB is clearly shook and fucking pulls away and sits with his head in his hands. Regina of course realizes shit is not fine and comforts me and tells me I'm worth more than that while putting my clothes back on me because I'm too drunk to do it myself. I apparently just kept repeating ""I'm fine""/""It's fine"". FWB then gets violently ill, so I check his blood sugar meter (Type 1 Diabetic) and have a panic attack because he's at 30something mg/dl and I don't know if he'll be able to metabolize sugar properly with that much alcohol in his system. I proceeded to try to feed him a poptart. From here shit is unrelated, Luke swooped in after hearing my panic and helped handle FWB.

I honestly didn't remember he had sex with me at all, the last thing I remember clearly is making out with him, then my memory skips to the point where he had low blood sugar. I didn't know anything else happened until Regina told me this morning, upset and blaming herself for not intervening sooner. It brought back some memories but none of them are very detailed and I definitely don't recall the sensation of being fucked. I know it sounds stupid, and Regina has been denying it all day, but I know FWB is not actually that type of person. I've known him long enough to know he wouldn't continue if he thought I didn't want it, I just think he was out of it from both the alcohol and the blood sugar situation and wasn't paying attention. I didn't say no or resist at all, and went along with it myself. 

It's all fucked because he was just as shitfaced and intoxicated as I was, if not more due to the hypoglycemia, and his memory is spotty as well. I felt responsible at the time because I pressured him to drink more and I drank way too much myself. This morning he was clearly upset and everything and apologized, and he said he wanted to talk about it, but when he sat next to me to talk he asked me to confirm I didn't have feelings for him and we discussed that shit instead. We still haven't talked about the whole ordeal outside of that. I plan on doing so face to face tomorrow afternoon when he gets home from work. The thing is, I don't know how I feel at all. I don't know what to say or how to talk about it. I don't know how to confront him or handle it at all. I'm completely lost and I hesitate to call the situation a rape because I don't want to cheapen the term or overstate what happened. I forgive him despite not excusing his behavior or actions, and I don't think he's really a bad person. I think we both just had way too much to drink and that I can't attribute to malice what could easily and, in his case, frequently be attributed to stupidity. He also didn't/doesn't know that I'd been sexually abused as a child and probably didn't understand why I would sort of shut down and allow it if I wasn't into it.

I don't feel traumatized or anything, I honestly think Regina is moreso than I am. I'm mostly just reeling, still. I'm not physically injured at all, either. I don't know how I'm supposed to feel or how to talk about it with FWB. We're usually decent at communicating but I don't even know what I should say if anything. I can't tell anyone outside of this apartment about what happened because I don't want to hurt FWB's reputation, so I have no idea if I'm being reasonable or not in any regard. I don't want to lose him as a friend, but Regina hates his guts now and wants nothing to do with him. How do I approach this situation? What steps should I take moving forward?",2019-07-07 16:28:21,3,1,relationship_advice

However we’ve lived together for nearly a year and he has put no effort into my birthday to the stage where he won’t even be around for it. 
I told him I’m upset because I do so much for him and he doesn’t even want to try to make me happy. 
He said that birthdays are for 12 year olds not 25 year olds and to get over myself.
He always tries to be hurtful when he is in the wrong.
He is acting like this because he completely takes me for granted and feels like no matter what I’d never leave.
The thing is though there is only so far I can be pushed before I won’t care about him anymore and I don’t want that.
When it comes to that stage everything will be too late.
He can be so selfish and hurtful and I can’t shake off his comments and selfishness over the past few days.
He always puts everyone else before me which I normally don’t mind but when it comes to the one day a year that he is supposed to put me first he attacks me with nasty comments instead.
I don’t want this relationship to turn me into a bitch.

246,ca8mfm,robertmar12,Mom (F58) forcing me (M21) to text in group text about God,"So I've been in a very depressed state and my mom is probably trying to help me by saying I should give God more of a chance by praising him more. I dont live with my mom and instead live with my dad 5 hours away (divorced as kid). Dont talk to my mom much except on the phone every 2 weeks since that was what was a greed upon but I miss one call here and there. Phone calls with her tire me out especially since I'm not a big talker. I know my mom has good intentions in telling me to text in a group chat about praising God but honestly I dislike it. My mother is a very headstrong and stubborn person on everything especially when she wants you to do something. I always attempt to tell her how I feel about things whether it's a discussion or an argument but she always ends up putting a spin on things and bringing up past stuff and somehow making a connection to her main point for whatever she wants. It doesnt even feel worth telling her how I feel about this or trying to get out of it because somehow I know shell still get her way in the end and it's very frustrating for me. I believe in God but it's not like I wanna be talking about him everyday in a group text message praising him or whatever else she sends lesson wise. I dont answer in the chat but I do read whatever is said just so she cant hold that against me. But I'm honestly pissed about this situation. She sent me a message on Thursday that reads, ""Hey baby, I want u to participate in our group text. Find something positive to contribute and send to us. U need to know u are blessed and showing some gratitude is a start. Btw, I'm not asking. I love u more than u know. 😘"" so I just sucked it up and sent a quick message praising God. Then I wake up today to see she has sent me another message that reads, ""Good morning, this is not a one-time ask. LUM😘."" I'm so frustrated by this situation and would like to resolve this before I go up in a couple weeks to spend time with her since she lives in a different city. Is there anything I can do to get her off my back about this group message and showing her that forcing me to do this doesn't help me at all but is having the opposite effect?",2019-07-07 16:23:05,14,0,relationship_advice
247,ca8mdw,Sentient_sambar,"I (18M) have been with this girl (18F) for almost 2 months now, and I know she likes me but she just doesn't show it. (I would really appreciate some help because I have no one else to talk to)","Using a throwaway account, and this is the first time I'm posting something like this on Reddit, so please let me know if I should provide additional information.

Before I get on with the story, I must mention that I live in quite a conservative country (India), and while my family and I are not very conservative at all, most other people who live here are. This girl is also semi-conservative. So please keep that in mind while reading.

So I met this girl in college who joined my class a few months ago. We immediately began talking and hit it off quite well. After a week or so, I heard from a mutual friend that she likes me, and to be honest, I kinda liked her too. So we spoke about it and we got together. But it didn't just happen like that. 

I got out of a pretty serious 2 year relationship about 5 months prior, so I wasn't looking for anything long term. In my mind, we would get together and see how it goes, without pre planning anything. We spoke about this and completely agreed and everything was fine. We spoke a lot, hung out and all was well.

But here's the problem. She has certain moments where she shows interest and when she actually acts like she likes me and we're a couple. But most of the time, it's uninteresting and awkward. I spoke to her about it and she said she needed time to adjust to new people. I'm totally fine with that. 

But now it's been almost 2 months and she's the same. Occasionally when we meet up, she'll lean on my shoulder and hold my hand and all that is great. But other times it's just the opposite. I don't even feel like I have a girlfriend. 

I really don't know what to do and would really appreciate some advice.

250,ca8lb1,EcstaticSympathy,"I [21M] have never been/seen someone in such a situation with their best friend/crush [21F] before, what should I do?","Tl;dr at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, sorry for the long post, I'm trying to cram everything relevant to the situation in a few paragraphs. The tl;dr at the bottom should give a vague idea about the issue.

I have been friends with a girl (I'll be referring to her as A) for the past 18 months (I have arguably been her guy best friend for the last year or so), and I fell in love with her. I got the wrong signals from her and thought she reciprocated the feelings, so I told her I love her. She had broken up with her ex 6 months prior and was still healing, since they were together for about 3-4 years, so she let me know she's currently not looking for a relationship, and she made me promise that nothing should change between us. I've honestly never been in a relationship and I don't usually seek out one so I was totally fine with how it unfolded.

What I'm here to ask advice for is how things have become since then. It turns out that A likes it when I flirt with her, or when I compliment her outfit, or when I tell her I love her, and she made that clear a week after the confession (I thought she would be uncomfortable and I was pretending that the confession never happened, but it looks like my love was empowering to her in some way). When flirting/complimenting happens over text, she'd reply with hugs, hearts and kisses. That struck me as weird from the very beginning, since in regular circumstances, you would expect friendships like these to eventually die out, since the guy would be trying to get over the girl. She would actually be encouraging of me letting her know that I am madly in love with her, and I would obviously oblige, since I know that this makes her happy, and I want her to be happy. Things have been like that for about 8 months now, and all of our fallouts since then (I count 4-5 off the top of my head) would be because she feels that I don't love her or care for her, she would explicitly say ""that's not how you behave when you love someone"" when I behave inadequately or if I'm not supportive enough.

When I first confessed, we talked things out in a very civilized fashion, and she explicitly said ""who knows what might happen down the road"". I'm not hanging on to that, since in my mind it looked like a nervous response more than anything, and it's very unlikely that we end up together, I just thought that it was something curious of her to say. So I brought the matter up twice since then, and I told her that it's not fair for me to still be in love with her just because of the hope she gave me (even though my love has been declining since then for obvious reasons), so she'd reiterate what she said the first time around.

I really don't mind staying like that, as we're basically like a couple, minus her complimenting me back and us being physical with each other, I just wanted to see what the people of reddit can make out of her behavior (i.e. whether she's being manipulative or not, whether she likes me back but she's hesitant for us to be together etc...). We're also parting ways for our studies, so that'll add a strain to our relationship as well, since I will be meeting new people and things might get weird if I don't have things planned. Any input is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: She treats relationships like marriages, i.e. she only gets with someone if she can see herself marrying them (and that would obviously take a long time to figure out). I'm not like that, and I'm honestly not looking that far forward when I ask to be together with someone. Not sure if that is relevant, just thought I would point that out.

Tl;dr: Told my best friend I love her. She actually likes that I do and does not want me to ever stop loving her, even though we're not together. What should I make of her behavior?",2019-07-07 16:20:18,2,1,relationship_advice
251,ca8kyh,ImHereToGetALife,When you still have exes in your life,"Ok guys I (26m) have an issue in my current relationship of 8 months with my girlfriend (21). So since the beginning of our relationship, her most recent ex has constantly tried to contact her. Whether it be through Snapchat, Instagram, phone calls, whatever. Once in person but she dodged that encounter. So I don’t have an issue with exes being around I guess, cause you can be friends if you’d like, they’re still people. My only thing is to do that once everyone has moved on with life and grown a little bit. I still have mine on social media and such but we don’t communicate. Her ex calls or messages her at least once a month. She doesn’t answer or anything which is nice but it’s annoying to see his name pop up. He obviously has no respect for our relationship and it’s annoying to see his name pop up. She says she blocks him and then a month or two later she unblocks him and the calls resume. Am I wrong for asking her to block him 100% and leave it? Do I need to just get over it because she’s not truly entertaining his reaching out? For me it’s because a guy will take any opportunity and I feel like sitting there and hoping “this will be the time she answers” just kind of encourages the behavior.

Just need to get this off my chest.

My ex and I had a decent relationship overall, we had bumps in the road as all couples do, she struggled with depression tried to get better but it lead to me feeling like a therapist more than a boyfriend.

After around 6 years I found myself dodging hanging out with her, felt it was a chore to listen to her and just felt unhappy. I ended it, was extremely hard to do, to let go of my best friend, to go from doing everything with someone to not having them.

But i met someone else nearly right away around 2 months after. This new person is like a breath of fresh air, we are so compatible its ridiculous.

The previous relationship

To make it short, we were dating for 7 months, we had a great time but it didn’t work out. Too many different interests, 6 year age gap (I’m 26 and she’s 20), and it just didn’t feel like the right thing. We broke up about a month ago. 

The ‘old new girl’

I worked a job at my university and about a year ago I met this girl who happened to be my co-worker. We had some night shifts together, and we connected instantly on a very deep level. I always have the best talks with her and we were always pretty good friends. We shared deep thoughts and secrets with each other, all while I was still dating the other girl. Nothing ever happened because I never thought about this too much. Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, and her and I started hanging out more. We have a lot of things in common, and whenever she comes over to my house to party with me and my friends, it’s always us two alone who end up having deep conversations until 6am. 

One night I had a few drinks and I told her how I felt about her and her response was very confusing. She said that our friendship is the most important thing to her, but she thanked me for telling (for some reason she seemed happy that I told her, even though her response can be interpreted as a deep friend zone). Even after that, we hung out quite a lot and we still had our late night talks. One time we even kissed for a brief moment but we might have had a few drinks too many. 

A couple of nights ago she spent the night at my place, we were in bed together but nothing happened except of spooning and playing with each others hands. She is always up to do something with me, and she has also been inviting me to do things with her (kayaking, bowling, taking a trip to Nashville to see her best friend, etc.). How do I know if she’s into me? I’ve been stuck in friend-zones too many times and I’d hate to lose this girl because I know we would be great for each other. When we’re together I really want to make a move but I’m scared of being rejected. The other night she let me massage her and it seemed like she was totally fine with me touching her almost anywhere. I’m just confused, so if anyone has any advice please let me know. Thank you so much, and stay amazing!!",2019-07-07 16:16:24,1,0,relationship_advice

For a long time I loved and respected my twin sister. She's been one of my best friends and we've always had a good relationship even though we've slightly drifted apart recently after I got married and moved etc. All of that changed a few days ago.

Recently, my 3 sisters (28,24 and 18) and I (28) got together at my house to catch up and drink. Everything was fine, until my twin sis got quite drunk and told us that she likes having sex with married men. It's like her fetish or something. She told us she has slept with a former boss, neighbours, colleagues etc all of whom are married. I was absolutely disgusted when she told us this. Everything I thought I knew about her disappeared in that moment. She told us she likes to challenge herself to see if she's ""sexy and charming"" enough to seduce married men especially religious ones. She also said she likes having sex with married men who are trying to fix their marriage. This was when I lost all respect for her and almost swore at her and called her names. I couldn't believe how sick and twisted her mind is. I no longer wanted to be anywhere near her.

About a minute later, she calmed down a bit and in a softer tone told us that she is currently in a five year long affair with the husband of her close friend who she's known since childhood (let's call her Jane). I was never really close with Jane but she's a very nice person. She's quite religious and works with religious charities and is an all-round good human being. She's married to a guy (John) she's known for 2 decades and they have 3 children together. I couldn't believe my sis would betray her close friend like this. I really think Jane deserves to know about this.

But there is one problem: sex for me isn’t nearly as good as I want it to be. She enjoys it way more than I do. I feel bad for not being satisfied, but with a condom on I just can’t feel much down there. I still like doing it, because it’s intimate and I enjoy making love to her, but my penis not feeling much kind of ruins the experience. Feels like kissing if a plastic bag was covering my mouth. I can’t enjoy her body nearly as much as I want to. Also, I enjoy sex the most when I feel that she is wet and it's heaven when she is creamy... But with a condom feeling that is basically impossible.

Sometimes when we are unusually horny I really enjoy it (10-20% of the time), but mostly it just isn’t that good. For a whole week before we meet I am constantly thinking about sex, but I usually just get disappointed because it turns out to be not that good. I would do it at least twice a day because she is incredibly attractive and I have high libido, but I know it wouldn’t be as good as I want it to be. So either we do it only once, or we do oral instead. Also, her vagina often starts to hurt when we do it twice a day, but it’s not latex allergy. We went to a gynecologist for this who basically said nothing.

I tried enjoying it, I truly did. I also tried convincing myself I was enjoying it, but that was not a good idea.

I know for a fact that my dissatisfaction has nothing to do with the sex itself, as we have done it in other ways and it was unbelievable.

A year ago we decided to give the pill a try. Although she is okay with condoms, she wanted it bad as well (but probably not as bad as me). For the first 1-2 months it was amazing for the both of us. It felt like... freedom. But after a while her libido decreased, she wasn’t enjoying it as much as before and she wasn’t nearly as wet. Also, she rarely had a g-spot orgasm from my penis (without the pill she does 90% of the time) so every time we did it I had to try my best. I felt terrible and ashamed that I wasn’t able to satisfy her and had to finish her with my fingers almost every single time. So we stopped.

We tried two different types of spermicide suppositories (the one you have to insert 10 min before sex) combined with the pullout method. It’s not the safest so we only did this once or twice a week. With the first one sex was great, but after using it a couple of times her vagina started itching from the inside after our intercourses. The leaflet on the box said it’s a common side effect and we should stop, so we did. We also tried out a different one, but we stopped after the first try because she felt a burning sensation.

We tried anal a couple of times and I really enjoyed it, but even after an hour of warmup and taking it really slow she felt pain. She kind of enjoyed it, but couldn’t loosen up and was scared the entire time of pooping herself. I ensured her that if an accident happened I would not think less of her or anything, I honestly wouldn’t care. Also, it was an hour of a struggle for her to get it cleaned. So the bum is not really an option.

I enjoy receiving oral less than sex, and it is never as intimate, so doing that instead would not be very good.

We have done the pull out method a couple of times when our hormones wouldn’t take no for an answer. These were by far the best and craziest experiences for both of us, but I don’t think I have to explain why we should probably never do it again.

We also have tried several different condom brands, sensitive, ultra sensitive, regular, big, small, thin, put lube on the inside, outside... The ultra sensitive is the best, but barely better than a regular one.

So I guess if I don’t want condoms the only reliable option would be an arm implant or an IUD. Both of them are 99% effective, last for years, don’t require a condom or pull out. But I asked her opinion about half a year ago, and she said she would be really scared of an object being put inside of her, so I never mentioned it again. She is the kind of person who would worry all day, like what if it moves or gets lost inside of her (even when she knows there is almost no chance for that). And I didn’t even mention the side effects. During the winter, summer and other breaks we are always together, but besides that we don’t see each other 70% of the time. So she would have to bear the risks even if I’m not even there.

If I asked what if she did an implant/IUD, it would feel like I am forcing her to do it, because there isn’t really another option. She really cares about me so she would think that in order for me to enjoy sex she must do it... I feel really shitty that she is the one who has to bear all the discomfort and risks of the side effects. Plus she is okay with condoms.

The worst thing of all is that I hadn’t told her until now.

She knew I enjoyed it more without a condom, but it was only two weeks ago when I told her it was this bad. I should have done that a long time ago, it was stupid not to, but I just didn’t want to hurt her, or change her mind about past sex experiences. After I told her, during sex she worried about me not enjoying and therefore she enjoyed it less, which resulted in me enjoying it less… Communication has never been an issue, but I was just reluctant to tell her. I never faked anything, but I hid my feelings when I got disappointed. I sometimes just changed position so she wouldn’t know. A few times after sex she asked if I had enjoyed it and I said yes. It wasn’t a complete lie, because I did, kind of, but not nearly as much as she thought. I am fucking stupid.

Tell me your honest opinion on what I/we should do. Would you ask her to do an IUD/arm implant? Did you notice anything I did wrong? Have I just drunk from the holy grail and I should accept that it’s never going to be as good?

Am I just whining about it? Do many people experience this? By no means do I want to break up with her because I love her more than anything, and besides this the relationship is great. The update might not be soon since I’m not going to see her for another 2 weeks.",2019-07-07 15:58:47,22,0,relationship_advice
262,ca66qz,reddit_user_49,A guy(20) is cheating on his girlfriend(20) with my friend(20F) and she doesn’t think what she’s doing is wrong.,"According to her and another friend of mine the girlfriend is a bitch who’s just using the guy for money and homework help and is unavailable sexually and has been for years. So of course the guy would look somewhere else. And they seem to think that just because the girl is probably taking advantage of him and possibly cheating on the guy herself what they’re doing is reasonable. My friend and the guy don’t want anything serious and she doesn’t even want to be his girlfriend. Also according to the other friend (who agrees they’re not doing something reprehensible) the guy obviously wouldn’t want to break up with his hot girlfriend when my friend isn’t an option as a girlfriend.

Also my friend exchanged nudes with the guy and they think this guy who’s cheating on his girlfriend wouldn’t show them to others! That he’s not that kind of guy. 

I tried to tell them that she probably shouldn’t get involved with this kind of guy and that cheating isn’t right. But they just said that I don’t understand. Am I being too righteous and unsympathetic?

I feel like my friends have changed after we moved to different college and I don’t know how to deal with this. I feel like I should probably distance myself from them.

TL;DR: My friend thinks cheating is ok if the girlfriend is a bitch and I’d like opinions on how to deal with the situation.",2019-07-07 12:12:53,4,2,relationship_advice
263,ca8bf2,throwaway0I8,"My dad has put my brother and I into dangerous and abusive situations and has been neglectful, yet he acts like dad of the year and it makes me feel guilty","This will be long, so a TL;DR will be at the bottom.

[CONTEXT]
My parents are divorced and my dad and I never had a relationship. When my parents were married, he was rarely around because of work or affairs, and he would often schedule fishing tournaments, etc.

He never sees when he is wrong and insists he’s dad of the year, often acting entitled. He has stolen my Christmas money, has left me home alone with my much younger brother (he is 8 now but was younger when it began) without contact until 4am, has made emotionally abusive comments, and becomes irritated when I do not do what he wants (for example, he wanted me to come to his friends get together but it would have been all adults drinking and I was 15 at the time). I often act as the parent towards my younger brother and get ridiculed when my brother protests. For example, I took away his iPad after I told him to clean up his toys over and over again (there are many more similar instances) and I would get screamed at for being bossy. I was also left in charge. He also will abandon my brother in a hot tub for way too long that it is unsafe. He also blows up explosive on the lawn and insists we’re outside to watch, and he gets so mad when I make my brother and I watch from inside (one blew up an nearly killed someone once). There are more notable and extreme instances.

[EXAMPLES OF ISSUE]
1) It was his weekend (partial custody) and my mom had plans to go on a weekend trip with her boyfriend. Last minute, my dad said he wanted to go to a party (with his new girlfriend) and spend the night, so he couldn’t watch us. My mom made him take us because she had made plans and we are his responsibility. He often bails on his weekend but my mom almost always takes us without much protest. My mom put her foot down and we went with my dad. Then, my dad drove us on the side of the road near my moms house later in the day, and ditched my brother and I with our stuff. I called my mom and she left her trip and got us. He didn’t respond to any phone call for days.

2. (At 16) I was depressed and in bed until 11, and would not get up. He grabbed my legs and yanked me off the bed and I hit my head and spine (I have scoliosis and it sticks out in the back extra) on the wood flooring so hard I could barely move. 

3. He had a date (it was his weekend) and instead of telling us, he left my brother and I at Walmart to get groceries while he got a hair cut. We sat around for 4 hours. He did not get a hair cut, but he went on a date. 

4. And this was yesterday, and it was the last straw (sorry this is long)
I’ve had my learners permit for over a year and am about to take my drivers test. My dad jeopardized my license and my safety by inviting me and my brothers to lunch with some family. I asked him what else we would be doing in town, and he shrugged. He asked if I would want to drive on the way back and I happily said yes, as long as I was only driving him and his cousin which he told me I would be driving for only the two of them.  I was sitting in the back of the car on the way there and my cousin and his wife also got in, along with my dad and his cousin. He also did not invite my brothers like he said, and he told me we would be going to a playground so I could watch the littles play. Looking back, I believe he only told me this so I would come. If I knew the real reason he brought me, I would have stayed at the house. I realized that I would not want to drive on the way back because I was not comfortable driving 4 adults. We arrived in town and we all walked into a restaurant there and I thought we were going to eat. By now I figured we wouldn’t be doing the playground because the boys were not invited. The restaurant was busy and when we walked in, my dad led his group of 10 right to the bar and ordered a round of drinks. I was confused and stood awkwardly for quite some time. They ordered another round, and my dad started talking about other bars in town they would be going to. I was starving but he only offered water. It was too busy for food. Every adult was drinking and the drinks were about 12oz each. After standing awkwardly in a crowded bar, I said I wanted to call my older brother where it was quiet and ask about kittens that were on sale down the street. When I got in the car, I ended up calling my mom, who was over 2 hours away as my dad does not live nearby. My dad made multiple jokes that I was the “designated driver” but we both knew it was not a joke. I couldn’t get my brother to pick me up because his car was blocked in by the adult’s cars- the majority of the adults were with me. I knew if I protested driving I would get yelled at and forced into it until I cried by my dad, as he’s acted that way before, and after waiting in a hot car (I had the keys and the air was running but it was still very hot ) for over an hour and a half, they finally got back. They were all over at least 3 12oz drinks (I only witnessed 2 and they claimed to be going to at least one other bar) and were very talkative, giggly, and my dad was acting very braggy. Thankfully only one was intoxicated (she was drunk before we left the house) and the other three were just influenced. I decided it would be safer that I drive 35 minutes home, rather than my dad who was clearly not in the best place to drive. (He was not noticeably drunk, but his behavior was off and I know alcohol can reduce judgment and make things seem less risky.) thankfully the car ride was not too bad and I was able to drown the noise. They were very talkative and giggly. The only super distracting part is one insisted we drive with all the windows down which is very difficult for me because I am not a good driver (and I’m very new because I haven’t had as much practice despite driving with a permit for a year). It’s illegal for a permit driver to drive without a sober and attentive supervising adult and I could have lost my chance at a license and my father could have been charged as well for making me drive with them. I was also afraid of a DUI if my dad was driving. We are home safe but I cannot believe he lied to me to get me to drive his drinking party. It jeopardized my safety and the safety of the passengers in the vehicle. 

Thank you for reading this far.

TL;DR: My dad has been abusive and irresponsible multiple times and it has been dangerous and hurtful. He makes me feel guilty and acts like he’s the father of the year, especially on social media. 

How do I approach him as I am afraid of him simply denying it and making things worse?",2019-07-07 15:55:34,3,1,relationship_advice
264,ca8au5,throwawayasshole1233,Advice on dating a co worker,"Using a throwaway &amp; on mobile. I'll try keep it short and simple. I know they say you shouldn't date co workers but hear me out.

It's also worth noting I'm a bit of a stevie wonder when it comes to taking hints...

Recently joined a new company. I'm based in the HQ and co worker in question is based in another office 200 miles away. She often visits our office once a fortnight atleast.

So it starts off innocently flirting through emails and then moves over onto texts. I asked to take her out for a drink when she was next up (I specifically made it obvious I was asking her out) to which she said yes.

She came up last week and stayed in a nearby hotel. A couple hours after work went to the hotel and we had a few drinks at the bar. Everything was going fine, I seemed to be getting non verbal messages (constant hair playing, lots of eye contact, subtle touching of my forearm).

I was unable to drive and mentioned this to her and I think she thought I orchestrated a means of getting her in bed which she jokingly said. In an attempt to prove that my intentions weren't that I spent almost £200 on a separate room for the night. We had breakfast the next morning and went into work. I told her flirtatiously that a part of me wanted to make a move on her the night before but I held out because i didnt want to come off like I was only trying to get one thing. I asked if we were going to get another drink when shes back up and she said yes.

Thing is. I dont know her well enough to know if this niceness is just her personality or is she genuinely interested. We spent a full day texting each other during working hours (I dont fob work off but we both literally had nothing on that day). 

I'm getting hot and sime cold vibes off her which is why I'm posting this of some opinions on the matter. Not really sure how to play this one...

This post is not because I do not love her or because I want out, I just need to share my feelings and get some insight.

We have been together for awhile now. We live together, and even have a Small dog ( he is the best).
We started dating in high school and now go to the same college.

When we first started dating she was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, and I’ve been with her every step of the way. I go to doctors appointments with her and help with general pain all the time. 

This summer has been rough for me because I am struggling to figure out what I was to Major in, and also both of us have been working a lot. Her especially, she works at a hospital so she has very long shifts. She is also working more to save for a car ( upwards of 52 hours a week).

Since we have been spending less time together is makes things rough. Also since she has been working so much, she is in much more pain than she usually is in, so I’ve been taking care of her more when she comes home. Getting food, running to the store, getting stuff she needs, I’m doing it all mostly since she is in so much pain after work. 

Right now I feel more like a care giver than a boyfriend, ( or husband because we have talked already about our future together). I don’t feel the same spark as when we were first together.

For the first time in a minute though I felt something. 
It was at a party a few days back, and it wasn’t her. 
(I didn’t cheat, only talking but I felt something) 

I can’t get the interaction from that night out of my head. It’s driving me insane. 

I have no idea how to bring any of my feeling up to her or to even explain them.

266,ca8am1,whatttttodo,My ex and I broke up after 2yrs because I cheated. Now she’s talking to someone overseas and he’s planning to visit.,"I broke up with my ex in December. She started a one year program out of state in January and graduates in December. She said she wanted to focus on school and didn’t have time for a relationship so we started the year off 100% single. We still communicated pretty regularly from Jan-Mar. In the Mar/Apr timeframe, a family friend introduced her to some guy overseas. Our communication then decreased as theirs increased.

Still in communication, we went on a vacation weekend in May and I surprised her for her bday in Jun. On that trip we had sex for the first time in a while and she said she loved me. On the Jun trip, she asked to see my phone  (and to show I’m trying to rebuild trust) I said yea and she questioned me about some texts and pics. I asked to see hers and she said no - which was a red flag. What threw me for a loop is finding out her and the overseas guy got each other small gifts for their bdays (May/Jun - respectively).

Post both trips, I threw around the idea of us getting back together. She said no. She’s not getting into a relationship this year and didn’t want me to pressure her. 

Fast forward to this past weekend, I pick her up from the airport for the holiday week/weekend, she’s in town for 9 days and we spend time together on 5-6 of those days. Being human 🤦🏼‍♂️ I confronted her about the overseas guy and she says it’s none of my business cause we’re not exclusive and if she was in a serious relationship w/ another guy, she wouldn’t be spending time, sleeping over, kissing, etc me. I get it and that’s fair, because since were single, I’ve been dating other women and she’s causally talking to other guys.
 
The issue is that, in Nov/Dec, my ex and the overseas guy are planning to meet

I have no doubt in my mind, if I hadn’t cheated we’d still be together. We still communicate a couple times a week and see each other, when we’re both in the same state, but she only wants to revisit us in a committed relationship in Jan 2020.

I’m definitely not putting my life on hold. My dating life is good, but I do want her back.

Is this situation worth salvaging when she moves back home in January?
Could she be doing this to ‘get even’?
Am I just crazy and wasting my time?

Yes I cheated, she had some indiscretions, as well - no one is perfect. I can’t summarize 2yrs in a few paragraphs. Just want advice on determining next steps.

267,ca8afz,imaginaryfriendsteve,To what extent do you tell significant others your friends secrets?,"The way my friends and I operate, when we tell each other secrets or things we don't necessarily want other people to know, it's almost implied that significant others are an exception. They're an extension of us, and we just assume anything we say to a friend is allowed to be extended to the other half of the couple (unless otherwise directly stated).

I've realized that my boyfriend is a lot more loyal to his friends or at least he has a different understanding between his friends. He won't tell me every detail of something that has occurred if he feels that it would break the trust he has with them. And I generally respect this about him.

But then I worry I’ll regret walking away from the respectful and trusting relationship I have now, and what kind of ripple effects it will have on my very young kids. 

Have people legitimately found amazing sexual chemistry with someone they really love and respect and want to spend all their days with? Or is that just a fairy tale and it’s not possible to find someone who’s a wonderful and respectful partner, who blows your mind in bed, and you both love the idea of growing old together?

I’ve polled a lot of people I respect, and the vast majority of them have told me that what I’m craving is an illusion and doesn’t really exist. That the passion fades eventually and if I chase it I’ll be left with nothing to show for it but a broken family.

274,ca87h0,doggowiggle,Found husband using local hookup app,"TLDR: found out husband paid for hookup app when I was out on business trip last year.  



Background: Married for 1.5 years.  Everything has been going well. Husband in his early thirties. I’m in my mid twenties.  

Today we were taking about annual budgeting and I was trying to find out when some of our subscription services are due. They’re tied to his  apple account.  So he handed me his phone and let me check his Apple ID subscription history. 

Husband isn’t that tech savvy. I’m a software dev so he usually leave anything tech related to me. 

Subscription history shows that he paid for a hook up app late last year.  We weren’t married for a year yet.  I was away from home for work trip the day he made the purchase. 

I didn’t know what to think at first.  Said hey here’s your hookup app history. He grabbed his phone away and mentioned he used this app 10+ years ago.  We went out for brunch as usual.  (Later I learned that he immediately deleted that apple account,  “out of embarrassment “ he said) 

The more I thought about it the more uncomfortable I became.  Went home and confronted him. He blamed it on us fighting too much back then, and he just wanted to see what’s available on the market.   

He swore he never physically cheated, but wanted to find someone to sext with. 

When we were dating he was caught sexting with someone once when we were long distance. I always knew but he never admitted until today.  He the apologized and said he’s into sexting and fell back into it.  

I’ve always been open with our sex lives. We have conversations about sex, about what we’re into. He never brought up sexting.  He always just say “I’m not into any of that weird stuff” 

I’m completely at lost at this situation. I wanted to trust that he just wanted to sext someone.  But I can’t get over the fact that he would even pay for a random hook up app.  He’s very cautious with money, and he would never pay for something he’s not going to use.  The fact that he downloaded the app the day I left for my first work trip was mind shattering too.  


Not sure if I should start planning an exit strategy or give him another go.",2019-07-07 15:45:22,7,1,relationship_advice
275,ca62zx,ffjejo,Girl I like (19F) said she needs time before seeing me(20M). Don't know what to do," 

(English is not my first language, if something is unclear, let me know)

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so we have some kind of backstory, for the past year we have been friends with benefits, but not very active. We only met up for sex around 4 times and besides that i just talked to her as a friend. I feel really comfortable with her and so does she with me(At least that is what she said). After a while i caught some feelings for her so i just told her and asked if she wanted to give it a shot. She rejected me politely, saying it's poor timing because she is seeing someone she likes right now, and would have said yes if that wasn't the case. I said it's fine and just left it there, we didn't have contact for around 2 months.

&amp;#x200B;

So this is the tricky part for me. 2 weeks ago i had a really bad headache around 4 am and i was out of paracetamol, at the same time she send me a snap that she was biking home(She started sending me snaps again a couple days before the headache). So i asked ""I have a really bad headache and im out of painkillers, do you have any that i can pick up?"". She said ""Yes I will be home in about 3 min, come over"". So i did and we had a little conversation about how she is doing and how things are working out between her and that guy she liked. She told me that it's over and that he is a jerk(Don't know what happened between those two). I asked if she wanted to do something together some day, she said """"yes i would love to,but first i need some time to get over the break-up, so i can be sure u are not a backup plan or a second choice, i dont want to hurt your feelings"" I said okay I understand and then i left.

&amp;#x200B;

A week after i run into her in a club, we hugged and she suggested to take some shots. Then after 5 minutes she asked if i wanted to talk outside so i said sure. She told me she was really interested in me but she wasn't really comfortable with me being there with her, because she is not ready yet and still needed some time before seeing me. I said I understand and just left to do my own thing. I think she kinda overreacted because i was just chilling there, nothing serious. So i started thinking maybe she doesnt want to see me after all, and maybe she just doesn't want to reject me again(Maybe i'm overreacting this time).

&amp;#x200B;

The club thing was 2 weeks ago and we have some contact every now and then, like sending a meme or something. I'm wondering if she is really interested and really needs time or if she is just not telling me the honest truth. Also i don't want to ask her out, because i would seem like a needy person.

&amp;#x200B;

I do really like her and want to see her, but at the same time respect her choices.

What do you think she thinks, and what is the right move for me to do?

277,ca55mh,Saechan_89,My (30F) husband (34M) is uninterested in sex.,"So I have been with my husband for almost 3 years and married for a little over a year. Before we were married  we didn't live together but we had sex pretty much  every time we saw each other which, nearer to the wedding, was almost every day. We have both always had high sex drives so I never thought this would be an issue.
It seems like ever since we got married his sex drive just completely died. We have had sex but it is very rare. Maybe once a month or so. Sometimes less. I have tried talking to him about it on several occasions but the only conclusion we can come up with is that he is stressed about work, etc.. Good to know, but it doesn't exactly help him to want to have sex. I feel I should point out that he is looking for another job but he didn't finish high school and has a few limiting physical issues which make it hard to find work.
I have tried all the normal stuff people have told me. Trying to initiate just ended up with me having my feelings hurt because he didn't want to so I stopped that quickly. I masturbate frequently but it isn't really helping as much as I had hoped. Also, I feel extremely stupid masturbating with my husband laying right next to me. I have tried to ask him what kinds of lingerie he thinks are sexy and he said ""You just end up taking it off so what is the point?"" Which is a fair point but is the second most irritating thing he has ever said to me.( It was only beaten by ""Pineapple on pizza is delicious!"") I have tried things I know he is into like shaving but still gets a reaction like ""Oh. That's nice"" The only other advice people give you is to talk about it. Which we did. We know the problem but we also are at a loss for how it can be helped so it was kind of pointless. I feel like a huge bitch because I know it isn't his fault. Other than this issue we have basically the perfect relationship. We support each other and talk out our differences and we both have the same morals and mostly the same view points. We love being together and we are together most of the time.
I am mainly trying to fix this issue before I start to resent him. I can feel it already because I have less sympathy about it and just feel pissed off when I think about it. I have been really passive aggressive about it which I hate but the snide remarks just slip out. I can tell he feels bad when I bring it up and when he does feel like doing it we both very much enjoy it. I just wish we had the sex life we had before we were married. The last straw was when he showed me a fanart of Raven from Teen Titans he posted where he wrote ""This is basically my wife"" and my mind went to ""she has a different hair color than me."" So I asked if he wanted me to dye my hair. He seemed a bit confused by my reaction. I realized I was a bit desperate for ANYTHING that would pique his interest. I still plan to dye my hair cuz he seemed a bit into it.
Neither of us want to get divorced so if that is your only advice don't waste my time or yours. I just want some fresh ideas. 
Tldr : My husband's sex drive tanked. I tried all the normal stuff. Need new ideas.",2019-07-07 09:45:12,15,3,relationship_advice
278,ca42jt,CouldBeAThrowawaydon,I have a problem and idk what to do,"So basically it pains me to see my ex with someone else. I was going to marry her. Two weeks after she left me I was supposed to ask her to marry me. She left because she got ""bored"" which doesn't make sense... something flipped in her head right then and there and she wasn't letting up.

She even wanted to marry me and told me 24 hours before she left. I don't know what happened. She said she didn't see a future with me anymore and it was so sudden. She didn't know I was going to ask her this.

So seeing her with someone else kills me inside. I spent years with this woman and to see her with someone else is so excruciating. 

She just up and left after convincing me she was all in, acted like she was all in, and even spoke the words""Marry me?"" As a joke but obviously she wanted it. And for her to say that.... and turn around and leave is painful. 

I've tried coping with this. I've tried doing what I can. Joining gyms, joining church groups, going out as much as I can.


But everything leads back to her. Everything reminds me of the things we did together. 

How the fuck do I get over this? I'm miserable because I loved her with all my heart for her to just up and leave.",2019-07-07 06:57:55,15,5,relationship_advice
279,ca8524,Emerwees,BF of 5 Years Doesn’t Know If We’ll Ever Get Married?,"Guys I just don’t really know how to feel here and need some advice/clarity.

Last night I surprised my boyfriend with a nice hotel and night out away from our kids (3yrs and 1yr old) because life has just been hitting hard the past few months.

We had a great night. I got kind of drunk which I don’t do very often and after a great night out and some bomb sex we were cuddling and I straight up asked him if he thinks we’ll ever get married someday. This IS a conversation we’ve had in the past and the answer has always been “of course! I love you and want to be with you forever”. We’re only 23 so I’m really not in a major rush for this, I’m not sure why I asked but I did and I was met with a shrug and a “I don’t know”. Drunk me didn’t say much except something alone the lines of figure it out, we’re buying a house and if you’re not going to marry me someday let’s not take these steps....he didn’t really say anything and I fell asleep right after.


Does this mean I’m never getting married? 
I feel like I want to have a sincere talk about our future but I’m honestly nervous not and not sure how to approach it. 

I know marriage is scary and I’m really not wanting to rush but goddamn man it’s been 5 years and we have two kids, shouldn’t he know for a fact if he wants to be with me forever or not??",2019-07-07 15:39:01,6,1,relationship_advice
280,ca53z2,dbTAno69,Its 3AM and I want to go to bed - but anxiety around my relationship is keeping me up,"It's actually 4AM at this point but I've been up for about an hour googling relationship advice.  This is not the first time.  Seems whenever I wake up in the middle of the night for the past year my brain loves diving deep into my relationship doubts.

I've (33M) been in a relationship (w/ 31F) for almost 9 years and I'm unhappy.  Was long distance for 2 years, then we moved to the same city down the street from each other for 2 years, I tried to break up and she moved away.  We had no contact for about 2 weeks then I caved in.  Continued long distance for another 2 years then asked her to move in thinking it would help.  3 years later and I'm still unhappy.  Now we're both in our early 30s and I don't know what the hell to do.

It's about every 6 months that I blow up and describe to her why I'm unhappy - zero sex life, poor communication, disrespect, never listens to me, her laziness but nothing changes. 

I let us go 8 months without having sex seesh.  I've told her so many times I would do whatever she wants but she just keeps telling me it's her and she would work on it.  At this point my libido has been affected and I don't really want to have sex either anymore.  In almost 9 years I can tell you 1 time she did something sexy for me.  Heck, 1 time she initiated sex.  One time after communicating my feelings she told that the average couple has sex once a week.  This was her response after months of a dead bedroom.

Every time I blow up and start laying out my feelings she goes silent or starts bawling crying.  Or she tells me she is going to work on it and month later it's like it never happened and shes's talking again about our future together yet nothing has changed.  Am I going crazy or am I just a pushover?

I work a high stress job with a long commute that supports a lot of our lifestyle.  So many times I come home and she is plopped on the couch, no dinner, no cleaning.  I do everything and don't sit down until 9.  The only time something nice is done for me is my birthday.  Even that's a stretch.  I think it was 3 years ago on my birthday she took control because one of her friends was in town.  I've developed the same attitude.  I've told her I was a romantic at one point in my life - flowers, notes, little things.  That's long gone.  Buy her something expensive on her birthday, leave it at that.  She blames my last girlfriend for ruining me.  Heh.  

We have minimal similar interests and don't really budge either way.  I never thought this would be a big issue but lately I keep longing for a PIC (partner in crime) instead of someone I can play house with.   Found myself lately trying to change her which I hate myself for doing.  ""I need you to be different,"" is the phrase I believed I used.   On the flip side to get her to change or do anything out of the norm it HAS to come from someone different.  Literally I ask her to try something or change something for months with no response.  Someone else says it once and it's a good idea.

So why haven't I left?  Besides that I'm just a pushover, this woman loves me so damn much.  Always giving me sweet kisses, telling me how much she loves me.  Telling me I'm a good person and will make a good dad.  Her family loves me, my family loves/likes (I've shared all of this with my one sister who is now suspect on her).  It's been 9 freaking years.  So many adventures, trips, emotions, TIME together.  I don't want to hurt her and leave her in her 30s lost. I want it to work so bad, but I'm...just...unhappy.  And I've been this way for a long time.  I thought moving in together would help but I'm in the same spot I was 3 years ago.  I'm thinking couples counseling.  Honestly I don't know what else to do anymore.  I plan on sharing my current state of mind soon/again, it's been only about 4 months since the last time though.  I can't allow another cycle - blow up, promises of change, nothing changes, repeat.

I need to do something different.  We need to do something.  I want to move forward in life.  House, kids, dog (a dog she does not).  I've been stuck, we've been stuck.

Any advice?  Time to crawl back in bed.",2019-07-07 09:38:18,3,3,relationship_advice
281,ca83dr,TerminallyChill94,I (25M) am struggling to take the next step with GF (25F) of 6 years due to family pressure,"I met my girl my last year in high school and have been dating her since. There have been some bumps in the road along the way such as going long distance in college, and other personal differences but nothing severe enough to the warrant splitting or taking an extensive break. 

The biggest challenge we've had along the way was dealing with my families conservative culture regarding relationships. Im a first generationer so naturally I feel trapped between my family's culture and American culture. I won't go into detail, but we did a lot of sneaking around in my teens and early 20s to ensure we still got to spend time together. 

I am at a point where I am 1 year out of college and working full time. She is also out of college and working full time. I live with my parents and she lives with her sister. We spend so much time already that we are considering moving into a 1 bedroom appt. We've been discussing this for months and I was admittedly apprehensive at first because I've heard so many horror stories about shacking up. Furthermore, bc I know my family won't support my decision I've been nervous about not having a safety net if things end up not working out. I couldn't help but wonder if it's a better idea for us to both just get our own apartments/roommates. 

Despite these fears, we agreed to try it out. Now my biggest challenge is actually having this type of conversation with my family. I know as a 25 yr old, this is something that should be no issue. But I have always had trouble communicating with my parents. After fighting to do so many things growing up with protective parents, I've grown to avoid conflicts and rocking the boat. I casually brought it up in conversation to my mom a month ago and she almost had a heart attack.  I know if I was moving out by myself it would be no problem, but the cohabitation makes it complicated.

I want to firmly tell them of my plans this week but not sure the best way to handle if things go south. I wanted to see if anyone has any advice dealing with this type of situation. Thanks.",2019-07-07 15:34:53,6,1,relationship_advice
282,ca5zri,throowawayy__,"Hooked up with my best friend's ex-girlfriend, need some help","(Throwaway account because my best friend knows my main.)

So I \[M20\] just got back from college three weeks ago, and during this time I've been hanging out with my best friend's ex, let's call her Sarah. Sarah and my best friend (Luke) dated during senior year of high school and some of college, altogether almost a year. When they broke up, Luke was heartbroken and it took him a very long time to get over her (Even now, two years later, he still seems to have feelings for her even though he doesn't talk about her very much.) I was never really that close with Sarah, pretty much until this break.

Sarah and I started hanging almost every day at the start of break, just stuff like going to the mall or playing Minecraft in her basement, and I sort of felt like I needed to hide this from Luke, who I have also been hanging out with almost every day, even though we hadn't done anything besides hung out. That was until two days ago, when we hooked up and had sex and really quickly developed feelings (although not that strong) for each other. I've had to turn my location off on Find my Friends multiple times so Luke wouldn't know I was at her house, although I think he's figured it out.

Tonight, me and Sarah were hanging out at her place and wanted to go smoke weed with my other friend, Matthew, but he was at Luke's house. So we drove over and it was kind of obvious after about 5 minutes that Luke was really uncomfortable and somewhat depressed from the situation, and we awkwardly left after a while. 

Anyways, Sarah is leaving tomorrow to another country for study abroad for 6 months, and it kind of hurts to see her go but I know we couldn't have anything anyway. However, I need advice on what to do with the situation. I'm pretty sure our close friends are pretty suspicious of me turning off my location, because I never do it, and I think they've pretty much assumed that we're hooking up, although me and Sarah told each other we would keep it a secret. Do I tell Luke what's been happening and come clean? Do I lie to him and say nothing has been going on? or do I never mention it ever and keep it a secret to the grave? I really value him as a friend and I feel really bad for doing this, and I was also extremely hesitant with hooking up with her, but also it's been two years since Sarah and Luke broke up, and if he's still mad about it it's kind of his problem....

I'm just not sure what to do, I just want to keep all my friends and kind of forget about the whole thing. Any advice is greatly appreciated!",2019-07-07 11:46:52,7,2,relationship_advice

She hates her job, and has been trying to get a different job for some time now 6-8 months. The market is flooded with business degrees like most, so the space is competitive. We have gotten into several fights regarding this issue and I really am losing my mind. 

She throws it in my face that I could make all the payments and she could pull from her 401k for a month until she found something else. I think this is not only stupid, but plain wishful thinking. She is convinced if she had no job now she could “focus” on applying for more jobs and have one instantly. I think otherwise. 

Although I ‘could’ take on all the payments, it would really be pushing it as my student loans are accumulating every day and are already out of control. I get being unhappy isn’t ideal, but she needs to find a job while she is already working. 

It makes me scared she would suggest pulling from her 401k since she is young and doesn’t care. She is the business professional, and that is just terrible logic. This is the time to be building the 401k.

288,ca7wl1,throwawaiasd,(24f) I’m dating someone I really like but he hasn’t seen me with my glasses on and I look super different.,"Even writing that out, it looks stupid and superficial, I know. I don’t know, maybe I could do with a kick up the butt about it?

Essentially I’ve gone on a couple of dates with a guy now who I think there may be genuine potential with. I’ve had a history of dating guys that haven’t made me feel good about myself at all but with this one we really get along, we have a lot in common and I can tell he genuinely likes me. 

The thing is, he’s only seen me with contacts in; not in my glasses which I normally wear day to day. Also he’s only seen me wearing makeup but I don’t think that’s as much of a deal because makeups quite obvious isn’t it. So I’ve definitely dolled myself up for dates whereas day to day I’m in glasses. 

“They’re just glasses, don’t be stupid” right? Well not really. I feel like my glasses completely change how my face looks (because the prescription is sooo strong) and gives me a whole different vibe. Maybe because they make my eyes a lot smaller? I have been told by countless people how much better I look without glasses and have literally been told I am unrecognisable and look like a different person. Also I am just not as confident. 

I know it’s my own fault for presenting a false picture and not showing him my day to day self on our dates but he’s mentioned a few times how attractive he finds me and I keep chickening out of meeting him with my glasses on. He’s even asked to see pictures and I haven’t shown him. What if I meet him and it’s really awkward because he’s just not attracted to me? I’m almost scared of his reaction. Do I just rip the bandaid off? Send him some pictures of me in glasses so he can make the decision not in front of me? Deal with the likely consequences because it’s my fault anyway?

I don’t know why this is such a big deal when it sounds so stupid but it’s genuinely troubling me :(

Also, I have genuinely had a guy I’ve dated say “wow, how do you go from a 10 to a 6 just putting glasses on?”  So I’m not just making it up!

**tldr** I look and feel like a different person when I have my glasses on and no makeup. Dating a guy who finds me really attractive and kind of terrified for him to see me with them on. What do?",2019-07-07 15:16:57,19,1,relationship_advice

&amp;#x200B;

I'm \[25M\] in a relationship for the past 7.5Y with my girlfriend \[25F\] which has been my fiance for about 2y now.

We started off  in something what a lot of people on here call the honeymoon phase, lots of attention for each other in terms of normal, mental and physical interaction. She was already showing less self interest in sex before i proposed. Which was fine, you gotta stop humping like rabbits at some point. I proposed, she said yes and not to long after we also bought a house together as that was already in our schedule of ideas. Since we have moved in here sex drive has gone down to nearly a complete halt unless i straight up ask for it. Now me being me, i'm not the kind of guy is gonna sit there and ask for it like its a piece of candy. She has self said she has 0 sex drive past years and has zero idea's or reason as to why. Now i can't do much about it if she doesn't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to engage a lot myself but at some point... you start to not bother anymore either. Now to say that we should give up our relationship over sex when in general everything is fine would be stupid. I've tried to imagine solutions or ideas that could help or fix our problem and usually i end up in ( might be a stupid try but eh ) us trying to find a potential 3rd person into our relationship that could maybe fill the attention blanks for each other that we have at the moment.

I love everything about her, she is one of the kindest souls I know but I still have this voice in my head that keeps telling me that I should break up but at the same time I don't think I would really want to leave her.

Nothing is wrong with the relationship, her family, her mental state, ... everything is perfect. I should really be thankful to have her in my life but everything I do with her always feels like a chore. I don't look forward to our dates, sometimes I do but most of the time I don't, I also don't know if I would really be bothered if she would leave tomorrow. I mean I would feel bad but I know I will get over it. It sucks so much to have this feeling of breaking up because every time I look at her and see her all happy and such I just feel bad that I'm having these thoughts. Literally, there is NOTHING wrong with the relationship but I just don't feel like it anymore or something?? 

I have never been really good at relationships because I usually back up eventually as I lose interest but this is the first girl I actually imagine myself marrying with. It makes me feel really confused. Usually I don't have a problem with breaking up because it doesn't bother me hurting the other person but this time I just feel like I can't because she really doesn't deserve to feel hurt. I don't know what to do. I know I have to be honest with her but if I just can't bring myself to tell her... I really love her, maybe I'm just not 'in love', idk..

So I'm super down about this because she is a super sweet girl and our relationship has been going pretty well over this past year. However, ever since we started dating I've just had this feeling that it's just not meant to be. 


She hasn't done anything wrong and neither have I. We haven't fought or argued before either.


The thing is I don't see her as my best friend. Nor do i see her becoming so if i were to stay with her. I just don't feel we bond in that way. Having your partner as your best friend is a big thing for me. I want to feel comfortable doing anything around her but i just don't. 


I'm planning on breaking up with her in 2 days when we see each other again but I just don't know how I should do it. I know I will break her heart regardless but I want to be able to tell her it's nothing to do with her, it's just that I'm not feeling it with our relationship.

Everywhere I step look and sit has dog hair and he isn’t the cleanest person about picking it up.  It really bothers me but I don’t know how to talk about it. Since I don’t live with him I don’t know if it’s my place to say something.  If I did move in with him we would have to have this discussion.  Today for example I want to stay another night with him but all the dirty ness and dog hair is getting to me :( .  Plus he leaves the cats food dish on the counter where we prepare our food 🤮.

293,ca7v35,Throwaway56465434234,I've (M32) met the woman of my dreams (38F) online but she's married with kids and I am a unemployed virgin who lives with his parents.,"I have suffered with anxiety, depression and felt suicidal since I was in my early teens, have not had a job since I was 21 and spend most of my life at home online.  A couple of months ago I was on a message board site, run by a mental health charity where I met this girl. She messaged me thanking me for a comment I made on one of her posts she'd made on the public wall and we started off chatting  about a movie that my alias was a reference to.

&amp;#x200B;

After a few days of back and forth messages on there she suggested using WhatsApp as it was more convenient. I was a bit hesitant as I hadn't actually given my number to anybody online, even people I had spoken to for years. But something about her and the way we'd been chatting overrode those concerns and I gave her my number.

&amp;#x200B;

Initially I believed I was getting catfished, her profile was of a really gorgeous looking woman. I know mental health can affect everybody no matter what their circumstance are or what they look like but my initial reaction was she was too good looking to be real. The catfish theory grew stronger when her first messages were really over the top praise about my picture saying things like ""I can't believe how cute you are"" and emojis of smiling faces with love heart eyes. I am a 32 year old, out of shape, pale and balding depressed guy and she looked like a model or movie star. It wasn't adding up. However, I didn't give my number hoping for any kind of romance, up until now all we'd talked about was mental health problems, movies and what food we liked. So I subtly aired my concerns and she assured me that was her in the picture and even sent multiple other pictures, I requested a random picture of her with one thumb up, her left eye closed and a grape in her mouth (she had told me she was eating grapes at the time) and she sent the picture confirming to me that she was in fact genuine and I was actually talking to this amazingly attractive woman.

&amp;#x200B;

Once I'd established she was genuine I got another major surprise when we asked each other where we were from (we both knew we were from the UK). I live in a relatively small town that most people haven't heard of but not only had she heard of the town, she was only about 15 miles away! This knocked us both a bit, I don't think either had expected it but after the initial shock we both decided it was quite nice that we weren't on the opposite ends of the country and it made it possible to eventually meet some point down the line depending on how things went. It was only 15 miles but I don't drive and rarely leave the house at all so it might as well had been 1500 miles for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Things went amazingly for the first week on WhatsApp, we spoke about anything and everything, got to know each other and I ended up being able to really open up telling her things I never told anyone else in my life. We'd message each other from the morning until around 8 at night when she'd go quiet. After that first week she began to ask for more pictures of me, even though I said I was just sitting in my room gaming she would insist and it was around then I kept picking up suggestions she wanted to start talking sexually. Some were subtle but then some less so for example, I'd send a picture and have my bed in the background and she'd comment like ""If I was in that bed would you come and play with me instead?"" and send various suggestive emojis. I got caught up in it and flirted back and before I knew it basically all we spoke about involved sex. She'd send pictures of her in underwear or naked and covered by a sheet and message quite explicitly things she wanted to do to me or me to do to her.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd told her everything about me living with my parents, being a virgin and how I was extremely shy and uncomfortable around women in particular but it didn't seem to bother her at all. After a few days of the sex chat she sent a picture of her in the car saying how she wanted to come around if my parents were out and I noticed a baby seat on the back seat. So I asked her and this is when I found out that she had a daughter and a young son and then eventually revealed she was married too. She asked if I minded and I said it didn't matter to me, I wasn't actively looking for a relationship anyway and with all my mental health problems, lack of employment or my own place it was never realistic anyway.  It explained why she would always go quiet around 8 in the evening as that would be when her husband always got back from work and I wondered did she just had a thing for turning on unattractive, out of shape virgin guys and it was just a bit of fun for her the whole time. She confided in me that she didn't really love her husband any more, they hadn't had sex in years since their son was born and she was only staying with him for the sake of the children.

&amp;#x200B;

We continued to message but it was more like the early days of talking about movies, food and stuff but occasionally the talk would turn towards sex. I mentioned during one of these times that I really fancied Scarlet Johansson especially with the red hair when she plays Black Widow in the Marvel movies and the very same day she sent me a picture, she'd dyed her hair red like Black Widow! After the initial excitement of seeing her looking exactly like one of my fantasies it hit me that it was a bit crazy if she would completely change her look based off me saying I had a thing for Scarlet Johansson.  But she told me it was something she actually thought about doing for a while and already had the dye before I had said anything and she just chose that day to finally get around to doing it.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been almost 2 months now since we started messaging on WhatsApp and we've arranged to meet up. I selected a public park that I know quite well about 15 minutes walk from my house that she says she has been to a few times before so knows how to get there. Initially she suggested to meet and have sex but when I talked about never even meeting a girl for a date before, kissing or anything she was quite reassuring and said we didn't have to have sex or do anything I was uncomfortable with but then said she was down for anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not know what to do. These past couple of months are the first time I have ever really felt anything positive about myself in years and I have been actively starting to work out to get in better shape physically to look better for her. She has been nothing but positive and complimentary but I still have reservations whether she will like me. We've spoke on the phone and video chat and I did send a picture of me in just shorts yet somehow she still claims to like and want me. On top of all that there is the morality of meeting up with someone who's married and has children as well as the fact we met on a mental health website, he profile was pretty blank and whenever I tried talking about her issues she was pretty casual about it saying she just felt ""down from time to time, nothing serious"" but part of me wonders if she has more going on.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really like some advice. Should I call off the meet? Go but just to meet and talk? Go and let her do some of the things she's talked about? Break things off and have no contact? These are all things I have thought about but as I say, I don't know what to do.  This weekend she has gone away to Scotland with her family so for the first time since initially messaging we have not spoken at all since Friday. She is coming back on Monday night and our meeting is planned for Thursday as her son will be going to her parents that day, the daughter will be at school and husband at work.",2019-07-07 15:13:02,16,0,relationship_advice
294,ca7uav,Lightdragonman,How do I move past my mother's actions,Years ago my mother engaged in an affair with some dude in another state and lied to my family about it. The thing is she couldn't really take so many trips to Minnesota without a reason so she would take me with her and drop me off at my sister's while she engaged in whatever she did with him. I met the man a few times and she would always tell me he is a friend. My 13 year old self figured the affair out after I heard him say some lowkey flirty stuff to her. I didn't tell my dad though and eventually my family split up. I've since grown up but seeing her do what she did put a bad taste in my mouth and I still can't fully interact with her without a degree of doubt towards her. I've gone to therapy and talked about this experience but I still can't seem to forgive and forget. Her and I still talk and she visits but I can never muster up the will to visit her in Minnesota. I don't want my family to stay disconnected but seeing her do what she did and the results of it has made me cold towards her. I would talk to her about it but I am afraid I'll just get yelled at and possibly cut off from her as a family member.,2019-07-07 15:10:55,6,1,relationship_advice

(we speak every day, and usually see each other every evening)

&amp;#x200B;

however, one of our mutual friends has made me aware he's actually just gone to a four day festival for what I can only assume to be a four day drug/alcohol binge (I assure you this is not a light assumption, but based on my experience of his behaviour over the last two years).

&amp;#x200B;

i don't have an issue with him going out, whatever, but i just think it's so cruel to leave me in the dark about things like this when he knows i worry about his drug/alcohol use, and if i hadn't been told by a mutual friend then i would have no clue what was going on

Some history- when I first started dating fiancé (F) my mom was cold and seemed to hate him. I think it was because previously I had been with a woman that she approved of and she wanted grandbabies. She didn't want a gay childless son (even though we want kids). Eventually she got over it and seemed to fully approve of and accept F, which is huge. In past relationships, F was forced to remain in the closet while his 'boyfriend' had girls around for show. He wasn't accepted by that family at all. So being loved by my family is huge. 

Now, last night was a family party (my side). At this point we're engaged and the family has all met. End of the night, we (me, F, my mother, and a sibling of mine) were talking. Mom is drunk, F is naturally sassy at times. Mom starts trying to empart some parenting knowledge on us. F jokingly says ""Oh here we go!"". My mom FLIPS. Stands up, starts telling F to fuck off and fuck you and calling him an asshole as she stomps upstairs. F says ""fuck this"" and leaves to walk home, not wanting to say anything. I found my mom, told her off, and left to find F. 
Now F is extremely hurt and I don't know  what to do. He told me to figure out my family before I go back.

298,ca7ovf,ThrowSaved543,9 years in and I'm emotionally signing out but unsure about everything..,"My (28F) relationship with my boyfriend (32M) has been a bit rocky for a few months. I posted some bits in CF a couple of months ago (TDLR: I don't want kids, I'm pretty sure he does) for anyone interested and the air has still not been cleared. We had a few emotional days back then and I was prepared to walk away, but I caved. I agreed that we shouldn't throw away 9 years because he doesn't know if he wants children. 

Fast forward to now. 

We spoke today. I told him how I was feeling. That I have been distancing myself from him because I'm uncertain about our future and the kids issue hadn't been resolved for me, it's been lingering. Through our conversation he said something along the lines of 'you could change your mind' and I feel its been reconfirmed for me that he is (perhaps unknowingly) holding onto that hope. He ultimately said it isn't a conversation for now. 

I also told him that it's not just about kids anymore, unfortunately. I'm now questioning everything. I've let this snowball. 

What are our future plans? What does he want to achieve? Where does he see us going? .. And he didn't really have an answer. He's coasting along and he's happy with it. 

He said marriage was what he had seen next but I said that wasnt enough and there's more to it. He honestly didn't have anything else to add. 

It's been left with agreeing that we'll try to rekindle and regroup. He's been downstairs for a couple of hours so I have no idea what he's thinking or doing, but I'm giving him some space.. 

I dont know if I'm just being a weak person and I'm too uncertain just to call it. I feel like I firm up what I'm thinking until I speak to him and then he makes me doubt everything. 

Our relationship has been good for years but honestly feel like his housemate more than anything at the moment. There's no intimacy and I appreciate that this is entirely my fault. We both definitely have communication issues. He's also so laid back that having a meaningful conversation is like drawing blood from a stone. 

I'm not really sure what I'm doing basically. Any insight, tough words, advice would be welcome..

TLDR: Relationship isn't going too well, do I need to just call it?",2019-07-07 14:56:44,4,1,relationship_advice
299,ca5q7t,AM7322,My (M18) Anxious thoughts are subconsciously ruining my relationship with my girlfriend (F18). How do I reverse these effects?,"There was a time when I was feeling apathy because of my new job at McDonald’s which was mind numbing. I even felt apathetic towards my girlfriend when a couple days before, I felt such a passionate love for her. Then I started to worry that it was just me losing feelings for her because I compared this to another situation when I was flirting with a girl in the past and nothing more, then I was feeling the same exact way and I stopped talking to her. I started thinking these irrational thoughts that it’s that I’m not letting go of her and that she’s holding me back that it’s the reason why I’m apathetic. I started to think about things that people usually do when they lose feelings for someone they used to love. They get annoyed at every little thing their SO does, they start to become distant, their SO becomes less attractive to them, they may even flirt with other people or cheat. Because I thought so much about those actions, I slowly started to have all those traits, except cheating. Even though I would never do that, I essentially tricked myself into becoming tempted to cheat, and thinking that my girlfriend is unattractive when she’s nowhere near ugly. I became so fixated on those thoughts that I prolonged the feeling of apathy from what should’ve lasted a couple days, to weeks. I just realized this all today, and I want to stop this problem from going any longer. My girlfriend is an amazing, hard working, beautiful girl that gives her all to me, and I know I’d be stupid to drop something that’s working out so well. Anybody have any advice on how to stop this self destructive path so I can go back to loving my girlfriend? Thank you",2019-07-07 11:10:20,0,2,relationship_advice
300,ca7ok0,07291i,I (20M) think I’m obsessed with my ex (21M),"So its a bit embarrassing but basically I dated him for about 19 months or so, and we broke up recently. 
I’ve been feeling pretty insecure because he seemed less enthusiastic at the idea of talking to me or spending time together, or just showing love. I could FEEL something was not right. When I asked him about it, he said there’s nothing wrong and that he loves me. I tried to convince myself that nothing was wrong and that I was being paranoid. This happened again and again for about 2 weeks until one day, just after saying he really loved me he said « But I feel like somethings missing in our relationship. Not enough passion, both from you and myself » So I told him that if he wasn’t feeling it, we should just break up because I couldn’t afford to feel bad all the time, or to force him to love me. I know it sounds like I didn’t even try to make any effort to save the relationship but it’s mainly because the same thing happened like 4 months before that. I felt anxious because he would change, then we’d break up because he didn’t love me anymore. Eventually he’d start to flirt again and try to get back with me, I agreed because obviously I loved him, still. Since that first time I tried different stuff, and apparently it was all pointless. 
Well since the second breakup, we agreed to stay friends because neither of us could imagine life without each other and he kinda said that I was his best friend anyway and the best person in the world to him. I thought : well sweet I guess. 
The problem is I personally still love him romantically and I can’t help it, I stalk his social media, the people he talks to just to see if he’s going to flirt with other people. I know it’s bad and pathetic but I really can’t help it. A friend told me that it was because I often isolated myself with him and that I needed to talk to other people but the thought doesn’t seem appealing at all, I want his attention, I want to talk to him only most of the time. 
I don’t know if something’s wrong with me because I have a bunch of exes and after we broke up (even if I still loved them) I just detached myself pretty easily. 
I want him to be happy but only if it’s with me, I can’t stand the thought of someone being more important to him than me. This is so disgusting. 

So is it normal? Or do I need to see someone that can help me deal with that?",2019-07-07 14:55:52,1,1,relationship_advice
301,ca5pc9,throwaway_1998_09,Not sure if I [19F] should stay with my boyfriend [20M] in the long run,"I want to preface this with saying that I know that we are both still young, and I should probably not be thinking so hard about these things, but I can't help but worry about the future. I've talked about this with my friends/family but I guess I would just like more advice/a larger variety of views to consider.

&amp;#x200B;

For a little background information - BF and I have been together for almost two years, have discussed marriage and he seems to be quite content with the idea of getting married. This is the first relationship either of us has been in, and I wouldn't really mind getting married in the future either. I will be graduating from college next year, and am hoping to land a graduate placement or at least receive a decent job offer within the first 6 months after graduation. He is still in his first year of college due to changing majors. Overall, we have a good relationship, and are pretty compatible.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm worried about our future together, mainly because I think that he is not very... motivated/driven? I've always been pretty book smart, but this resulted in me putting the absolute minimum amount of effort into any academic thing I've ever had to do - which has changed because I personally think that my college transcript will play an important(ish) role in getting a job in my field. However, despite how unmotivated and, admittedly, lazy, I am, I feel that he is even more unmotivated than me. From what I have seen, he plays games a LOT, studies considerably less than me (which is the equivalent of &lt;3 hours a week and essentially only cramming before exams), sleeps/wakes up late etc. His money management is also not the best, which is both good and bad because he is not stingy, but also spends money on random thing/eats out a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe financial independence and security are extremely important, which is probably due to the fact that my parents constantly argued about money when I was growing up. I always feel anxious about money even though, realistically, I am middle/almost upper-middle class. I know it's selfish/shallow, but what I have always wanted in a partner is someone who is 'better' than me - smarter, more financially stable, better at the same sports that I play etc. Essentially someone I could 'idolize' in a way that makes me want to improve myself to match them. I know that BF has potential, but I don't want to have to be the one to 'nag' him to do certain things (i.e. study more, eat healthier) - I don't want to be the one that is 'better'.  

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing that makes me question whether we should stay together (despite no obvious/actual issues) is the fact that he wants to have children, while I am still on the fence about it but am leaning towards not having any. Reason being that I am terrified of having to give birth and the changes my body will undergo (shallow, yes - C-sections also leave you with a scar). This is probably because I'm still young (and shallow ahaha), but I'm also scared of raising my child badly.  

&amp;#x200B;

I know we're still young, and nothing is set in stone, but I can't see any issue that would lead to us breaking up until we get married. He and I are highly unlikely to cheat, and most other circumstances that would lead to us separating prematurely are also unlikely to happen. However, I don't want to wake up 5 years down the line (whether we are married or not) and realize that I do not want to be with him. I still honestly think we are dating because we live really close.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, the more I type the more I think I'm probably waiting for someone the tell me to break it off with him. Our relationship has no obvious issues, and I think he loves me a lot but I don't know if I feel the same way. Is this because I don't know whether he will be financially stable/independent in the future? Maybe. However, I don't want to wait until we've both graduated to find out, I'm too impatient and don't want to waste time nagging him to change. I also don't think its fair on him to be with someone who doesn't love him unconditionally (or the same way he loves me). I'm not sure what to do; we're both still relatively young, I don't know what I would say if I wanted to have a serious discussion with him about this, and I don't know what I would do if we broke up. I'm scared of losing him and being alone ahaha.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - boyfriend is relatively unmotivated in his studies/life in general - I do not think this is mental health related. I want want someone with good future potential (ideally equal to or better than my own, shallow/selfish, I know) who I can learn from, grow with, 'idolize' etc and I cannot see him changing within the next few years. He also deserves better/someone who will love him how he is. He wants to get married in the future, I am not so sure. I am also unsure whether I want to stay in the relationship in the foreseeable future but am afraid of being alone/without him in my life.

302,ca4t79,acocoroach,I fell in love for a Pentecostal girl but we had to break up,"I've been dating this girls since January and I know we both fell hard for each other. We are both 18. Everything was perfect, I never met a girl I have so much in common with. We were best friends and we were very physical attracted(we slept together for a couple of times but didn't have sex as I respect her decision to stay virgin until marriage).

It was the perfect relationship until her parents told her to break up with me, as a long term relationship won't be good for her as she won't resist without having sex before marriage, and Pentecostal people are not allowed to have relationships in general until they are ready for marriage. When she told me this she started to cry. She was heartbroken and I was shocked. At first she didn't want to obey her parents but I told her it's best that she listens to them, so we broke up, but we kept chatting like lovers and still did couple things, except we didnt kiss or held hands. She told me I had to get baptised so her parents would agree with our marriage later on, and I didn't mind as I don't like the orthodox church. We  swore that even if it gets harder nothing will separate us. 

Then it hit me. A wave of jealousy, anger and insecurity swept me away. I started arguments with her, mocking her beliefs, telling her things like ""If you loved me, you wouldnt have broken up with me"" or ""If I was a Pentecostal your parents wouldn't have told you to break up with me"". I even tried to end my relationship with her, but after telling her this I instantly regretted it and apologised for days.

I hurt her a lot and now she lost trust in me. I guess I am not that mature as I would like to believe. I really feel she is perfect for me, as I dated a lot of girls and no one but her made me want to be a better person. She told me that we should stay friends, and if it is meant to be together we will be one day. I am heartbroken that I lost her trust, and really want to change, to be a better person, so I could make her happy again. I don't think I'll ever be able to have another girl in my mind as long as she is perfect for me.

Later this year we are traveling to my country for a family thing before going to hers for one of her friends weddings. Whilst I'm my country I was wanting to propose, but it would be a week before her friends wedding, and like 4 days before her friends hen's party.

What I am asking is, is this bad taste? Under normal circumstances I think most people would agree a bit too close, however as we live on the other side of the world from our family, we have limited time to do it.

305,ca7kk8,Fuzzy1968,I'm Obsessed,"Back story: terribly unhappy, stressful, sexless relationship x 7 years to a closet alcoholic. I (50, F) ended it, was bitter for two years and didn't want to date. For the last year, I've been loving life: hiking, traveling, visiting friends, volunteering, and didn't want to date. I was in a happy relationship with myself.

Then, on a lark I signed up for a dating site. I figured I'd go out with a couple of guys when I felt like it, quit when I got tired of it, and life would go back the way it was.

Short version: I met Mark, instant chemistry, LOTS of fun and amazing conversations. He inspired me to embrace life even better than I had been. I felt like he breathed new life into me.

Over the two months we dated, he kept talking about Stacy, the woman he'd dated before me. She was a dry alcoholic who would not let go, and he felt bad for her. She did all this melodramatic, near-psycho shit, like leaving gifts on his doorstep and calling him at work, and inviting him over under some pretext, then leaving poems about him where he could see them.

""Why don't you put her out of her misery and cut her off?"" I asked.

""Because I don't want to be a dick. Besides, it's kind of fascinating, like watching a train wreck.""

I pointed out that prolonging her suffering was dickish, and playing spectator to her suffering was cruel. I encouraged him to be compassionate, and quit participating in the drama, and move on. He said he would.

In response to him cutting off contact, she upped the ante and pulled a really convoluted, manipulative move involving their mutual friend, Karen, and Mark's business such that saying, ""No,"" to Stacy also meant saying, ""No,"" to Karen. I pointed out a way he could say no to Stacy, but *not* to Karen, but he said he was going to do things Stacy's way. This involved going over to Stacy's house on a Sunday, when his business was closed, to conduct business with Karen. Absurd.

After two months of this, I realized that A) he was not over Stacy, they were still in a relationship, and B) he was 100% codependent to her alcoholism. I've got zero respect for an untreated codependent. I dumped him flat.

But, we belong to the same service organization, and I had this stupid fantasy that I'd stay away for two months, and during that time he'd start to get his life in order, leave Stacy behind, get serious about counseling. We'd be friends for a while, re-establish trust, then try again. (Thanks, Hollywood!)

I knew, even as I was doing it, that it was stupid and unhealthy, but I used my fantasy as motivation to exercise more, eat better, buy new clothes so that when we met again at the service organization I'd knock his socks off.

He didn't show. Week after week, no Mark. 

""Oh, well!"" I thought. ""I may as well put  this hot bod to good use!"" and went on a series of seven disappointing dates. Each one reminded me of that 'magic in a bottle' I'd experienced with Mark, and I got a little more depressed.

Then, I learned that he'd gone back to dating Stacy full-on after I broke up with him, taking romantic trips, etc.

I've been essentially housebound ever since. I go to work, then home to bed every day.

I've thought about him every day for three months, longer than we actually dated. Thing is: I know it would never work out between us. He's not healthy, and that doesn't change without a lot of time and therapy. I don't respect him for what he's done. I'm obviously not 100% healthy, either. I just can't get over that feeling, that connection, that safe place to be vulnerable and open and totally real, that playfulness and sense of adventure. I had not had that in 10 years. I can't find that again, it was pure luck, and I can't have it alone. 

My life has NOT gone back to the way it was when I was happy alone, in a loving relationship with myself. Now, I'm missing what I had so briefly. I wasn't lonely before; now I am. Terribly  lonely.

What can I do to move past this? I've tried separating the man from the feeling, so I can quit obsessing about him and deal in a healthy way with the latter, but I can't. He lit that fire, flaws and all.",2019-07-07 14:45:07,0,1,relationship_advice
306,ca7jaz,MidnightEfreet,Introducing my boyfriend to my strict asian parents,"So, I have a boyfriend and we've been dating for almost a year now. He's really kind, caring and really sweet. I think it's right to introduce him to my parents. We've been wanting to go out privately (without anybody with us) and I don't want to lie to my parents about it. The problem is, my parents are *Asians*. So, what this basically tells you is that my parents look for standards, wealth, intelligence and other stuff like that in a guy and my boyfriend isn't really kind to other people. He's the sort of guy who would be involved in every fistfight, every problem (you get the point). Another problem is that my parents don't like my boyfriend even before I dated him. YEAH. THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM. I really want to introduce him to my parents but I'm really afraid that my parents would not accept him or even disown me. So, I really need some suggestions guys.

310,ca7g6q,sv_cheats-1,My parents hate gaming,"Completely. I’m a gamer and have been playing since I was 4 (I’ve been sitting near my brother and watching how he was playing Minecraft (the only days when me and he were true bros)). Until I was 8 I’ve been playing GTA:Vice city on my bro’s PSP. Then I got a large iMac with the best setup at that time but ironically a pirate version of Minecraft. That time was *the* time when my parents came along.  I was forbidden from playing gta because “that’s the game where you kill people” and I was only be able to play games for 2 hours on weekends. I then found Steam and asked my dad to buy me Team Fortress 2 which he didn’t want to do but still did (I have 1100+ hours playing it and do not regret about that)
I wasn‘t complaining about that regime for a while because I was learning the world and how it works and didn’t play much. Then I started playing as usual and wasn’t satisfied with the regime. After there was a period when in contrast of solid “A”s I started getting lots of “B”s in school. And you know it, my parents immediately blamed everything on my Mac and gaming , even though they were constantly bullying me (“so that you, [my name], would get back on track”) so hard that I wanted to leave home (I was in the 6th grade btw). And I, of course, played less that time and was bullied harder for that even if I played “legally”.  Then I persuaded many of my teachers to get me out of “bad-marks” state. So started getting “A”s again, but now I’d rather get C than B because for some *mysterious* reasons parents don’t care about bad marks and only focus of Bs. 
So then my dad decided to start mining cryptocurrency and we bought me a nice and pretty beefy PC (I had laptop then). So I set up mining but there a little annoying thing. Even though I had a powerful PC with 2 GTX1060 to play comfortably I had to disable one of them from the mining process and turn them back in when I was done. Of course my dad didn’t like that and was constantly trolling me about it. “We all humans and make mistakes”, says my mum we she messes up, so one day I forgot to connect one of the graphics card back to mining sessions. That was one of the worst days in my life. I was initially restricted from playing any games for a year and beaten up. Then I was pardoned and could play after a week. When mining became inefficient dad decided to stop. Even though I wasted many hours to find the correct cryptocurrency, correct virus-free utility, dealing with all of the problems I got nothing but several beatings for little mistakes. After a time that 2-hours-on-weekends regime stoped and I could play as long as I wanted provided that I do all of the things I should beforehand. 
Because it’s summer that means I have to came up with an idea for a project. You already could’ve guessed that they all are about gaming and parents don’t like it. So my dad asked, I mean forced me to create a little project for out future house. I didn’t want to do that because a) I had experience with Arduino and how everything can suddenly break in the middle of the night (I respect everyone who does great things using Arduino) and b) I had enough torture myself with soldering iron. But I was asked, I mean forced, so…

Week when Steam sales started I wanted to get myself three games: Half Live, Black Mesa and Insurgency: Sandstorm. But because I lent my mum $160 for a month and she would return me then back the next day sales stop and had to ask her to return me some earlier. She was shocked that I told her that I was “technically wasting our (their) money on those games”. That evening I had a conversation with my dad and I felt how he was about to enter his brainwashing machine into my brain  and make me a copy of my brother. I managed to not let him do it, but it made me think wether by the Insurgency because my pc might be too weak for it. I bought it anyway and I do not regret that decision (it’s an awesome game)
Today parents suddenly decided to got to my dad’s grandparents in the middle of nowhere filled with mosquitoes that I afraid of. I didn’t want to go because I didn’t finish my dad’s thing. I told my parents about that and you guessed it they suspected in not finishing but playing games. So I got beaten up for nothing and now I’m here. 

How can I make using “my parents” and “gaming” in one sentence possible?

P.S. my brother was brainwashed by parents and now he thinks that gaming is absolutely terrible. He’s now learning Web programming in university in another city.

P.P.S. I want to become a game developer.

P.P.P.S. this story might sound like a generic gamer story, but at least I’m not a braindead nerd that can’t stop playing at all. I just want find use of gaming and programming to get a dream job.",2019-07-07 14:33:49,3,1,relationship_advice

It's been months since me and this person have been talking via instagram, and it was going really great! They were really nice and caring, and we moved on to messenger so we could have calls and I could contact them without internet and only free data because instagram is a butt. A few months ago, I started to develop feelings for them, they mentioned to me that they were aromantic before and I remember, but still, I started to fall for them. They have been nothing but sincere, nice, honest, and honestly just so amazing, who wouldn't fall in love with them? I decided I'd tell them how I feel, and maybe make something out of it. When I did, they told me that they couldn't get into a relationship, since they gave up on it years ago. I told them I'd wait for them, if they're okay with it, and that I would try my best to hold on to it. They agreed and told me they'd try, but not really a relationship. Lately, we started calling each other endearments, like darling, love, baby, you get it. We even started exchanging I Love You's! They've become a part of my life now and I can't stand the thought of them just disappearing. One day, we were talking about our future and how they wanted me to move to their country and live with them, it honestly made me so excited and fell for them even more. They were so happy to have me in their life, too. Until a few weeks ago, we were talking about labels and they asked, ""You know that I'm aromantic, right?"" I told them yes and continued on with the conversation. They told me we'd still be affectionate and admire each other, and that they were cool with it. But the thing is, I'M not cool with it. I feel like I'm just someone they could go to for affection. Like they could drop me any time if they don't feel like ""loving"" me anymore.

He suddenly says he can't go after I wait for over 3 hours. Should I still consider him a friend?","Backstory,my best friend knows that I have the biggest crush with this girl in our 2nd year high school class. After that,he moved to another school that's a 25 minute car trip. 

Me and my crush are classmates and is friends with my best friend. Best friend plans that the three of us hang out,watch Toy Story 4. He said he will try to get us closer together.

After 2 weeks of cancellation from crush since she's busy,she finally decided to watch today,at the mall Uptown.

There are 2 malls near us,the Uptown and Downtown. Best friend told me we will watch at Uptown. He asked if I can go now,2 hours before our initial meet up,I said yes and he asked me to go now. I waited there for hours and he kept stalling and stalling and stalling,until I find out that crush was gonna watch at the DownTown mall,not Uptown. Suddenly,after 3 hours of waiting and doing nothing,he cancels. I've never been so mad with him in my life. 

My theory is that he just fkn left me there since he also JUST found out that she was at Downtown. Best friend is also a popularity seeker,so it makes sense for him to just leave me. 

I treated him a lot,tried to be nice at all times,and this is how he repays me? By toying with my emotions?

Love each other very much. Were in a LDR. I did a TIFU about the accident. Here is the link to the TIFU:  www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ca5h4n/tifu_by_going_fishing_after_a_night_shift_had_a/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

I went fishing after a night shift, had an altercation with another man, called the cops on him, they didn't believe me. Had a mental breakdown and got drunk. I am still unsure how this happened as I am a very robust, proper person that doesn't consume alcohol. I got in an accident with my bicycle. Woke up at the hospital. I wasn't able to talk to my SO for several hours, and when I did I told her I was in an accident, but that I was fine with no real injuries. 

She asked me some hours later if I had taken anything and then I told her the full story about having a breakdown and chugging vodka out of the bottle. I didn't hide anything. She is now calling me a liar and having trust issues and is rethinking everything. 

I messed up big, but nothing like this has ever happened to me before. I don't know what to do. I don't want to lose her. I don't want a future without her. 

Tldr: got in an accident. Didn't tell my fiance that I had a meltdown and drank alcohol, until she asked. She is now rethinking everything.

Edit: some of you are asking why she's upset. It's because I didn't tell her all the details about the accident, immediately. She's more upset that I left out the alcohol part rather than the accident itself.",2019-07-07 10:47:17,9,2,relationship_advice

I’m still a virgin but I did have one girlfriend in high school. I was born in india but came to the US at about age 3. Even though I was raised in the US, my family is very culturally Indian and I could not see myself married to someone who isn’t Indian in the future, I think the cultural differences would be too much. I’m going off to college this fall but I’m going to a college in a very white part of the US where there are few other Indian Americans and my chances of meeting an Indian American girl (or even an Indian girl from India) in college are very slim, i will basically have to wait until I graduate and move to a bigger, more diverse city to meet an Indian American girl. This college is the best option for me financially and academically, the only thing I don’t like about it is that the student body isn’t very ethnically diverse, its overwhelmingly white. Avoiding relationships throughout college and starting to date after I graduate college isn’t a great option either because most women will think I am weird for being a virgin at age 22 and only having one girlfriend in High school.  

Am i being unreasonable for only wanting to casually date and hook up with non-indian women in college? I want dating experience and sex in college but i do not want to marry outside of my own cultural background either.

So getting back together was very good and we were mainly happy with each other. However due to our nationality differences, we do not speak common language. So I have always kept him apart from my friends and family,  tho he always integrated me in his life including family and friends. He also moved to another country to be closer to me and left the country where he was earning a lot and had his life set pretty much. 

Recently he found out that in the begginning of our 3 years relationship, for around a year, I have been talking to my boy friends from my nationality  (flirtatiously) and have also visited some of them for sleepover.  It got revealed because I have not deleted any of my conversations from my social media accounts, from the time i created them. 

I wasnt able to convince him that I didnt have intercourse or any kind of sex with them, even though i shared a bed with 2 of them ( there were 3 guys in total,that i emotionally cheated on my bf). 

Of course he snapped and it lead to numerous fights, mainly him shouting at me and calling me all kinds of words. He videocalled his ex gf in front of me multiple times, and i wasnt able to say anything cuz all of this is consequences of my actions. 

He has requested me to contact the guys and let him talk to them and confirm that i havent had intercourse with them, which i wasnt ready to do. Also he requested me to record me begging him for forgiveness and sending the video to those guys. He also wanted me to cut my ties with my high school girfriends, who knew about them and I wasnt ready to do that. I still think, he doesnt have authority to ask me for something like that. 

This was going on for around 2 months now and recently he broke up with me. He is in another country and we might meet again at the end of summer. Meantime I am pretty sure he is gonna meet his ex gf and probably meet other girls as well. 

I am so lost, I am not sure how was i supposed to act in this situation to gain his trust back. 
And is there any chance of us getting back together after the summer ? 
And how to manage myself knowing that he is with someone else right now? 
I love him so much and still want him to be with me.",2019-07-07 14:31:13,11,0,relationship_advice
317,ca7f48,anonymous0473,I (20F) am desperate to leave my abusive and toxic family. Am I overreacting or being reckless?,"Hello Reddit, I have never made a post before so apologies in advance if I'm posting in the wrong subreddit or if my formatting is off.

20 years. Literally two fucking decades of my life I've allowed my mom (40F) dad (41M) and brother (23M) to abuse me emotionally, mentally, and physically. In hopes of not making my post too long I'll just get to the events which occurred last night.

It was around 2:30 in the morning and I was laying in my makeshift bed in the living room and scrolling through reddit one last time before trying to get some sleep. I used to have a room but I stayed out past curfew (10 pm) a couple of times and as punishment my dad ordered my mom to throw out all of my belongings and give the room to my little sister. I felt the punishment was a bit extreme but since I'm living in their house under their rules I understand. Going back to last night, my brother gets home extremely intoxicated and is acting angry and violent, which is the norm for him after a night of drinking. We have never had a good relationship. I have tried blocking out a lot of my childhood but from what I can recall, he has always hated and targeted me since we were kids for a reason I never uderstood. While my dad did sometimes attempt to make him stop, my mom would baby him and say his violent outbursts were our fault for ""provoking"" him. As you can probably guess, this enabling caused a lot of tension and fights in the household and it saddens me to say that I've never felt safe in my own home. 

So there I was laying in my bed and my brother comes over to me and begins insulting me and blatantly attempting to puke on me. I understandably get pissed off and start defending myself which causes my mom and dad to come out of their room. A verbal argument ensues and as usual my mom is babying my brother while telling me to shut up because, ""I should know better than to talk back to him when he's drunk."" In an extreme state of rage I dial 911 and when my mom realizes she slaps my phone out of my hand and immediately ends the call and begins berating me for attempting to ""ruin the family"" and saying I'm good for nothing. Not long after I left to a friend's house where I'm currently staying. Whenever I try to have an adult conversation with them after fights like these they tell me that I'm no better than him but I know the only reason they let him treat them that way is because he constantly gives them money.

Due to severe depression and a suicide attempt I've been out of work for a couple of months, although I just had an interview on Friday and got offered a position I will begin as soon as I pass a drug test. My parents have been getting increasingly impatient over the fact I haven't been working, although I am still paying my bills and buying my own food and helping them with what I can. Even though I know I can't afford to move out, I know I can't keep living like this anymore either. If I leave I know I'd probably be homeless for a while but at this point I feel like I don't have anything to lose and I'd be better off. Am I being reckless or should I go for it and take the leap? I'm so scared right now and I have no idea what to do. Feedback greatly appreciated.",2019-07-07 14:31:01,1,1,relationship_advice
318,ca3jqp,TallScore5,My (29M) girlfriend (23F) expressing interest in coworker,"I'll try to keep this short.  Relationship of three years.  I live in her house, but am not financially dependent on her.

&amp;#x200B;

Without getting into a great level of detail, know that I was suspicious and looked through her group chat with her coworkers.  Over the past few months, she has on many occasions voiced to her coworkers the fact that she wants to have sex with a particular guy that works in the same place, but in a different role.  Wants to fuck him, have his babies, suck his dick, run her hands through his hair, feel his muscles and curves, etc.  She said regular bf and work bf are two separate things, and they're both needs that need to be fulfilled.

&amp;#x200B;

The one saving line was that she said nothing would happen between them anyway, because she's faithful.  But she also had me take a picture of her in a bikini at the beach, hoping the guy would notice.  I had no idea at the time.  She vented about an argument we had, to which one of her friends replied ""men suck"".  She said ""except (name)"" followed by six hearts.  Dragged me through the dirt and made me look horrible - and I've never once yelled at her or raised my voice in our three years together.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think the guy is even aware of her infatuation.  I don't think she's physically done anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it was a breach of trust to read her stuff, but the trust was kind of already breached when I felt the need to look to begin with.  I'm going to be honest and say I don't feel bad about doing whatever it took to find out more info, even if this makes me a bad person.

&amp;#x200B;

Given these vague details, what would be the appropriate way for me to navigate this?  I don't want to overreact, but I'm also not cool with it.  She's not home and won't be until tomorrow.

He’s the one I want to be with. We plan on owning a business together in the future, get married, have kids, everything. We’ve talked about porn &amp; I tell him I’ve never watched porn but I do &amp; it’s lesbian porn. He’s usually not ever really in the mood so I turn to what helps me &amp; obviously I feel absolutely guilty after. I feel like I’m cheating on him because every month or so I slip up and watch it. I read online that women tend to watch lesbian porn because it’s more focused more on the female body &amp; not just another dude fuckin some girl. I don’t think I’m bi considering I could never see myself with a girl. Maybe if I weren’t in a relationship, in college experimenting, and it was just for fun I could maybe see something but that isnt the case &amp; this is someone I want to be with forever. I was wondering if anyone else has been through this. Breaking up would be a very tough situation for both of us considering he lives an hour away, we just settled in, and I couldn’t live without him. Do I tell him, do I break up with him, do I figure out how to stop &amp; never tell him?? 

I know I’m terrible. I need help.

Edit: he doesn’t watch porn. We live and work together. He has no time to. 

Also. I didn’t mention before, hes been diagnosed with OCD. Probably not the one you’re thinking. It’s more emotional meaning in his head he can’t be 100% sure about most things &amp; his mind will run in circles trying to justify and figure everything out but this could make his emotions spiral if I talk to him about it.",2019-07-07 14:28:40,18,1,relationship_advice
320,ca7dom,aerochan,Why does he want me now that I’m over him?,"So I dated one of my friends last year. I really liked him. I wanted to be with him. He ended up secretly choosing his ex over me and he doesn’t even tell me. She ended up texting me, saying that they’re back together and to stay away from him. I confront him about it and he tells me that he did nothing wrong and that it is what it is.

Three months after that, they break up and he apologizes to me (it was a bad apology). I’m still hurt and mad but above all, I ask him for my stuff back (to which he says, he doesn’t know where it is). A week later, he gets into a relationship with another girl.

Now we’re working together. He’s friends with my friends. I see him all the time because I have no choice. I’m triggered daily. I still have feelings for him but I feel stupid for it. I don’t talk to him, though. Two months after that, when I’m dating someone else (who is also not a good guy), he asks if we could talk. My guy at the time dumps me (but I’m okay with it. I detach easily and have ulterior motives when you do all the wrong things at the very beginning) and I tell old flame that we can talk. He sincerely apologizes this time, I tell him how he made me feel, we even joke like we used to and I tell him we might be friends again. Might. 

Three months after that, I decide that we can be friends again. I seal the deal by adding him on social media. We’re tagging each other in memes. He’s still in a relationship but I still have feelings for him and nobody knows. I don’t come onto him, however. I don’t cross the line. Two months after that, he turns on one of our best friends and I have enough. I instantly lose all feelings for him. I block him immediately. He messed up his second chance oh so quickly. 

Four months later of barely saying a word to each other and me barely acknowledging his existence, a mutual friend tells me that he said I’m the love of his life. 

Sb: before anyone asks “if you’re over him, why did you make this post?” I’m curious as to why people want to be with someone AFTER that person moves on...especially when they severed the relationship?

Update: two weeks after i stop being friends with him, him and his last girlfriend break up. Apparently, sometime after that, he tells our friend that he still likes me. Bad timing.",2019-07-07 14:27:17,2,1,relationship_advice
321,ca7cum,skargona,I'm (M23) in love with a close friend of mine (F24) who's also a co-worker,"I'm (M23) in love with a close friend of mine (F24) who's also a co-worker (I'm sort-of her boss), and we all share the same mutual friends (tight-nit friend circle). I know for a fact she likes me a lot as a friend, but don't know if she's in love in me. She does show signs when we're drunk, like touching me a lot, initiating conversations with me constantly, and so forth. When we're not drunk, she's just friendly but nothing more than that. She's fairly shy but nothing too over the top. She's way more experienced romantically and sexually than me, and she's a bit out of my league. I don't know if its my mind wanting her to be in love with me that's making me think she is, or if she's actually into me. But I've been having a crush on her for a long time now. Should I risk asking her out? Is she flirting or just being nice?

So either I ask her out, she says yes, we're both happy.

Or I ask her out, she says no, I'm afraid that things will be really awkward at work and the friend circle will see me differently.

Or I don't ask her out, I don't risk the amazing friendship we have.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks

tl;dr

In love with close friend, I'm not sure if she likes me back. Don't want to ruin friendship by asking her out and getting rejected.",2019-07-07 14:24:44,0,0,relationship_advice
322,ca7cja,imthedino,My girlfriend is mad at me. I think?,Okay so me and my girlfriend have a good bond. We’ve been friends for a long time and both love each other a lot. Last night our town had some fireworks and stuff and we were gonna go if it wasn’t to late. We found out it started at 11 which would to be late so I made plans with some of my friends to go play some board games and she said that was fine. I thought something was up and asked her and she insisted that it all was okay. So I went out with them and didn’t get home till about 12. She was asleep and I went to bed next to her. Well while I was out I didn’t see she messaged me saying that she was lonely watching the fireworks alone and lonely in bed (in the sad way not the sexual) then after that message she said she wasn’t mad at me and was just down and felt like she is the negative one. I don’t want her being upset with herself or mad at me. I don’t know what I should do. Any advice?,2019-07-07 14:23:50,3,1,relationship_advice
323,ca7bcs,Gloomy-Strawberry,My Ex's new gf messaged me asking for advice," The other day I got a Facebook message from a random girl saying that she has been dating my ex for a little while. 

For context I was dating him for 4 years and we were engaged but I left because he was emotionally abusive and manipulative and he nearly destroyed my life.
 
She wanted to know what happened between us because he has been acting suspicious and lying about small things. I told her vaguely that he did the same to me and that he is not a good person and it will get worse but left out a lot of the specifics because talking about it brings up bad memories and I also don't know her at all.

I can't stop thinking about it now though and I'm thinking I should contact her again and invite her for coffee and go into more detail and answer any other questions she has but I'm not sure if that would come across as weird. I also haven't spoken to or seen him since I left and have absolutely no intentions or desires to ever see or hear from the guy again and I'm worried I'm ensuring it by continuing. 

What would you do in my situation, I really don't want this girl to go through the same thing as me with the same guy and it seems he is doing all the same things to her that he did to me at the start. On the other hand I don't want to come across to her as the clingy or jealous ex.",2019-07-07 14:20:28,9,1,relationship_advice
324,ca5gzh,ladymariaisdead,My (26f) boyfriend (27m) has a womanizer friend who wants to get back with his ex but keeps on seeing other people.,"(throwaway account as my bf also uses reddit)

Me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 5 years. He has a friend (26m) who is some sort of a womanizer. I don't have much friends so I was included in their circle. They are nice guys in general and have been good friends for years.

His friend, let's call him A, had a previous serious girlfriend who became sort of my friend. Let's call her B. They're okayish but fight most of the time. They have been together for 2 years, I think, and then broke up. Couple of weeks later, they talk again and saying they wanted to try to get back together but should fix things first. So they started sort of dating again. But A says, there's no label yet as they wanted to fix their issues first before they can be official again. At this time, A has been seeing multiple women. He even introduced some of them to us. He says he is just dating them casually but the girls act as though they are already committed and stuff. B is getting a hint about this and she keeps on asking me about it. A wants me to tell her that there are no other girls. He tells us he really loves her, it's just that their relationship had been so toxic that he wants things fixed before they become together again, officially.

So now I'm stuck because I wanted to tell her the truth so that she can move on but doing that might ruin my boyfriend's friendship with A and possibly with his other friends.",2019-07-07 10:33:03,2,2,relationship_advice
325,ca2kg4,littlemisspringfield,My boyfriend regularly hangs out with a women that I know likes him. Am I justified in telling him this relationship makes me feel uncomfortable?,"My (32/f) boyfriend (40/m) hangs out with a woman he used to work with regularly. For reference, he has many female friends, the vast majority who I have zero problem with him spending time with. This woman, however, I can tell likes him. I’ve only hung out with them together on two occasions, but I definitely got the vibe she has a thing for him. To validate my POV, I told his best friend one night that I think this female friend likes my boyfriend. The best friend told me that he totally agrees and even told my boyfriend this woman likes him (boyfriend disagrees). Recently I confronted my bf with this and he said that was a long time ago (so he KNEW at one point she likes him), and that while he knew she was attracted to him initially, he made her aware he’s in a serious relationship and they’re now very good friends.
I can’t help but feel uncomfortable with him spending time with someone he knows “used to” have feelings for him and have voiced this opinion. Am I wrong?",2019-07-07 03:43:54,10,7,relationship_advice
326,ca79px,TheMassiveDooge30,How should I (23M) go about this situation?,"Quick summury - Friends for 5 years, we talked for about 7/8 months last year and things were intimate (no sex). Ended because she told me she needed space, and enjoyed her alone time (had school and work atm), but the window was still open for the future. I realized how pushy, and needy I was, and I believe I just pushed her away. 

Nonetheless, at the time I told her no texting or hanging out because I wanted to get over her. Not even a week later, I changed my mind about hanging out. We hang out almost every week and if we don't text for awhile (which I don't initiate anymore. Mostly cause i hate texting), she will send me something, we'll talk for a couple days, and go on. Everything is the same except we're just not intimate (or texting all day, everyday but we don't have time for that). Last year I would initiate a lot of things like inviting myself over at night, or insisting she'd come cuddle when we watched TV, but now I just don't know what's cool or not. Or how to even bring it up. 

I'm nervous yet calm when I'm around her. The fact that we've been friends for so long, share a mutual friend group and tried this out before, it really throws me off as well. I don't want to lose her, but I know it's a possibility. Also, I'm not just gonna ask her on a date because we were never like that (Never went on a date with her and she didn't care). I've thought of hitting up her friend or friends BF, but I don't think other people need to be involved.  Idk, I just need some guidance.

TL:DR - Longtime friends began talking/dating. Things didn't work out because she needed space, etc but the window is still open. Months later, nothing has changed except no intimacy. Now I'm stuck on what to do next.",2019-07-07 14:15:55,9,1,relationship_advice
327,ca791t,WantingLifeAdvice,Am I a bad guy? Why do I feel so Lost?,"Posting on Format so yada yada. Alright This is only my third post so bare with me. I’m just a young guy asking for advice from the wonderful people of reddit.

I’m 18M and I have feelings for a former coworker as close friend of mine named V(18F). I really care about her because she’s not perfect. She has imperfections and has her battles and I do everything I can to try to help her and have told her, I’ll move mountains for her. She knows I feel this way but we currently aren’t dating but part of me doesn’t want to give up. (And before anyone says anything along the lines of creeper or anything like that, we’re still friends and it’s a matter of “friend zone” I think.) I really do care for her. 

Shortly before I confessed my feelings to V, I was in a FWB with a girl we’ll refer to as L(19F). L and I were in a short relationship(if you can call it that) for a week but quickly became FWB. We never did anything in person but very much over SC and texting. I ended up breaking it off with her because I found out she had feelings for me and I wasn’t interested in pursuing a relationship with her. It crushed her and we blew up at each other recently and currently aren’t talking. 

Now outta nowhere or as I like to call, “Tinder,” my former ex and later FWB has started talking to me again. For the story we’re gonna call her J(19F). She and I would meet up and do the deed and everything else but she’s the one who ended it months ago. She is very religious and felt guilty and now all of a sudden we’re talking again and she wants to get together Thursday. 

So with all this being said, I’m feeling lost and I don’t know what to do. I do have strong feelings for V and I care so much about her. She and I have both come from shitty backgrounds and found each other about a year ago. Ever since she’s been in my life and we both want to keep it that way. Making her smile on her birthday was the pushing factor for my dumbass to realize I had feelings for her. I had for a long time but chose to ignore them. I don’t feel this way towards L or J at all. L was a close friend of mine but she could get very attached or emotional over smaller things. J and I would have our fun and it seemed to be good but that’s all relationship was. Just our fun and than gone. Wouldn’t talk unless wanted to hook up. And I was relieved when we stopped the first time because I started to feel wrong afterwards. 

Am I bad guy for all of this? I honestly don’t know if I am at this point. I’m feeling lost and just trying to figure this all out or seek some clarity. Thanks for reading all of this.",2019-07-07 14:14:06,3,1,relationship_advice
328,ca7865,animalcrackers2018,Should I [F30] tell my partner [M32] to care a little less?,"My partner(not a psychologist) and I have been married for four and a half years and he has recently diagnosed me with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) and he has spent a lot of time researching it and has also discovered that I 'split'. 


For reference: Splitting (also called black-and-white thinking or all-or-nothing thinking) is the failure in a person's thinking to bring together the dichotomy of both positive and negative qualities of the self and others into a cohesive, realistic whole. It is a common defense mechanism.


I appreciate his desire to understand me and try and fix me, but I hate the way he is doing it. I'm seeing a therapist who has yet to diagnose me. I do have a tendency to have the splitting mindset but it's mostly when I am around him. 

We've had a lot of problems in our marriage(I cheated)(I lied)(I want an open relationship he does not)(I'm probably walking away from my faith)(He is financially controlling)and I'm working on myself, and he's trying to work on me too. It's exhausting to see a therapist and then come home to someone who is looking at me like a specimen to be observed. 


We're about to go to marriage counseling and I'm nervous that the therapist won't get a good understanding of who I am because My husband wants to tell the therapist I have BPD and split so that I don't 'trick' the therapist. 


How do I tell him to back off without sounding rude? I want to tell him that maybe he should be spending his time examining himself, but I don't think that'd go over well. Or is what he is doing normal and I should be grateful to have someone who cares so much after all I've done?",2019-07-07 14:11:42,4,1,relationship_advice
329,ca5f68,oblom07,"Girl I've been seeing is playing the I love you one minute, fuck off the next game.","Been seeing this girl for a couple weeks now, things seem to be going pretty well on most fronts except this one. Everything will be fine and dandy one moment: we'll be chilling with each other, her in my arms, having the time of our lives. The next moment, she's completely fucked off and will go as far as completely dodging eye contact with me. Note that she doesn't do this with her friends; she'll talk to them like her normal, cheery self, pretending like nothing is happening. 

My head is breaking over this because I know I'm not being a douchebag or mistreating her. I can feel the whole mood shift when this happens, and it's been fucking with me to the point where I can't sleep well anymore wondering wtf I did, or what I can do to fix this. When I ask if she's ok, she'll say ""I'm fine"" and expects me not to question any further as that pissed her off (found out the hard way). All this said: what do I do here? I don't wanna leave her, but I also don't want this problem to persist. I'm an affectionate guy, and can't show it when she ghosts me like this. 

Example: she invited me to her family's cabin. This was my first time meeting them all, and surprisingly, they all seemed to like me a lot which she was very happy about. So her, me, and a couple more friends are out on the boat, drinking, I got her under my arm. I get up to talk to the rest of the group to be friendly, and upon my return, she wants literally nothing to do with me. I asked if she was ok, she said (you guessed it) ""I'm fine"", and immediately went on her phone to scroll through fb. To me, that means the person needs space, ok, whatever, I sit on the seat across from her. Her friend then sits next to her to strike up a convo, and she's instantly all about it. Literally acting 100% good, laughing, making jokes. I try to make a convo, and get short one worded replies, or just straight-up get ignored.

330,ca5ejq,doogsu,An old friend msgs me = breakup. Now newly single should I pursue relationship with old friend.,"So.. 
Me(27 m) broke up with my partner (23 f) recently.. she was lurking on my phone and found a message that a friend of mine from a long time ago sent to me, we will call her Stacey, Stacey and I hadn't spoken in at least 8 years than randomly out of nowhere three weeks back she messages me saying ""hey, dreamt of you the other night"" I'm like ""oh cool must be the universe telling you to say hello""  the end...
my partner sees this conversation and flips out saying I'm chatting up other woman, we break up.. 

since  I'm now a single fella I decide to continue a conversation with Stacey, turns out we have heaps in common and are really clicking...

My problem is Stacey will sometimes leave my messages on seen for days or until I prompt a conversation then it's all good and strong vibes and we have a great conversation.. why would she do that if we are connecting so well?

I like her and now single am curious to pursue something with stacey but I feel that Stacey might just be a really nice person and not interested in that way and if I say hey want to go out sometime our current friendship will change to a weird dynamic.. is it because I'm freshly separated I'm now fixating on someone else and seeing signs when there are none or is she actually wanting to pursue something as well and is just bad at replies.

The way the conversations veer leads me to think she would be interested in being more than friends but at the same time her not replying to my messages for days at a time makes me think otherwise?  Idk am confused, any suggestions on what I should do would be appreciated.",2019-07-07 10:22:44,1,2,relationship_advice

I don’t know if he asked me to be FWB because he remembers I didn’t like commitment and wants as much as he can get or if he actually just wants to stay casual like this.

332,ca22zi,anotherchanceneeded,Seen my ex after 12 years I want him back,"Tl;dr I ran into my ex after 12 years. He left me because of the life I was leading. I have completely changed. I finshed college have great career but no guy in my life. How do I convince him I have changed.

Okay the backstory. I (f35) was a wild child. My bf(m35) met right after hs. We eventually moved in together. Once I turned 21 and could legally drink I spiraled out of control. My bf was so patient. At first I would get drunk, come home get sick, be hung over the next day. He took care of me. I would usually go out with him once or twice a week. I had no control. Eventually he got tired of me drinking. Whenever we went out we went shopping or to dinner. Never included going to the bar. This was his way of keeping me sober. Oh yeah we argued about my drinking. He refused to go to a bar with me. So I went with my friends. I turned into that girl who would accept any challenge. I drank heavily. Most times had no idea how I got home, if I made it home. Of course there were plenty of drugs too. I don't know why he stayed as long as he did. 

Anyway it culminated to one night someone called him to come get me it was bad. I was completely out of my mind, drugs and booze. He came in (I was told later) I was laying on the bar, most of my clothes were off. Guys were drinking shots out of who knows where. My bf fights thru to the bar and tries to get me home. I start protesting, the crowd pushed him out of the way. He called the police. They showed up. The crowd was dispersed.  My bf left after the police came. He talked with whoever called him, they took me home. 

My bf came home cleaned out his clothes and took his game console left eveything else. He wrote a check out for his half of the rent, to the landlord ,we had a little over month on our lease, we were looking to move. He left and I never seen him again until the other day. He blocked me on phone. I had no idea where he moved to. His friends would not give him up.

I want to say that this turned my life around. But no it took about 2 more years. One holiday, I forget which, I found none of my friends wanted to go out and party. They all had moved on. They started families, went to school, got careers. I was alone. I had moved back in with my mom after he left. She told me I ruined the best chance for hapiness. She said he was the one and you ran him off. I remember collapsing on the floor crying, asking for help. Mom was ready. She told me later until I asked for help she would only provide the roof over my head. She never came to help me, never cleaned up my puke, never felt sorry for me. She entered me in a treatment center to get me clean. It took a while  with some relapses.

Eventually I reenrolled in college got a degree in Business Management. Been working now for 4 almost 5 years. I am doing great. Love my career. Moved out of moms house last year. I think I put the old me behind me.

Now to seeing ex. I was going into a store. As I hit the sidewalk he comes out. He walks by. I stopped and turned. I yelled out his name. He stopped, he's looking at this woman who for some reason knew his name. I walked up to him, seeing he had no clue. I said ""I'm ""my name"". He takes a hard look. I do not look like I did before. My hair is cut short, wearing a business suit, lost a few pounds( still need 7 more to go). He got a big grin. We hugged. We chatted a few seconds, I asked if he had time for coffee to catch up. He had to get to the bank before it closed. I asked about after. He was ok with that but not coffee. So I suggested ice cream, I remembered his weak spot. We met up about a half hour later. 

He told me what he has been up to, I filled him in with my side. I asked if he had ever got married, no dated some but no one long term. He says ""I see you got married"". I respond what me no. He asked about the wedding band I was wearing. I had completely forgot about the the band I wear. It is to keep guys from hitting on me to the point I can't get my sales pitch in. Many women in my field do this for this reason. I try to explain it but I could see he wasn't buying it. Our meet ended shortly after. We exchanged numbers. 

So now it is the weekend, I have not heard from him. So I texted Friday him saying how nice it was to see him. I asked if we could do lunch sometime. No answer. So texted him today, playing it off like he never received original. He responds back that he is tied up. Thats it. No maybe later. I know I hurt him bad, destroyed him, but want him to know I have changed. What can I do? I know that sounds selfish. He always loved my mother, his passed away when he was 12. Should I have her reach out to him? Am I not  to think of any possibilty of us getting together?",2019-07-07 02:49:20,21,10,relationship_advice
333,c9zier,modpodgemylife,My mom hates my chosen major,"I (18f) am ethnically Chinese. My mother grew up relatively middle class in China, came to America at 18, and is very, very, VERY ""traditional."" As in, she clearly favors my brothers (7, 12, and 14) because they're boys, and because they do everything she asks them to do. And also, I feel like most people with immigrant parents can attest, they don't like art majors. They especially don't like when their children are art majors.

My mom and I got along sometimes. Though she always hated the fact that I just sort of do what I feel is right and not what she wants me to do.  This came especially to light when I started applying for college when I didn't apply to any of the colleges she wanted me to apply to and applied only to colleges I felt like were good for me. And I applied under animation, because you know it's what I want to do. She had a hissy fit over this, demanded I apply to bio or something she wanted but I stood my ground.

I ended up getting into the school I wanted to go to and will be attending there in the fall for animation. This greatly upset my mom again, because she spent the whole three months between me submitting the application to my receiving of the acceptance letter, telling me I wouldn't be getting in. And in fact, she's embarassed that I'm going into animation and telling all of her friends that I want to be a doctor.
She's even more embarassed when I talk to her friends and tell them I'm going into animation, to which they give me a confused look at.

This all came to a head recently when we went on vacation together with all of her friends and their families. Where I spent the whole time begging my mom not to disrespect the locals (she didn't listen) and claimed I embarassed her in front of her friends. Then got even more mad and started yelling at my about how absolutely ungrateful I am that she's paying for my college (she's not) and how embarassed she is that I'm not like her friends kids who do whatever their moms say (they don't) and that I'm an animation major and how she hopes I don't make any money so when I come back to her she can slam the door in my face(?).

I'm not really sure what to do. I feel like I do owe my mom my life for raising me and giving me food and shelter, but she's really being beyond extra for this. She's now ignoring me and has been for almost two weeks since we got home. I mean I'm not going to change my major for her, but my relationship has been strained. What do I do?

Is there a way I could have handled this better?,"I was in a relationship of about two months with this guy, let's call him G. This week I told him I am frustrated with what we were having Ang yesterday he accepted to talk to me about it.
I told him it was weird to me that we are practically neighbours and I can count on my fingers the times we went out these months. A lot of the times we just cancelled things because he don't manage his time. A lot of times he texted me in the time we were supposed to meet to ask if we could go out later, most of the times because he just woke up or just ate and were too full to go out.

I told G this yesterday, and when he tried to give an excuse that his sleeping schedule is messed up I just asked if he does this in his job. If he call his boss asking to come two hours late because he just ate or he just woke up. Obviously no, because G wants this to work out and manage his time, and if he wanted things to work out with me he would manage his time better.

He was still calling me, texting me, looking at my Snapchat story, but just saying “we’re just friends”. Fine, cool. My issue stands that when we’ve broken up in the past, which is usually during episodes of mania, he always comes back within the day. This time has been the longest we have been broken up. I ended up going to the hospital yesterday for severe abdominal pain, where he left work and met me there. Only to tell me he wants to be friends again, not be in a relationship. I didn’t care at the moment because I was in pain. His sister and mother are thinking that he is going to come back, but do y’all think he is or is he really done this time?",2019-07-07 13:44:58,3,1,relationship_advice

341,ca58d8,Arncho,I dont wanna talk to my mom anymote but I fear if I do so she will take her own life.,"Im 16 my mother is 40 something. 

For the first 10 years of my life she was fine but then we lost alot and she turned to drinking. Long story short this led to me living with my father having no contact to her for a number of years. Recently she has been trying to make an effort to get back in my life.

When I heard she was a town over and wanted to see me I didnt know how to feel, I decided I'd see a movie with her and see how things went. Things were fine but kind of weird. I felt like I barely knew her. Like she was just some aunt who never had kids and was trying to hang out with her sisters kids. She kept wanting hugs but each time I couldnt help but feel weird/empty about it. 

But when I drove her ""home"" (Canada driving laws) I saw the place she was living in. It was the basement bedroom at someones house.

Driving away I cried thinking about how my mother a 40 something year old was living in a bedroom with 2 bins of her belongings. That was all she had. And maybe 1/5 of the stuff in those bins were pictures of me and our old life (she wanted to give me some)

My fucking computer costs more than everything she owns.

I dont know how to tell her that I dont want to talk anymore. Call me a horrible person but she hasnt been in my life in forever and I just dont know her anymore. Every moment of the visit i had with her l felt out of place, like going to the arcade with your parents friend or some shit.

She keeps calling me asking if i want to go to the zoo or if I want to just hang out and go for a walk with her. Everytime I make up an excuse and her last texts I havmt even answered. I feel horrible about it but I just cant deal with her right now.

I dont want her to kill herself. But I dont want to talk to her. 

She lashed out at my dad over text about how lottle she has claiming she stole everything from her.

She admitted the day after she was drinking. She said she was gonna do rehab but on a tuesday night she lashed out over text again. 

She definetly didnt go to rehab. They dont let you contact people on weekdays.

I have no idea what to do. I wish she never contacted me in the first place. I had nearly forgotten about her and now i think about her sleeping along in her ill kept room. 

Please I dont know what to tell her.",2019-07-07 09:57:27,1,2,relationship_advice
342,ca9cfp,ZZzzabc123,Parents stopped paying for my college and stopped supporting me entirely because of 3 failed college classes.,"I started attending University in August of 2015. I am the 3rd in a family of 4 children and the 3rd to attend college. My oldest sibling finished in 4 years, my second didnt finish. After my dad realizes that I failed 3 college classes, in December of 2017, he forces me to move back in with them as I am, as he puts it, “not ready for college.” I talked to my advisor at my school and she says that I was still on track to graduate. He informs me that he wishes I get a job and an apartment to see what “real” life is like so as to go back to college more ready.

So I got a job back home that I actually really enjoyed and was living with my parents from January 2017 to April 2018 when I just had enough of living with them so I took all my stuff and through it into a storage unit and slept in my car or cheap air bnb’s for a couple of weeks until I got an apartment. 

This apartment was an actual nightmare. The job I had wasn’t minimum wage but not much more. The following year I basically just worked all the time. No time or money for friends or even myself. I had to pawn a lot of my dear possessions just to pay goddamn rent (some of which I couldnt afford to buy back). I had to get a credit card out so that I wouldnt go hungry and now I am in debt from that.

At this point I havent talked to any of my family. They keep telling me that they want to help but its their fault that I am this poor.

343,ca57mv,ManonBlackbeak,Can I [19F] help my best friend [19F] see (and possibly fix) her kinda obsessive behavior towards her boyfriend [20M]?,"**TL;DR: My best friend is showing some obsessive tendencies: she's getting jealous over every girl, she wants to spend way too much time with her boyfriend and they often separate themselves when they're hanging out with other people. She denies this, refuses to see her behavior is not normal and will get mad at me if I try telling her otherwise. I need advice on how to deal with this, because our other friends are starting to turn on her.** 

I have known my best friend Dana for 8 years. I also have this group of high school friends, we'll call them ""the boys"". In 2017 I invited Dana to the NYE party we were throwing and there she met her current boyfriend Steve. Me and my boyfriend at the time acted as wingmen and without us they most likely would have never started dating. We did it because we saw the chemistry and we thought it would be fun to go on double dates. Boy were we wrong. 

Everything worked out. They have been together for 1.5 years now. But I had never really seen Dana in a relationship before (she had one boyfriend before Steve, but they dated for a month). I didn't know what to expect, but it certainly wasn't this.

Obviously she wanted to be with Steve all the time. Initially I wrote it off as the honeymoon phase and thought they would chill out eventually. We were a big friend group and when we all went out together Dana and Steve would kinda separate themselves and chat or cuddle in the corner. When he talked to the others, after like 5 mins she would just try to take his attention back to her. Over the time the other people in the friend group started noticing this behavior and making jokes about it. I defended her, because I knew they had little time together (they attended different schools and had different school shifts, also this was senior year and they were going to universities in different countries afterwards). So it made sense to me that she would want to spend a lot of time with him. But I thought once summer break rolled around and they're able to see each other more frequently, they'll stop acting like this when they go out with the group. They didn't. And I stopped defending her. They hanged out alone fairly often and still when they went out with everybody they would separate themselves. I talked to Dana about this and her new excuse was that he'll be leaving for uni in August and they don't have enough time together. She also told me that when they hang out with other people she doesn't count it as quality time spent together. Which was utter bullshit because they were barely hanging out with the others, but ok. 

Aside from that, there were some other issues that I noticed. When Steve hanged out with the boys without her, she would sometimes get mad because ""he was paying them more attention than he was paying her"" and ""they had limited time together and this is how he chose to spend it"". I'll admit there were cases where he was acting stupid (like finally his parents aren't home, which was rare af, and he'd invite the boys for a sleepover, not Dana), but still he was paying her attention and going out with her just as much as he did with the boys. 

All of us went on 2 trips together during the summer and 24/7 Dana and Steve were glued to each other and yet again separated themselves from the rest. 

She would also get unreasonably mad at the very existence of his ex girlfriend (whom he's not in contact with and has said that she's horrible). She would trash talk the girl he used to have a crush on. She would get lowkey pissed at any girl in his orbit really.

They both left for uni and a month in Dana interrupted her studies, because this was not the right bachelor for her and she was stressed af. She then applied for Steve's university which coincidentally had the bachelor she had wanted all along (this is not a joke, she did say she wanted to study this before she even met Steve, but again I think if she wasn't in a LDR with him, she could have made it in the first uni). She lived with him there for 2 months, but had to come back, because she didn't get accepted. She'll try again and go back soon tho. 

She wanted to stay there and work, but they couldn't find an apartment for both of them, which was why she came back. Later he found a house and he's currently living with 2 boys and one girl. This girl has been friends with Steve for a few months now, Dana has met her and also she has a boyfriend. Nevertheless Dana is mad at the fact that Steve will be living with another girl and will be spending more time with her. Even though his situation is purely circumstantial. I tried telling her that she's getting mad for no reason, but she just won't listen to me. She said that once she goes back there she'll find a house with boys to get back at him. I told her she's being petty, she denied. 

We've gotten to the point where the boys joke about her relationship with Steve too often. Some of them have even expressed serious concern and told me they think she's obsessive. I don't defend her and I don't disagree, because I also see these tendencies. But every time I try to talk to her she gets super defensive and will pull up a hundred excuses about why she's right. She has no idea how other people see the situation, and if she does, she'll just start hating on them (as she did with my ex who has been very vocal about his opinion on her relationship). And she'll say they could never understand her situation. 

It's not pleasant for me to see everyone turning on her because she is my best friend. But I also can't really support her in this because I agree with the others. I want to find a way to tell her that she's being lowkey obsessive without her denying or getting mad at me, but it seems impossible. Am I even in the right here? Is she really that obsessive or is this normal behavior? Any advice on how can I talk to her without looking like I'm attacking her?",2019-07-07 09:53:52,1,2,relationship_advice
344,ca6x27,Thr0wawai18532688,My relationship with my friend,"So, I’ve been friends with this guy since school, we are 26 years old both of us. It all started with him being bullied and we took him in our friends group. So our group was maybe 10-15 people. We all hanged out and we all had our “roles”. It was a fantastic time, I miss it very much but as you know life grows on you. Everybody gets more responsibility in life, and before I knew it literally EVERYBODY moved away. So it’s basically me and him left from that group. 

Now, some backstory first about me and him. I wasn’t the very best friend for him, I could make fun of him and be very harsch against him. Now I was maybe 13-14 at the time and as I grew I understood that my behavior is not acceptable so I stopped being that kind of person to him. I don’t know why, and I’m not proud of it but I really tried to make up for it. But years could go and he would bring some shit I did to him in the past and claim I still do it, he was and probably still not over it. 

Since they all moved away and he being socially awkward he has only me left. And me, also being socially awkward but have other friends I hang out with. And a girlfriend which I spend most of my days with. So obviously he wants to hang out, and we do sometimes but we don’t have much in common so it’s not really giving me something? If you know what I mean. I feel guilty for letting him down. Feel like I own him my company because of who I was ten years ago. He post on his Instagram that his life is hard and so on. I feel horrible about it but when he asks to hang out I feel it’s like a burden. A chore I have to do. Don’t k ow what to do about it.",2019-07-07 13:38:48,0,1,relationship_advice
345,ca6wd5,jd992,"Issues designating chores and keeping the house clean, advice?","So this advice isn’t really for me, it’s for my brother and his fiancé. They moved in together about a year ago and everything about their relationship is great but they are two completely different people as far as energy level and cleanliness.

My brother likes everything to be neat and clean and dishes done, he can’t chill for the day in a messy house.

While his fiancé is pretty messy, she has a lot of clothes and art stuff and tends to scatter things around and doesn’t really “clean” well at all.

I’m the maid of honor in their wedding, and they’ve both expressed their concern to me about their differences in cleaning styles but nothing I’ve came up with has helped so far.

My brother takes care of everything outside the house (cutting the grass, spraying for weeds, home repairs etc.) And also has expressed that he’s tired of doing everything in the house too (dishes, kitchen, laundry, cleaning the floors). 

Their work schedules are different, my brother works 12 hour days Monday-Friday and she works 8 hour days 3 days a week then works from home 2 days a week.

I stayed for a week at their house helping with their new puppy and that’s exactly how it goes. His fiancé will “attempt” to clean by vacuuming one room or running one load of laundry, then just chill and watch shows and play on her phone while the rest of the house is a mess. 

I’ve tried to give some advice (make a schedule, designate certain rooms, etc) but even after asking for my advice and talking to her himself, his fiancé simply refuses to clean unless it’s during an argument when my brother has worked a 12 or 14 hour day and comes home and everything is still a mess. 

I’m not sticking my nose where it doesn’t belong, as my brother has asked for help. What is some advice I can give to both of them? It’s causing some resentment in their relationship and I really would like to help clear this issue up prior to their wedding!",2019-07-07 13:36:44,1,1,relationship_advice
346,ca6viz,Zasker55,Unsure if my [27m] relationship is working with my [23f] partner,"I've been seeing my girlfriend for about 5 months now and everything has been going well, we even recently went on holiday together and I saw a future together. However, over the past week, she seems to have become very distant with me and seems to be arguing with me over very small petty things which have got me questioning whether it is actually working. 

&amp;#x200B;

I usually just let the arguments slide as in my opinion it's not worth turning them into a big thing but they are getting more and more frequent and she is seemingly becoming more distant with me.  The latter is weird as usually, she would tell me what's wrong but as of late I can tell somethings wrong but I am really needing to question her to find out what's wrong or she will tell me more by message than in person, which is a bit weird in my opinion.  


So all in all, I have a feeling that this is starting to stop working but I'm not 100% as it's a bit of a weird situation so if anyone can weigh in and give me some advice it would be much appreciated.",2019-07-07 13:34:10,2,1,relationship_advice
347,ca6ven,throwitoutagain4u8,"Suspect my (33m) boyfriend is cheating. I (29f) looked trough his phone and the only dots I can connect seem to prove that, but I cannot be sure","My boyfriend and I have been dating around 6 months. In that time we have gotten very close, very quickly. We also became monogamous fairly early after seeing each other, at his request.  Things are really great between us, we both open up to each other very candidly and can talk to each other about anything.


Things have seems strange / off with our sex life, leaving me to believe there may be something going on. He has mentioned a close friend that is a girl, who happens to live in his same apartment complex. I haven’t asked too much about her, as I haven’t wanted to seem untrusting or envious of their friendship. He has always called her his “friend” though I haven’t always assumed they had a romantic.


I have done something I deeply regret, in a sad attempt to find more. I looked through his phone(at length) and found things I do not like. (He told me his phone password early on as well).


Things I saw that I wish I hadn’t:

-messaging between the two of them right before we became exclusive on WhatsApp. They called each other babe/baby and she said “wanna see some tits before I fall asleep?”

-their text message history had very recently been cleared (only 3 texts were there between the two of them, which seemed strange to me)

-a screenshot that he took of one of their older text messages which he said multiple times he couldn’t fall asleep, and that he needed “the mouth”, to which she asked if he could sleep without 

-a tinder verification code that was sent to his phone about a month ago (though no tinder app) - we deleted our tinder accounts (not apps) 
together when we became exclusive, so he had to create a new account and has apparently since deleted. 

-multiple suggestive exchanges between the two of them on what’s app - them hanging out many times (to which I didn’t know he was doing, not suggesting he needs to tell me every second of every day who he is with...but he is usually very open with that, so seems odd to withhold) conversions like “I rode my bike today and my taint is really sore.” With a response of “well let me know if you wanna come over later and try that taint out again” 


I wish more than anything I hadn’t looked through his phone, but unfortunately what is done is done and now I feel fairly sure that he is or has been cheating on me. 

I would like some advice on how to move forward. I obviously need to talk to him, but how can I do so in way that doesn’t make him feel the need to lie or be defensive? What makes matters worse is that we are on vacation visiting my family (his first time meeting them) and we leave in a couple days. I feel I shouldn’t bring it up now, given the circumstances, but it’s eating me up.

Given what I’ve found and he has told/not told me...am I assuming too much by deciding he is very likely cheating on me?",2019-07-07 13:33:46,9,0,relationship_advice
348,ca6urw,marijuangel,Am I (19F) blowing this situation with my boyfriend (25M) out of proportion?,"I know the answer to this is “just talk to him.” I’m figuring out how to bring it up, I just want to know if I’m acting psychotic or if this is actually weird. 

Basically my boyfriend has a friend who lives out of town hours away, my boyfriend has went on a trip to go see her before and reassured me she was just a friend, but I always found it weird since he is so broke. He can’t afford to take me on a proper date even though I’ve taken him and paid for trips but he was able to pay half his gas for a trip to go see her (she paid the other half.) He said she was going through a rough time though and she needed a friend, so whatever, I get it. 

I haven’t really brought up my insecurities about her since the trip, but he is seriously always texting her. Like it’s always paragraphs or 3-4 texts at once, and he doesn’t text me like that and it doesn’t feel like he bothers to reply as timely with me but as soon as his phone lights up when he’s with me he’ll reply to her. I understand they don’t see each other and I see him every day, but still, HOW DO YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO SAY TO EACH OTHER?

And just a few other things, like DAMN comments on her pictures and such. (He rarely comments on any of my shit much less profile pictures, much less compliments usually it’s something funny) but he says he’s known her for years and it’s like his little sister. I feel like I’m being played and I get in a bad mood every time his phone dings because I don’t believe him. Guys, do you have platonic friends that are girls that you talk to all day every day and you really don’t have feelings for them? Am I overreacting?

349,ca6und,korbey87,"Issues with long term relationship, seeking advice on whether or not to continue","Very long post sorry I just don’t have anyone else to talk to.

I (f25) have been with my partner (m27) since I was 17. We broke up for a year and a half and rekindled our relationship about 1.5 years ago. The decision to end things was mutual, we just needed some time apart &amp; I was struggling with the fact that he seriously lacked motivation &amp; goal setting. This improved during our time apart &amp; we were ready to start fresh and begin our life together.

Things were going great &amp; we moved in together July last year. Ever since then his motivation has just spiralled down. He says he is going to do something and it just never gets done, or he starts something and never finishes it. I am not just referring to household things (such as completing our cat run which was supposed to be done last November... or cleaning out two of the bedrooms which are now filthy full of all his junk), but also putting effort into our relationship and empathising with my feelings. I’m not a needy girl ... I am very independent and I am capable of holding my own.. but when I’m in a relationship I do expect some kind of effort? I try so hard to help him whenever I can or to support his decisions and goals but I just get nothing back from him.

I’m obviously biased but there have been a few significant incidents within the last couple of months that really have me questioning the relationship and I would just like some outsider opinions.

Around about January I found out he was financially supporting his Mother. This was going on for months and I had no idea. This is while we were supposed to be saving for a house deposit and I was putting more in than he was. He was sending her $300 a month! I didn’t care about the money, it was more that he lied to me about the whole thing. We discussed this and he seemed to understand how much this upset me. We agreed to discuss any financial decisions like this with each other in future (because .. duh!!).

In April we started arguing a lot over everything, him not going to work, me doing everything around the house, him smoking weed all the time, broken promises. All he while knowing our lease renewal was due in July. We discussed the lease, unsure if we are going to renew as I was not happy. He promised me he is going to change and work on “himself” and things will be better by July. We had a holiday booked so we wanted to put all that aside and enjoy it, which we did.

Since then we were at dinner with my partner &amp; his siblings and I overheard him &amp; his mother discussing something. All I heard was him saying “yeah of course we will Mum, I would expect that”. I asked him what this was about when we got home &amp; he told me his mum said we are going to have to pay her lawyer fees if/when she drops dead (she’s ill and going through a nasty divorce). This is $10,000!! I don’t believe this is fair &amp; he has just agreed to this without discussing it with me? We agreed to disagree on the topic for the time being and moved on.

About a month ago I got my wisdom teeth removed on a Friday. We had a rent inspection on the next Tuesday. We knew about this inspection &amp; I began preparing the house about a week prior to my surgery. We usually just split the chores and work on them in our own time. I noticed he wasn’t getting started on his but whatever, I figured he would be home all weekend looking after me anyways and he would have the time to do them then. My surgery was intense, I had 3 wisdom teeth out (2 of them were impacted) and I’m only a small girl so the drugs and the anaesthetic really f*cked with me. My mum took me to and from the hospital (my partner couldn’t take work off as he took 2 days off work the week prior because he didn’t wake up to his alarm and had to fake sick ...) I got home and mum looked after me. 

When he got home my mum left &amp; he sat on the couch &amp; didn’t help me at all. Hours after surgery and I was still getting nothing from him .. Sunday rolls around and I’m expecting him to at least start doing the household stuff. He had work on Monday so this was the last day to do it. 2pm and still nothing. I ended up asking him when he’s going to make a start but I get nothing. I start to do his chores for him. I’m literally on my hands and knees clearing out the garden beds, 2 days after surgery, while my boyfriend lays on the couch watching me. He did not help at all but I was home when the house got inspected and explained to the property manager the situation. She was understanding, it was all good..

Things were not good between us after that, not to mention the fact my mouth didn’t heal properly and I was on hectic drugs for the following 2 weeks. We discussed this and I asked him why he acted that way and he said “because I was angry because you should have been in bed”. I don’t think that is an excuse nor do I think he has a right to blame me for his actions. I was pissed off and I still am pissed off tbh. The next surgery I will probably ever need is when I have a baby and if that’s the way he acts then I would rather do it on my own.

Next thing our lease renewal is due. We had a sit down and I explained that nothing has changed and I’m not sure if I want to renew it with him. I love him so much, he is the man I expect to marry &amp; to have children to, but I dont think I can live my life this way. He could see how upset I was and we revisited it a week or so later (this was about two weeks ago now). He came up with an action plan and a list of all of these things he is going to do eg stop smoking weed, wake up earlier to get shit done before work, date night once a week, budget, finish the bloody cat run etc. I suggested maybe we could go to couples counselling or we could go separately but he is against that idea. I though.. Finally! This seems like a positive step! He was so convincing in that he wants to make an improvement and set some goals. 

So that was two weeks ago and nothing has changed. I have asked him about his action plan and he just says he is “working on it”. He went out last night with our friends (I stayed home) and told me he was going to be home at 10. I freaked out as it was 12 and he wasn’t home so I was worried &amp; messaged our friends. He passed out on the couch because he smoked too much weed? But he was going to drive home?? He has already been done Driving Under the Influence before and he was going to risk it again, which he constantly does, and I f*cking hate it for obvious reasons .. I thought alright well at least he didn’t drive and he is safe. I was woken up at 2:30am to him walking through the door!!! He came into our room and I just said hi but then he passed out on the couch and we have been home all day but not spoken since. He didn’t get off the couch until 2pm ... He also went to a friends house on Friday night (I stayed home). Both of these nights were not important nights for our friends (no birthdays etc) and could have been nice time to spend together.

Honestly I’m sorry this is so fkn long but I needed a rant. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this &amp; I don’t know what to do? We still haven’t signed our lease. I’m stupid but I do love this man (boy) ... All this shit keeps on piling up and it’s been at least 6 months of negativeness and broken promises.

It’s not easy or cheap to find a rental on my own. I’ve done it before so I can do it. I just know if we break up again this will be the last time and that makes me so upset. I’m really just disappointed he doesn’t seem to care about this relationship as much as I do.",2019-07-07 13:31:32,9,1,relationship_advice

I can handle rejection and at least on my part it wouldn’t affect our (limited) working relationship, but don’t want to miss out on an opportunity.",2019-07-07 13:29:46,3,1,relationship_advice
351,ca6tu8,thomie134,I (18M) would love advice on having more civil arguments and being less defensive with SO (18F),"I’m curious what your guys advice is for having more peaceful arguments with your SO? We both struggle to prevent becoming defensive during arguments and although the topics aren’t serious, the arguments can be emotionally draining for both of us.

In the heat of the moment it’s almost like we end up forgetting we’re on the same team and don’t take each other’s emotions in mind. We both love each other very much and would love to find an effective strategy of having more civil arguments. I know we’re both young, but rather learn now than never!

Any tips would be greatly appreciated! Thanks reddit &lt;3",2019-07-07 13:29:09,4,1,relationship_advice
352,ca6tkh,bananaranaa,I think i peed myself in my boyfriends bed,"
edit: i wrote this post at 5AM and it wouldn’t post til now, i’m not drunk anymore so any reference to me driving to work- i’m sober 

hi, i’m on mobile and maybe a bit drunk, so sorry if the format is bad. 

I have a really great relationship, it was one of those things where you meet someone and feel like you’ve known them forever. we’ve been together for a year and talking for almost two years. 

tonight, we went out and i had a few drinks (2 beers and 2 shots of tequila) and he drove me back to his house where i’ve spent the night. 

i peed before we left and when we got back and we had sex twice, and neither time did i feel concerned that i had to go to the bathroom. (i have a good bladder, normally.) 

anyway, i woke up around 5am to him angrily grabbing shit and leaving the room, and once i actually woke up and got a grasp on reality, i realized i was in a HUGE puddle.  (and honestly, the puddle seems way too big for it to be my pee; i don’t pee that much.) 

Upon investigation, i can’t determine if the sheets smell like pee or not. If it’s not pee, i don’t know what it is. 

anyway, he’s obviously mad as i don’t know what to do, he has to take me back to my car and i really don’t even want him to. i’m thinking of just getting an uber and going that way. i’m so fucking embarrassed. 

i can’t remember the last time i peed myself, even while drunk, and i don’t understand how it even happened. i’ve drank way more than that without that ever happening to me. i’m scared he’s mad and i’m extremely embarrassed. i don’t even want to see him. 

i took off the blankets and sheets and luckily whatever liquid it was didn’t soak through to his mattress, so in theory, once the sheets are cleaned it’ll be over with, but what the fuck do i do!? how bad is this? i want do die i’m so embarrassed",2019-07-07 13:28:13,22,1,relationship_advice
353,c9xr8g,WhyItEvenMatter,I wonder if I'm unfit for any kind of relationship,"I'm a 22 y.o. female, coming from a loving-but-dysfuncional family. They meant well, still do, but their problems were more visible than good parts, and I haven't really learned many things about human contact. 

When I was younger I have learned to hug because of my friend, I also realised that you can argue in a healthy way observing her family. The brand of love in my home was more ""guilt inducing"" or ""pushy"". My mom is a great person, but one that was raised and expected to do everything. She cleans, cooks, takes care for everything and everyone, and one who never teached me how to say no, or do things I want to, or take care of myself. My dad tried, but he is really inconsiderate when it comes to others, easily angered, and I mostly avoided him growing up. My grandparents are similiar. My siblings are either clueles about relationships, living pretty isolated and not wanting contact, or really social, loud, with kids, connecting to the people on the spot, and pretty condescending towards me. We don't know how to talk with each other.

And I don't connect with people, not on purpose, but... I've never learned how to. I was scared, depressed kid that followed any person who agred to hang with me, being friends with these people untill they found new ones.

As I got older then I tried to better myself, I took care of my anxiety and depresion, I found hobbies I like, went to college, found some clubs... and I still feel like I just watch other people interact. 

I don't know how to get friends, I always initiate the contact and hang with people, but I don't know how to make it personal. 

I've never been asked on a date. I've never asked anyone. I don't know if I wan't that. I'm not asexual, nor aromantic, I'm just both scared about my ability to handle relationship and clueles about signs from other people. 

I'm good with kids, I can take care of them and play with them, but I can't imagine myself as a mother.

And now I'm wondering more and more if I'm devoid of something other people have at this point, ability to conect, to bond, love or trust, if there is something wrong with me. 

I came here to ask for advice on if there is anything I can do to fix it.",2019-07-06 19:45:39,20,26,relationship_advice

356,ca547c,trowawayyy54321,Am I [23M] overreacting over my GF[22F] going out and drinking too much,"So me and my GF have been in a relationship for 5 years. Last year we broke up because we fought a lot, mainly because of what we do when we get drunk. We stayed in touch in that time, but for the sole purpose of being friends. We were on a break for 3 months and eventually we got back together. Both of us hooked up with other people in that time, we both knew that and we agreed that we don't mind that. 

Little more back story here: my gf has a female friend who is known to being a ""slut"", who will I call ""Anna"", flirting with other men although she has a boyfriend, talking with random people to get them to pay for her drinks, enjoying mens company and all the attraction that she gets. My gf and Anna are inseparable since childhood, they always go out together. At first I was going out with them but once when I saw how that friend acts I told my GF that I am not really happy about the way that friend acts, especially when she gets drunk. My GF and Anna used to get drunk almost every weekend so we got into fights occasionally hence the breakup.

In that meantime when we weren't together, my gf hooked up with some guy that is a friend of Anna and her boyfriend.

So after that breakup, we agreed that we won't get drunk at all, we will communicate more and everything was awesome until few months ago, when my GF and Anna started going out on weekends. I know that both of them got drunk, Anna's BF used to go out with them and be their driver. I didn't want to go out because: 1) I like being headache free on Sundays, or 2) I was working night shift on friday,  or 3) working on saturday and sunday.
So they have been going out at least 2 times a month, and sometimes even that friend that my gf hooked up with happened to be in the same place as they, at their table and buying them drinks.

Am I overreacting if I tell my GF that I want her to stop getting fucking drunk with that slut Anna? I have nothing against the two of them going for a coffee or a drink, but not drinking until 4am in the morning every friday/saturday.",2019-07-07 09:39:06,3,2,relationship_advice
357,ca544p,thelonelylime,What am I supposed to do or feel?,"So I’m a freshly 20f, and my unofficial boyfriend (almost 18) talks to his ex (15f) every day . The girl he left for me. Idk what they talk about because it’s on snap, but he claims they don’t ever really talk about much; just sending pictures back and forth. 

He claims to understand why it bothers me that he talks to her everyday, but doesn’t do anything to change it. I’ve never once asked him to delete or stop talking to her, but I just feel that they don’t need to be talking every single fucking day. They don’t have to be bitter or cut each other out completely, but why should she be second or first to me on snap chat? Why is the person he talks to the most other than me his damn ex? I can’t wrap my mind around it.

She has sent him pictures in her bikini and sports bra as well, but he talked to her about it and told her it needed to stop if she still wanted to stay friends on snap. But anyways, so I know she’s not over him. She also still has pictures of them up on her insta. 

With that being said. My boyfriend has been lying to me a lot recently. The other day we had plans to hang and told me he didn’t feel well and canceled; said he was gonna go home and spend time with his family for his sisters birthday. But he went out for a day of fun instead and stayed at a friends. It didn’t bother me that he went out and did things. Just that he ditched me and lied. Instead of telling the truth and/or inviting me. He apologized. Said he just needed some personal time but didn’t wanna hurt my feelings. 

Next day he asks me to chill and I say no because I’m not gonna be an option that someone can just come and go from as they please. So we didn’t get to spend the 4th together. Friday comes and I’m all ready to hangout finally, I ask him if he wants to do anything tonight and he says “nah I’m just gonna chill at home. I was gonna invite you to a party with me but I’m not invited anymore.” Hes at a friends while saying this. Said he was gonna get a ride home. I say, no you’re going to the party and he says he’s not. Then his location pops up at the same location my friend was at, and she was at the party he said he wasn’t going to. When I confront him, still he denies it. When I brought up the location he was like okay I’m here but I didn’t even party. Like???? Going to a party and partying are the same thing. He also said he was staying sober to DD. Next day he tells me he had 1 beer. Then a friend tells me he drank half a bottle of captain and at least 2 beers. He said he was gonna get dropped off at home after, but stays with a friend again. 

Next morning I get a message from a friend saying “are you and ____still together? He was all over his ex all night.” The ex that he snap chats every day. Mind you, he never told me she was even there, let alone that he was socializing with her to such an extent that people were noticing. My crazy ass gets up and drives 45 minutes to where my boyfriend is at 9am, I show him that message and we’ve been arguing all god damn day. He denies everything that my friend told me he did. Up and down. I gave him plenty of chances to tell me the truth and explained how I don’t wanna be with someone like that, but he doesn’t fess up to anything. He just says that he wasn’t all over her, and that they were just talking, and he gave her a hug when he saw her. None of which I’m okay with honestly. Who needs that close of a “friendship” with their ex? Who???but anyways, yeah I don’t know what to believe. I’m getting polar opposite stories. I wanna believe my man but why would my friend make all this shit up? I mean I just met her so I don’t know her true colors, but I can’t imagine she would say these things for fun. But I also don’t want to think my bf would do me like that. It’s all so confusing, because now he’s mad at me for “accusing” him, when I was just telling him what I heard and trying to get to the bottom of it. 

Today, after I showed up to his location, the lying only continues. After our talk/argument, he insists I go home and that he needs additional space even though we hadn’t seen each other in 5 days. So I get punished for bringing something to his attention and getting pissed about it. I sat in my car a block from where he was for hours trying to find something to do when I could’ve just been hanging out with him. I find a party and he decides to come too. I went and hung out with a friend and we met up at the bon Fire. Whole night he was just aloof and in a bad mood, not showing any affection. We start talking and I ask if he had been with his ex all day, because I was getting suspicious. And he was. but he says “I wasn’t hanging with her, she was just there with us” 🤣And he also rode with her and some others there and didn’t fucking tell me. Lie. Lie. And lie. The way him and his ex would interact made me vomit in my mouth. Every time she talked to him, she had to reach her arm out and touch him lightly. I kept getting this competition vibe from his ex and another girl all night. Even though I was the one obviously there with him. 

We end up going to the car to talk and it doesn’t go well. He says he’s not happy and blah blah blah because I brought some things up during the party that bothered me.  Heaven forbid. He always turns the conversation so negatively and it usually ends with him bashing me basically, calling me out for all the things he doesn’t like. He told me basically that things won’t change and if I don’t like him and Maddis friendship then I should leave. Because I guess their friendship is more meaningful than what we have. Even though he told me he was only with her to use her as an emotional support buddy basically. 

I wanted to stay the night with him but he needs more fucking space. I threw a fit! I haven’t gotten to sleep with him in almost a week. He refused!! Like absolutely refused. And on top of that, it’s my damn birthday. He said he had the house to himself earlier and was gonna go home and chill after the party. Lie. He’s at a friends. I’m sure his ex is staying there again. 

And I’m supposed to trust this kid? He gets so mad that I don’t after he’s been lying to me for a week straight. Totally logical. 

So tell me, who else doesn’t agree with their s/o talking to and confiding in their ex constantly? 

What do you make of this situation? What should I do? I would just leave but I’m attached to him and think we can work through this..he just has some issues he’s dealing with internally and so externally, he’s not handling it well.

Why does someone just lie and lie and lie? I can’t understand

EDIT) I might also add that he holds it over my head that I didn’t tell him when a couple guys asked me for nudes. Even though I didn’t send any. Buttttt he can go behind my back like this and it’s fine?",2019-07-07 09:38:50,7,2,relationship_advice
358,c9s52s,TheSVP,I (25M) don't know what to do. Fiancé(26F) unhappy with me and thinks all I want to do is play video games. She's wrong.,"Hi all,

This is a post you probably see alot. I've been my with fiancé for 3 years now and lived together almost 2 years.

I've always been an avid gamer and she's enjoyed playing some games  but I've always enjoyed MMOs which tend to take up more time than other games.

I admit that sometimes I can take the cake and play for quite a while. Sometimes 4 to 8 hours a night. 

We had a similar issue when another game came out and I played quite alot. A similar issue has arisen now with the release of a new game and I'm currently playing far more than I usually do.

Now, my fiancé know this and understands this but it's upsetting her.

However, because I've been playing far more, she believes that the free time I spend with her is forced and all I want to do is play games. Totally wrong.

I work 5 days a week, cook, clean occasionally and she does the same. She doesn't have many hobbies and goes out maybe once a week.

When I play, she knits and watches Netflix. I sometimes stop and go and see how she is doing but I can tell its awkward.

This week, I have played quite alot and perhaps that's the problem. But it's not like we haven't spent time together. Tonight we're going out to celebrate for a birthday party.

We constantly have this issue about me playing video games. Always. And we can't seem to overcome it.

I've offered asking her to play with me and she doesn't want to. I've offered to schedule my gaming but she believes we shouldn't do that. I've even offered to throw the PC out the window if that would make her happy.

Over to you Reddit. This is a hurdle we can't see to beat and I fear it might be something that we will never beat.

Any additional questions, I don't mind asking. Thanks.",2019-07-06 10:26:14,205,143,relationship_advice
359,ca6qxa,ComfortableCookie4,I (25M) am unsure how to interact with my co-worker (22F),"I've known her for around 6 months and we have been very friendly but I've been strictly professional. She does not have a car, so she'd usually go with me at client meetings.

Recently I asked her if she'd like to go have dinner with me. She reacted by not talking to me for two weeks, avoid eye contact and make it extremly unconfortable. I apologised to her as I didn't mean any offense. She just ignored it.

Fast forward three weeks, we had a work colleague host a BBQ at their house and they invited all of us. There were other guys/girls who were driving there so when we made plans I made sure someone else would drive her. However she turned them down quick and she asked me specifically to drive her. I felt really uncomfortable but I agreed. We went to the shops quick and went to the BBQ. I offered to pay just to make it up to her.

Enruote I opened a conversation regarding the date and told her it would have been okay to just say no, she just said she doesn't want to talk about it. I just changed the conversation something lighter and turned the music up.

BBQ went well (I really enjoyed it), some guys decided to go out, I had plans so I was going to drive back home. She decided to come back with me, I dropped her home. She complained the BBQ was boring and when we got to hers I wasn't dropping her close enough to her doorstep.

At this point I am realising we have vastly different interests. I am not sure if I should be friendly with her or just be blunt? I am beginning to realise it is never a good idea to ask a coworker on a date. Hope I am not over thinking this.",2019-07-07 13:19:50,6,1,relationship_advice

361,ca6qtt,theoriginalmorg,My boyfriend [23 M] of almost 3 years is going through a lot and putting a lot of unneeded anxiety on me [21 F],"We have been going through a tough time again since February. I transferred to a university in the fall, and he stayed home to finish community college so he can transfer. Everything was going really well until out of the blue on Valentine’s Day, he had a panic attack about school and failing in life again. He constantly deals with this problem and I told him he should go to therapy to work it out. He agreed but never did it.

We took a three month break because I couldn’t be upset about him while at school and we talked a couple times during that time. 

We got back together when I came back before summer session began. He told me that he thought I was end game, but I came to soon. 

I thought things would be different but he doesn’t really have time for me because he’s busy from 5am-9pm, which isn’t really a problem during the week because I have school so I’m studying all day. He just refuses to let me know what’s happening with him unless we fight or I ask him if he really wants to continue the relationship. 

I’m panicking. I have a lot of anxiety from him not being able to talk to me. If he could just tell me what was going on, I’d be fine but he doesn’t want to rely on me for emotional support.

I feel so dumb that I care about him so much. I really don’t want to break up. I love him so much and we’ve been there for each other through some really lonely times.",2019-07-07 13:19:30,0,1,relationship_advice
362,c9z7o0,toobrokenandhurt,My [M/37] Wife [F/32] is having an affair with a co-worker [M/?]. I still love her and don’t know what to do.,"  

First, sorry for the wall of text, its been like therapy writing this.

We’ve been (or were) together with my wife for 13 years, we have 4 kids ages 2-3-3-7.  For the past year or so we’ve been having a rough time, due to many reasons, we both have a stressful life, very demanding jobs, financial complications and lots of sleepless nights with 4 kids… We both made mistakes by not paying attention to the one another and not talking enough, and it took its toll.

A couple of months ago I began noticing my wife constantly texting with a co-worker (actually she is his direct boss), I asked her what the deal was with that, and she brushed it off as just work stuff, I told her to be careful and that I didn’t like it. I was never a jealous guy, and I trusted her, so I didn’t make a big deal out of it.

She later began constantly going out, sometimes 3 times a week, coming home drunk at 5-6 am. Again, told her that it made me uncomfortable, to not expose herself like that, and that was when I began to suspect something. I started looking at her phone and going through her messages I realized that in fact she was having romantic conversations with her co-worker.

Without telling her that I saw the messages I told her that I know she is having something with her co-worker. I told her to cut it out, she once again dismisses it as that they are just friends.

Finally she came on night again a 5:30 am again, with him again driving her home, I confronted her, I told her that enough was enough, it has to stop, and we need to have a serious talk, we agreed to talk at night, without the kids in the house. A few minutes later I checked her phone again while she went to the bathroom, and she was mocking the situation with her co-worker, how they got caught, and him telling her to tell me that he is just a cool friend.

That night, she came out first asking straight away for a break, I told her that I saw the messages, and she admitted that she was confused. We agreed a break, I left to an apart hotel. One week later she tells me she needs to talk, and told me straight away that she wants to break up, I told her that if she is confused, one week is not enough, why trough everything away, why close all chance of being together.  At that point I was very hurt and angry and told her that I couldn’t be with her at that moment, but that didn’t mean that I’m ready to close that door. She told me that all she knows is that she doesn’t want to be with me anymore. I asked if it was due to be with her co-worker, and she told me that she asked him to move jobs. I was somewhat relieved at that point. I propose couple therapy, just to see if there is any hope, she says no.

A couple of weeks later I talked to her again trying to find any common ground, any sign of hope, but she told me that she is dating her co-worker and that they are officially a couple, that he is changing jobs so that they can be together because she is not willing to sacrifice her job (she is his boss).  She says that she is not in love, that she doesn’t expect a life together with him, but she likes the way he makes her feel, He makes her feel beautiful, intelligent and special, something she hasn’t felt with me for years. I tell her how much this is hurting me, and she says that she needs to focus on herself, not me.  She tells me that she doesn’t know why, but is like she has me blocked and feels nothing for me. I tell her to get therapy to help her clear her head, she doesn’t want to but finally agrees.

Last night I did my final approach, I went to pick up the rest of my things, because I rented an apartment, I opened up completely, I told her how I’m feeling, I told her that I know that I messed up not telling her every day how special she was to me. I propose to start dating, not as a couple, to let’s start over, tell her to stop seeing her coworker and lets see if I can fill the void he leaves, just as he filled an emotional void that I left and he filled. I tell her to give us some time, to see if there is a spark, and if not, the I will accept it and we part as friend and she can go back to him. She says that she cannot do that to him, that she can’t ask him to wait for her.

I told her that I’m not ok, that I haven’t been sleeping, and that I’m going crazy thinking of her with her co-worker. I tell her that I can accept if she doesn’t want to be with me, because of me, but not like this, not for her co-worker. 

She insists that for her, he is nothing serious, that he just makes her feel good. I ask her for time, to ask him for time to clear her head, she has therapy in 5 days, so I ask her to just not be with him for those 5 days, and see if therapy helps her understand what she wants, but she dismissed the idea, implying that it doesn’t work like that she can’t risk losing him, that he is the only thing that makes her feel good right now. I break down completely, crying, explaining how much this is hurting me, that I’m not okay.  She is unmoved, totally emotionless tells me that she knows, but she needs to focus on herself.

I don’t know what to do, I’m broken and hurt, and never in my life have felt so much pain, I start crying just walking down the street. I’m not okay. I looked for therapy, but it is scheduled in over a month, and in the meantime, I don’t know what to do. I still love her, even after all this, for me 13 years and four beautiful children are worth more than my ego or my pride. I feel like I have nothing, and nothing left to lose. I cannot picture myself with anybody else, I was never unfaithful, I was never interested in anybody else, and I can’t even think in looking for someone else right now.

What can I do? what should I do?  do I keep trying to get trough to her by talking, should I keep my distance and let her figure it out herself (even though it literally kills me thinking that he is with him), should I just give up and focus on getting over her.",2019-07-06 21:55:13,22,17,relationship_advice
363,ca47hk,Navajaxks7891,My (31M) girlfriend (31F) of almost three years is getting increasingly infuriated and I don't know what to do,"Ok, I'm spilling my heart out right now. Thank you to anyone that reads and cares to offer perspective.

For context, my girlfriend and I met and kissed and exchanged numbers while I was in the tail-end of my previous relationship (my ex was leaving me for her ex and while we were still ""together"" she was cheating on me and I was waiting for our lease to end to completely separate). I would later find out she was ""on a break"" with a guy when we met, as well. Me ""cheating on my ex with her"" is something that deeply troubled her and as much as I attempt to communicate the situation and as much as she claims to understand, she brings it up from time to time whenever she's upset. We've both been cheated on in previous relationships (myself, have been cheated on in almost every previous one) and we have both tried to communicate that to each other about our insecurities and it is almost something that, for me, gives me more peace knowing she has been hurt like that, too, and can empathize with my inner demons. I am absolutely in love with this woman. I have never felt so powerfully, overwhelmingly in love like this before. I try to do so many small things to show her how often and much I think about wanting to make her happy (I buy her flowers, send flowers to her work just because, write and record songs for her (former recording engineer), give her foot massages after work, ask her out to weekly dinner dates, etc) and try to be as selfless as I can possibly be. This includes compromising and taking responsibility for making her feel upset at times despite it not being my intention nor thinking I've done anything wrong. My conscience is quiet knowing I've never done ANYTHING to put me first and our relationship in flux. She will become angry at small things and state that the small things add up including not putting silverware in the dishwasher the way she prefers, not folding towels the wat she prefers, pillows on the sofa and bed not ""in alignment"" (this is a small sample size) and she will rationalize it saying if I can't get the small things right, how can I get the big, important things right. I have always tried to state that while I may not understand why or agree with this nuanced preferences I am more than willing to learn to comply if it makes her happy. Now, in these moments when she gets angry, she goes from 0 to 100. She will become irate and say the things that I have never been told before: that her ex would get these small things right, that I'm a loser because I don't have my bachelors degree (I'm one class away now!), that I don't make enough money/we're going to be poor forever (I work IT/have A LOT of student loan debt and we rent a 1bd apt literally walking distance to a SoCal beach), that she can't trust me (with the small things) or in general. In our arguments, while trying to always acknowledge how what I have done (whether I agree it was wrong or not) may have made her feel, try to communicate my point of view and she will either not accept it or try to stop me from communicating it to the point where she has taken swings at me and even spit at me (these episodes were where she had been drinking). I try to soothe her in whatever way I can in those moments because I know she must be projecting something from her past whether it be an ex that has hurt her, her dysfunctional family history that I know, or possibly some trauma that she hasn't told me and I know its not her fault. To her credit, she will most of the time reflect later and question why I stay with her when she's ""such a bad person"" and that she doesn't want to treat me that way, and wants to change. I respond I'm with her because I care about her and am in love with her and want to share my life with her. That despite hating to hear all the cruel, twisted, and wicked things she somehow rationalizes saying to me and getting physical assaulted (granted I'm much larger and stronger than her but still you dont hit someone) if she acknowledges it is wrong and takes steps to correct her behavior eg grow as a person and heal herself, I want to be by her side and support her, that I won't abandon her like I think men in her past have.

So....... this brings us to this week... her sister (35f) and niece (2f) and nephew (3m) came and stayed with us (they are still here, possibly leaving today). Last Monday we were soooo happy together, we're both lushes who love to go out on weekends and unwind with a joint at the end of long day/week, and had a great weekend. But, Tuesday morning I woke up with a severe case of vertigo (I've suffered from vertiginous migraines my whole life) to the point she had to text my office to tell them I couldn't come in. She was so sweet, asking me if she could do anything to help (she can't, I can only try to sleep through it). I slept alllllll day and night trying not to impede her first day with her family. The episode continued into the next day. I tried to work but had to leave early I was so nauseated. I go home and sleep again. She gets home from wherever they went and wants to help but again cant........ then says she feels helpless. I try to reassure her it's ok but as I say it she erupts and says I've ""been ignoring her these past two days"" and that I won't even say hi to her niece and nephew. I attempt to disagree but in my fragile condition couldn't muster enough strength to argue and just folded and let her be mad until when she came to bed and with tears in my eyes (because of my migraine and how frustrated I am that she would think that) tried to explain my point of view. And she took it! We made up. Thursday, now, I get home from work super super late (1am) everyone is asleep, I get into the bedroom and her nephew is sleeping next to her in my spot on the bed. No problem! She must love that! I grab a pillow and blanket and plop onto the floor. Suddenly, she wakes up and asks why I'm on the floor and I reply I didn't want to wake them, theres no room, and its all good. She sighs and says she's ""so mad at me right now"" and slams her head back into her pillow. Friday we text throughout the day, its tense but we're ok I think. I get home from work and ask to take them all out to pizza (theres a spot with an arcade for the kids and I can selfishly enjoy a beer there too). Great time despite the palpable uneasiness I feel from her. Afterward, we go to a movie in the park. We park in a spot that Im sketched out about so during the movie I get anxious and restless and get up, she asks whats wrong and I reply (incorrectly, poor language) that I'm bored and need to check on the car I'm afraid of a ticket. She again says ""I'm so mad at you right now"". Well , good thing I checked, her car was literally seconds from getting a ticket. I grab the car, by the time I get back the movie is over and they're ready to go, I explain how close we were to a ticket and she seems appreciative and diffused. We get home go to bed but again the tension is intense I dont even think we kissed good night and I hate that (no matter what at the end of the day I always tell her we should try not to go to bed angry, we should say I love you and kiss good night no matter what bc we're a team, ""us vs the problem). Saturday, they all go to an art festival at the beach while i complete my final paper for my classes. While out I bought myself a watch, wanted it for a long time and Ive been feelin down after this week of frustration. We all get home, she sees the watch and starts to act weird. I ask whats wrong and her sister says ""ok, ill say it, she bought you a watch for your birthday"". I apologized, but had weeks earlier asked her not to get me anything this year. She said she did anyway (thanks for listening) so I haha actually inquired if it was a watch to which she said no. She is not clearly upset again and her sister feeling this says shes going on a walk with the kids. A couple minutes her sister asks if my gf can go outside to watch the kids while she uses the bathroom. On coming out of the bathroom her sister tries to apologize if she started anything I reply no its ok its not her fault its something were going through. Suddenly, my gf opens the door and sees us talking, her sister immediately departs. My gf is infuriated saying she doesnt want me to talk about her to her sister. I try to explain her sister was trying to apologize but she doesnt care and is so upset she says I should leave. I comply and decide to walk to a local bar to reflect and drink a beer. On my way, I run into her sister again, shes now concerned she's ""overstated her welcome"" I try to reassure her shes not. Then my gf calls me, shes sees my and her sisters location on her phone app and is livid that despite just telling me not to talk to her sister I went and did (yes, I see the optics of my actions there and maybe I should have just walked by her but that would be weird to me and she felt awkward and I didn't want her to). She is screaming at me on the phone and concludes the call with saying that ""we're on a break"" (which shes tried to say to me before, and I've said that I don't do breaks, were in it together and she then agreed to) and hung up on me and stopped sharing her location with me. I go to the bar and wait until i think they'll all be asleep to come home. Sunday morning, I wake up early and (maybe irrationally) try to wake her up to ask if she meant what she said, she woke up mad (I can understand, maybe it was the wrong move to wake her up) and said she didn't want to talk. I replied we dont need to have THE BIG TALK at that moment, I just want reassurance that while I'm trying to be patient, give her space, and wait to talk that she still deep down loves me and that we're not on a break and that we're together. She refuses ALL. She's no she doesnt love me and that were not together. Then I made a HUGE MISTAKE, I got sooo upset and started to cry and flipped the comforter blanket up and it knocked over a glass of water then I slammed the door on my way out. A few hours later I came back hoping they'd be gone, her sister was up everyone else was asleep, so I grabbed some clothes for the gym and on my way out told her sister that we were still fighting and that I think my gf wants to break up with me to which she said my gf doesnt mean it. I came back a bit after and wrote her a handwritten note trying to ask to talk through everything and not to separate. Hours later and they again are there. Its awkard as fuck. I offer to cook them dinner or buy them dinner to which they agreed (she finally made eye contact with me at that point). When we had a moment alone I try to speak with my gf and shes so mad. She says I never apologized for leaving the way i did that morning, that I was acting psychotic and woke up her niece and at this rate she was going to go back with her sister when they left. I leave again to give her space. I text her long message to apologize and say i love her to which i get no reply. I get home late and fall asleep. So now yesterday, wake up, go to work, text her i love her and that i hope she enjoys the day with her family and i hope that she doesnt leave with them and that we can talk things out. no reply. i get home from work expecting the worst, that they all have left and im alone. But they are all still there, the kids are running around. So I put on face and try to socialize. My gf and her sister are acting like nothing is wrong and talking to me. Then she gets a call from her Dad, and they both look weird. Its uncomfortable, and I realize her Dad was talking about a trip to Mexico we were all supposed to go to in september. I begin to break down and cry in front of her sister because I feel shes now going to go without me. instead of crying in front of her sister, I step outside for a minute. when I come back my gf asks if i want to go for a walk! what?!! can we talk this out suddenly?! She asks whats wrong....... ummmmm. I say I think shes cutting me out of the mexico trip and she says why would she want to invite me when I have been acting like an asshole all week and drinking so much? I try to acknowledge her feelings (and mistakingly) try to communicate my perspective say Im drinking bc im depressed at where were at and she wont listen to any of it and when I try to again she hits me and says this has to wait until tuesday night. We go back inside and act like nothing happened. Then its time for bed. Her nephew again follows us into bed. I say good night. no reply. I say I love you and she comes back with... thats not appropriate in front her nephew.

So, here I am writing a novel on reddit to strangers hoping to get an objective perspective on what I can do. I want her so much. I am in love with her but recognize there are big big issues. Am I an asshole? Have I been doing things so wrongly? I will admit when I fuck up and I think I reacted badly in some degree to things. If youre still reading thank you and thank you for any advice.

TL;DR  My girlfriend has been getting increasingly infuriated at my behavior despite my thinking that I haven't done anything wrong and I need help understanding if I am wrong and how I can get through this with her",2019-07-07 07:17:46,5,3,relationship_advice
364,ca51z6,friendssucksometime,My friend’s [27F] relationship issues are affecting everyone. What should I do?,"Throwaway account just in case.

There’s unfortunately a lot of people involved, so I’ll try to be succinct and mention only the most important stuff.

I live with four other people, and two of the four [27F, 25M] have seen each other for years. There’s been talk about marriage and kids and yadda yadda. We’ll call them C and L.

C and L have been together since high school, seemed like the perfect lovey dovey couple, all that jazz. For a while, even, they considered themselves to be polyamorous, and once had a third partner but it ended badly. This was a long time ago, however.

A few years ago, C traveled overseas for a year-long study program, and L stayed in the states. They knew they would get lonely, but they each promised that they would not see other people while this lasts.
Unfortunately, they both break that promise. C has a sexual encounter abroad and L starts seeing a person on the side. C, feeling guilty, reluctantly agreed to let L continue seeing this person while they were apart. But jealousy kicks in and C demands L break it off, which takes him several months to do, going so far as to hide the status of his relationship to her and lying about when he actually broke it off.

Fast forward, suddenly L tells C that he’s been doubting their relationship and might be thinking about breaking up, and he cuts off contact with C for two weeks. This sends C into a spiral and suddenly she claims to be suicidal and garners some support from friends to be with her to keep her grounded. One even lives with her for two-three weeks just to “keep her sane”.

Now, where ever there has been C, L was always close behind and vice versa, so EVERYONE knows L and the couple also shares a large friend group. Additionally, everyone seems to know about L cheating on her and every other little problem in their relationship that’s come up.
So anyone C can talk to about L, she would. She’s gone from bad-mouthing him, to calling him names, saying he needs to “grow up and be an adult”, etc. She rants about how she can never trust L again because of the “affair” and that she will threaten to break up with him because he’s such a negative, immature guy and she “doesn’t want him to weigh her down.” Yet in the same breath, she’ll say that she needs him and it’s impossible that they won’t stay together, that “she’s the greatest good he’ll ever get.” If you try to question it or you don’t agree, she takes it as a personal affront, having made accusations that people “aren’t on (her) side” and “guess that everyone believes that she’s the bad guy”.

However, after L gets back into contact, C completely changes her tune. She puts on these rose-colored glasses and talks about how nice it is to hang out again and to just be with him, etc. She clearly feels deeply for him.

Just today, another roommate [24M] returned from several months abroad, and C almost immediately starts dishing another update about her progress with L (by this time they’re testing the waters again and slowly getting back together, I guess.) Mind you, everyone has been listening to her talk about this for weeks, and her waffling on her opinion of L is a constant. 

This time around, C says something like: “I’m SURE we’ll be fine.”
The roommate who just came home — let’s call him Y — essentially tells C that she shouldn’t put all her eggs in one basket just because a few nice things are happening, because that kind of thinking will set her up for major disappointment if/when it doesn’t go exactly as she wants.

C immediately goes from amicable to closed-off animosity. Immediately, she starts accusing Y of trying to turn her into a pessimist and that she “just got over being suicidal” and “she shouldn’t have talked to Y” and blurting out a string of self-destructive language. C essentially accuses Y for bringing her into a shitty mood and making her question her relationship with L all over again.

I understand venting for the sake of venting. Sometimes you just need someone to listen. But venting and complaining feels like *all* C has been doing, and I have heard personal accounts of frustration and annoyance from mutual friends. 
I have personally tried to stay out of it as much as I can because it’s an issue between C and L alone that they need to work out together. I also am friends with the both of them, so it’s even harder.
Additionally, I have very little information about L’s side of the story or how he’s been acting (outside of hearsay from C), and I’m reluctant to reach out anyway in fear of C turning to accuse me of something. I’ve also been known to put my foot in my mouth. When we talk about anything else, she’s great to be with. But when it comes to L, it’s like walking on eggshells. It’s gotten so toxic and out of hand that I might try to ignore her from here on out if she tries to rant again, for the sake of my sanity and our friendship.


What should I do, if anything at all?




TL;DR: Friend/Roommate goes on toxic tirades about her boyfriend and had roped many people in on her problems. Will accuse close friends of picking sides if they don’t agree with her and will lash out when given a reality check.

366,ca6ovz,throwawayhelp_123,I’m not okay with being alone (25F),"I’ve been in 3 relationships since I was 18 and I’ve never been alone for more than ~3-4 months.

My first was a year, second was 3.5 years and last one was almost a year. None of them have been rebounds as I’ve put my 100% attention and effort into each. 

My latest ex just broke up with me and this was the best relationship I’ve ever been in. With my previous two exes, I didn’t feel this hurt and this upset when we broke up and I honestly knew it was for the best. In this case, all I want is for him to come back.

I know this is 50% driven by my genuine like for my ex and 50% because I just don’t want to be alone. Is it so wrong to not want to be alone? People keep telling me to use this time to work on myself etc, but I know what went wrong in my relationships and I’ve done enough self reflections over the last month. Is it wrong if I put myself out there again because I don’t want to be alone?

It’s not easy for me to really like someone so I know I won’t fall for anyone who’s just a replacement or lead anyone on if I genuinely don’t feel anything for them.",2019-07-07 13:13:13,4,0,relationship_advice
367,ca50tf,bubblybxby,my boyfriend keeps talking about cute girls.,"he (18m) casually talks about other girls being attractive but gets upset when i (18f) mention another guy. and my thing is, i never do it to upset him at all i talk about things that aren’t a big deal. like i won’t talk about them being cute or how they are so flirty with me. but he does it. he has talked about his sexual experiences and i didn’t mind, but once i talked about my ONE experience (after he basically forced me to talk about sex in the first place) he flipped.

the other week he commented on a video of a girl saying, “she’s fine as hell” and then sent me the post talking about something she was doing. i strongly feel that he sent me the post knowing i’d see the comment and get annoyed. just now he sent me a post of a girl saying, “she’s very cute.” i said true just to avoid letting him know it’s annoying when he does this but IT IS SO ANNOYING AND MAKES ME JEALOUS. is it really necessary to do these things? there have been other times.

how should i talk to him about this?

he upsets me easily and is aware of this. he pretty much brags on how good he is at upsetting me. he also said he finds it cute when i’m mad. then he said he doesn’t feel bad for making mad because he doesn’t have to. i don’t understand this, but it has made me worry about talking to him about things he does wrong.",2019-07-07 09:24:55,4,2,relationship_advice

371,ca6mf8,Syanth,Me (22M) having trouble deciding how to keep going or what I want from my girlfriend (24F),"So I dont really know where to start because everything is kinda hectic and I have thought so many times about this but I cant seem to find the correct answer so I guess i'll make this a long story. Awhile ago me and this girl started off having sex with eachother now the plan was to only have sex and no other feelings. After awhile she said she started having feelings and I dind't really know where I was in this whole situation but I said that we could atleast try and see what happends, a month later and we start having some problems. Our sex is amazing and I want to keep this girl exclusively for me (jelousy and safety reasons) but I couldn't ever figure out if I want a true relationship or if it's just me being greedy wanting me for herself.

So we try the relationship thing, the thing is im a very introvert person so after a day of being with someone I just need to be alone play some games or do some other stuff on my own. However she really likes being together all the time but I just cant mentally do it, it's way too exhausting for me and just generally isn't good for my health. However she doesn't see it this way, she is worried that I would leave to go to friends and do other stuff and doesn't understand why I don't want to be with her all the time.

I feel like I really like this person, maybe even love this person because I want to see her happy and it makes me happy seeing her be happy but it feels like I am the person sacrificing alot in this relationship while she doesn't do it that much. We always watch what she wants to watch we always do what she wants to do and if I recommend maybe watching something I like to watch she just says she's not in the mood for it. This makes it really hard on me because I already have problems developing feelings ( I never really get butterfly feelings for anyone ) and this person doesn't even want to show interest in any of the stuff I like.

There also is the point where she thinks I lie alot, for example I told her we would go to a BBQ with my family at 12 PM (she wouldnt be there) so I texted her at 1 PM while I was in the gym because we would go to the BBQ later because my mom had to do something. Now she gets very upset because I dind't tell her that I would be at the BBQ later because I never even thought about telling her ( I dont see the need to tell someone my every move or every small change in my day ) but for her it feels like im lying and that my storys just dont add up (this is 1 example this has happend like 3 other times).

So I told her it would be best to just remain friends or atleast be friends with benefits (sexually we click very well) but now I really miss being with her, however I know that if I spend the day with her again at the end I would want nothing more to go back home and relax.

&amp;#x200B;

Would there be anyway to ever make something like this work, I probably forgot alot of details because it's quite alot but this is extremely hard for me, she has a bad history of her ex boyfriend lying and doing drugs behind her back but she doesnt seem able to drop those trust problems and keeps projecting them on me.

&amp;#x200B;

i hate my family. some of you may say ""hate is a strong word"" that's why i'm using it. all my life i've been the outsider, the one who never does best at anything, the one they leave out, the one who they don't want around, even the one who they bully every day. that's my life.  


dealing with my family is very hard on a day to day basis especially with my nan who thinks i should be prettier like my cousins and my half-sister. on holidays since i was born they have tried to make me girlier or less emo or be a normal girl and i hate it. i can never wear anything i like or have my hair or make-up how i want because it's not ""lady like"".  


we have always went to the same exact caravan park since i was very young and it's always been my favourite, that's where we are going this year. we leave in 8 weeks from now and since i found out my uncle booked a holiday i already didn't want to go because of the abuse i receive from a daily basis but worse when i'm on holiday.  


i have severe depression gotten from my family issues, so me going on holiday and sitting there by myself doing nothing is worser than me staying home and getting some me time for once. also looking after our 13 year old dog because he's too ill to come on holiday. what do i do? thanks so much.",2019-07-07 12:59:20,4,1,relationship_advice

What do I do?,"My boyfriend had someone close to him die two days ago and I have been trying to be supportive and loving to him during this hard time. He hasn’t been wanting to talk about it and has been very angry. Yesterday, I told him that I would let him have some alone time, since he seemed to hate me being around. I told him that he can call me if he needs anything to which he replied, “I don’t fucking need you!” He then slammed the door in my face. He has been sad one minute, angry the next and then he will apologize. Only to be angry at me again a few minutes later. If I try to give him space to deal with his emotions, he gets mad at me too. I don’t know what to do. Should I just leave him alone and let him deal with himself; or should I try and be there for him. Any advice? Thanks.",2019-07-07 12:57:30,4,1,relationship_advice
377,ca6hba,hypernovapulsar,"My (39m) marriage is ending with my wife (40f), doesn't seem to be a hope to recover. I want my marriage back.","I have been with my wife for over 20 years.  It's been the best 20 years of my life.  Yesterday I was crushed when she said I've never been there for her when she needed me the most, and ended by saying she wanted a divorce.  I was nearly catatonic.  She said that it had been building up for 6-12 months...she can't pinpoint it.   She said she doesn't love me.

While I basically agree with her on most counts, I highly disagree with her on many other counts.  I wasn't there for her during two particularly hard ordeals.  I was working.  I didn't try to make an excuse for those.  I accept those.  I failed her.  What I disagree with is her saying I never go to help her family out and never went on trips to her parents house 10 hours away for a week.  We typically have a vacation every year, so that eats up a week.  That left me with one week many times early on.  I tried to save that week in case I needed to stay home for sick children.  Pretty much every time I didn't need to use but one or two days, but I wanted the safety net so I wouldn't have an unpaid day.

Early on in our marriage money was tight.  She was always worrying about it.  So I made it a point to get as much overtime as was available, which wasn't much back then.  Maybe 10-15 hours.  I didn't want her worrying about money.  She seems to be holding that against me.  I still did it as late as a few years ago because we were trying to blast through our mortgage.  We had less than 40k on a 150k home after only about 12 years.  I was then changed to salary, so my overtime pay ceased.  I would be home more, and could be there.  But I think I've been playing video games too much.  But I don't think it's as bad as she thinks it to be.  In fact, I'm willing to renounce all video games.  I've been feeling less of a desire to play them lately anyway.

She's essentially said that for the last 6-12 months, she's been dropping subtle hints about our marriage.  Our 20 year marriage, and her technique to save it is to drop subtle hints.  While I've been downstairs, she's been upstairs on her phone, originally claiming to want to get away from our grandchild.  As far as I know, whenever she's expressed a desire to cuddle, I've never turned her down.  

I've never been particularly astute with women, or woman in this case.  I've never been with anyone else in my life.  She liked me for months on end before we started dating, and I never knew.

She apparently was in love with another boy during high school.  She said they had dated for 5 years, and that she never got over him.  She's friends with his mother, and visits her house frequently, and all of these feelings started bubbling up again during the last month.

I've tried telling her I'm willing to go to counseling.  I'm willing to get rid of video games.  I'm willing to do whatever.  She's said that it's too late.  While we're still in the same house right now, I feel it's best if I head to my parents' house.  She has said she doesn't want anything in the divorce except her car.  I told her I don't want anything but her.  She can have the house.  I don't want her staying in a dangerous apartment in a potentially bad neighborhood. 

I'm still going to go to marriage counseling.  With or without her.  But my life just seems like it's over, and there's no hope of bringing the spark back.",2019-07-07 12:49:37,7,1,relationship_advice
378,ca6h8q,anonymouss2k19,Long term relationship rant - arguing,"This is my 2nd post, weighing up my options to see if a break up is inevitable in a long term relationship. I have no one to talk to or lean on in my real life without being judged

- In a lease contract which ends October 2019 (only my name is on the lease)
- Unsure if my mum who relocated will give me financial support to rent a 2 bed flat to look after my 16 year old sister as I can't afford this on my own (she currently lives with us) 
- partner can afford a decent sized house deposit for us next year

Argument: 

1.We were shopping and he literally would not let me put a jar of sauce in the basket when there was space and demanded I go and get another basket so I did. I was embarrassed and felt like a small child..

2. He said I needed to pay for the shopping as he bought some bits and McDonalds for us after we went cinema. This annoyed me  as he didn't  want to go halves either. I never feel he's ever repaid me helping him out in uni or when he was unemployed.
 I pointed this out the other day and he said ""we've evened out"". In the past I've paid for a week trip holiday, overnight stay and paid for all his computer parts. He has never taken me out anywhere unless I initiate it. We went out for a meal a few months ago and he said to go halves. This was the day after he went out for drinks with his friends so obviously didn't want to overspend too much in a weekend...
So yes that killed the romantic vibe

After the shopping we got into an argument as I was driving and he says ""your just like your mum"". He's always expressed his disdain for her and knows he will get a reaction out of me by bringing her up. He tends to do this when we argue and I did say why do you always bring other people into the argument when it's just us 2. So I started commenting on his family dynamics which he didn't like. I said his dad is boss of the household and once saw his mum move so fast when his dad couldn't find something.

I bought up what I mentioned in my previous post about him buying a £200 tablet, spending £120 on a work event in October with work when he said he didn't want to go on holiday because the flat lease ends around this time. To this he said

""No you are chronologically wrong I did not say that, you are so stupid"".

""I'm more intelligent then you so I'm probably right"" 

He will never admit something he's said or avoid the point I'm trying to make when we argue.

At the end of the argument and I said my dad never liked him and viewed him as a sponge. (Partner never had a job as he was at uni) and my partner said "" my dad didn't understand university, he worked in a warehouse so your mum could fuck a guy)"" and slammed my car door. 

Yes my mum cheated on my dad for a long time and my dad died 3 years ago which really fucked me up. For him to say that about someone who worked so hard to provide for his family and my dad who was always there when I had my operations growing up. I ended up driving to a random place to compose myself and burst into tears.

When I came home I didn't speak to him and he just said ""are you dumping me"" before even saying sorry or apologising. I said ""no"" and he said he was sorry for bringing my mum into the argument.

Now it's the day after I'm alone in my bedroom watching stranger things. .

I don't feel like I'm in a loving supportive relationship. He's never there emotionally for me and has never gone out of his way to be there for me. 

I just needed to vent

381,ca40t8,throwaway4981247,My wife (27F) wants me (30M) to consider a one-night affair to potentially heal sexual trauma between us.,"Long story short, my wife and I met in another country while vacationing. We really hit it off, but I wasn't sure if we would have long-term relationship potential at the time due to us living on opposite ends of the U.S. I ended up staying a few more days after she flew home, and got really drunk and slept with a prostitute. I barely remember any of it but I never told her.

We had no mention of exclusivity at the time, but ended up staying in touch and eventually dating long-distance before she moved in with me after a year. Fast forward a few years and she was looking through my phone and saw an old conversation I had with a friend about it. She asks me about it and I made the mistake of denying it initially before finally fessing up. After a long fight and couples counselling we finally forgave each other, but since then, sex has not been the same for either of us. It's verrrrry slowly improved, but she almost cries every time we have sex and we don't know what to do to. She sat me down and strongly suggested that having a one-night affair to remember what healthy sex with no baggage was like and reawaken ourselves might be our best shot.

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? Is it possible for two generally monogamous people to have a one-night affair and return to normalcy?  


Edit: I should add that my wife says that while she feels strongly about the possibility of this helping her, if I'm too uncomfortable than she won't do it, and our relationship is the priority.",2019-07-07 06:50:32,15,3,relationship_advice
382,ca4v5d,Pants_Bad,"Should I be upset about girlfriend I broke up with getting into another relationship 2 weeks after, while we still live together?","I (M29) broke up with my SO (F28) after we'd been dating for a year and a half. We were quite serious, but after realizing there were some things that we couldn't find compromise on, I decided that unfortunately I couldn't see the relationship working long term. It was not an easy choice to make because I cared about her a lot. We still have 4 months left on our apartment lease. We talked afterward and decided that it would be best for both of us in our current positions to see our lease to its end before moving out, mostly for financial reasons. We set some boundaries, I told her that I knew she would eventually start dating again and that's fine, but agreed that neither of us would bring other interests to our apartment. What I didn't expect is that she would go on a date literally a week after we broke up, and become officially dating that person a whole 2 weeks after the breakup. 

I'm still processing my emotions of us not being together in the first place, and while I didn't expect her to avoid seeing people the whole time we lived together, 2 weeks later? Really? This shocked me. She had not so subtly hinted about wanting us to get married a month earlier. This made my decision to end our relationship even more difficult to do. I'm totally baffled that she was able to move on to the first person she met that quickly. I know that I ended our relationship, so part of me feels that I shouldn't be able to get mad about this, but I am pretty upset anyway. Personally, I don't plan to even think about dating for a couple months at least to have some me time. Plus I think dating someone else so quickly is pretty disrespectful to the ex when you're still living together like we are. Am I in the wrong for being kinda pissed off or is some of that feeling justified?",2019-07-07 09:00:57,3,2,relationship_advice
383,ca3zze,AtlasVIII,Confronted the lady my partner's been cheating on me with,"After I saw her update her Facebook profile picture of her and my 'partner', I finally got the courage to message her on Facebook asking her if she was seeing him as well. She was just as appalled as me when she found out that he's been seeing us both for over 6 months. 

I first met him through a friend and we got together just as a bit of fun, but we worked out that we wanted to be something more. 

So fast forward a bit, I suspect he's seeing someone else since he's hiding his phone constantly and making excuses as to why he's not replying to my messages. I search his FB friends to see if there's anyone that it might be. 

I asked him about it and he makes excuses and denies things and apologizes for being so distant. Things improved for a bit till today. He hasn't messaged me all weekend and see one of his friends has a selfie of him and her. I message her to ask if she's seeing him and she confirms it. 

We end up chatting the whole day working out this whole time he's been living two lives. I had been seeing him for 9 months and she has been seeing him for 6. We confirmed so many BS lies he's been telling both of us. I'm his ""mate he games with"" and she's the ""mate he helps move""

He was at her house that weekend, so that explains why he didn't message me at all. I send her evidence of the chats him and I have, and here's she telling me hes introduced her to his family and his friends as his girlfriend, and everytime I've asked him if I could meet his friends he's made excuses. 

Turns out he's promised to marry her, almost had a baby with her, was going on a cruise with her. So we're both very upset at this. She's apologizing for seeing him when I was with him and I'm apologizing to her for being the side bitch even though I was with him months before. We're comparing all the lies he's told us both and it all makes complete sense. Stuff she tells me links up to stuff he's told me. 

So she confronts him at her place, kicks him out and tells him she's done. I message him some not so lovely messages since I was really upset. 

-----------------------

So later tonight I message him on his number saying how hurt I am and that he's an asshole etc
He calls me saying what she's been saying is lies and that she's insane and he's been trying to break up with her for months, and yet she was saying he wanted to break up with me for months. He's saying he doesn't love her and that he loves me, and I'm telling him that he clearly doesn't if he was sleeping with someone else.  So now I'm caught in this storm of misinformation and lies because he's saying she's not telling the truth. I ended up just telling him that I need space and that things won't go back to how they were. 

He's promising to always have his phone open and that I mean the world to him and that he didn't realise what he's lost till it's gone. I think he's just realised that both of these people he's been sleeping with have called him out on his BS and now he's trying to manipulate me back into sleeping with him :/

----------

He's never gonna change is he?

TL;DR
Guy I'm seeing is cheating on me, girl he's cheating on me with he clearly loves more (promise ring, almost a baby). Message her and we call him out on his BS and break it off with him. He calls me wanting me back, telling me I'm the one he loves more. 

I needed to rant, please tell me he's just trying to get me back cause he's lost everything and he thinks I'm weak.",2019-07-07 06:47:15,12,3,relationship_advice
384,ca8ow1,stonewms0404,My GF is an anti-vax for a good reason. I want to vax our kids. What should I do about this?,"So my girlfriend (highschool age. Same as me. Yes I know “you guys won’t stay together!” But we are very reasonable and can solve problems that arise) is an anti-vax because she got very ill when her parents vaccinated her as an infant which is very rare. She’s the kind of person if she is going to do something then nothing is going to stop her from doing it. She said that she’s not up to negotiation either. I know this is a very reasonable anti-vax person. But her mom turned into a typical Karen anti-vax, ya know the Whole Foods, going away from bad food (my gf hasn’t had a taco in her life). What should I do about this? If there is even anything I can do...

Edit: Thank you everyone for the advice. I know that people are pretty much telling me to leave her, and that’s fine. But the next thing for us is to get through college and still be partners. If that happens. Then I’ll be sure to make another post here (if reddit still exist. Which it totally will).

Edit 2: I talked with her. And she told me that if it wouldn’t effect negatively, would help, and wasn’t pointless. Then she’d do it. So I think that we’re fine.

385,ca3yvd,xsoutherndiscomfortx,I (25f) spoke up about bullying going on in my main friendship group’s chat and I got kicked out. I feel that it’s affecting my ability to be friends with some of them outside of the chat.,"So I’ve been in a friendship group for about 8-10 months and overwhelmingly I’ve made really positive bonds with them. I was added into the group chat and it’s mostly just sharing memes or whatever, but occasionally they will make jokes at the expense of other people we work with who are not in the chat. I decided on Thursday to say to them that I wasn’t comfortable with it, and that I didn’t get a good gut feeling about it. I said I’d like to stay in the group but was really conflicted/uncomfortable with the sledging/bullying. No one said anything for about 5-10 minutes or so, then the group admin removed me without saying anything to me. I immediately felt a great sense of rejection, and feeling that I was not being heard or allowed to speak my piece. No one from the group said anything to me, and when I brought it up with the person in the group who I trusted most he (f1) just played devils advocate and didn’t really seem to understand where I was coming from with having hurt feelings. I brought it up with another friend (f2) who completely avoided the topic other than saying, “that’s [the removing of me from the group] just Jim’s [friend name changed for confidentiality] way of being funny. That’s just Jim being Jim.” 

Since then I’ve only had one other friend (f3) reach out to me about it, who said he was quite uncomfortable with it too. Other than that, no one has said anything to me about it. F2 especially has been trying to just banter as normal, and f1 hasn’t said anything. At the moment I feel very much like distancing myself from this group of friends - I feel like no one backed me, even the ones who I really trusted, and no one has considered my feelings. I feel as though it’s getting swept under the rug, and that everyone is just trying to ignore it. I haven’t been added back into the group again. The way this has made me feel is that they prioritised being able to shit talk, and that they saw the risk of damaging a friendship with me as worth it. I don’t really know what to do. 

For context too, I am the youngest group member. The next age group is two 26 year olds, then all 29+ year olds. There are 7 of us.",2019-07-07 06:42:48,7,3,relationship_advice

390,c9vx4f,my_o,Found out my [31M] wife [28F] was raped twice in two days by 2 different men when we were dating. Her story does not add up though.... am I an asshole to call bullshit...? (TRIGGER WARNING:- RAPE),"I found out about this by reading some old FB messages when she left her account open on my laptop. I know I shouldn't snoop, and I have no idea why I did, but FUCK was I not ready for what I saw. I confronted her here's her version of events. This all happened in the first month we were dating:-

*********************************************

***GUY 1***

This guy was a class above her in school who she reconnected with 6 months before when he saw her in the same politics group as him on Facebook. He was married. 

The messages start out innocent enough but then they swap numbers and turn flirty mostly from his side. He keeps asking to meet her and that his wife can't find out. She agrees but claims it was ""just as a friend"", and she had no indication whatsoever that he thought of her as anything other than a friend.

She picked him up from the train station because he lives a few hours away and they went somewhere for food. She claims the conversation was never flirty or sexual in any way. They go back to her apartment to wait for his train and he meets her roommates and they go into her room to talk some more. 

Once the door is closed he makes a move and starts taking off her pants. She asks him what he is doing, they are just friends and she doesn't want this. He smiles and keeps taking off her pants and then panties while she said she froze. He bends her over the bed and fucks her and then cums on her ass really quickly. She said he was not forceful, she was just scared and froze, did not cry out to her friends and at any point could have just walked over to the door and opened it where 2 of her friends were right outside the door. She just didn't? After he was done he put his pants back on and left immediately and she never told anyone what had happened.

The messages after this ""meeting"" were ridiculously sexual from him, sending her dick pics, asking for another meeting (which never happened) and she responded positively to every one, even complimenting the size of his penis. She even asked his advice about me! Her story is that she was pretending she hadn't just been raped and that he was still a friend, and that she did not and would not ever meet him again. 

After a few weeks he called her and she claims she told him that me and her were serious and she needed to not be in contact with him anymore. That's why she claims the messages abruptly stop.

**************************************************

***GUY 2***

THE FOLLOWING DAY after the first rape she goes on a work night out, and what I didn't know was that one of the guys at work was her ex boyfriend and currently trying to get back with her. 

At the end of the night she was drunk and someone had stolen her phone and money, and her ex boyfriend offered to get a cab home with her and pay for it. She says she expected him to just drop her off at home, but when the cab stopped he got out with her and followed her into her apartment. She says she was too drunk to appreciate what was happening and they both just ""crashed"" fully clothed onto her bed and fell asleep fully clothed.

She woke up the following morning naked with a vague memory of him undressing her and having sex with her during the night. They were both very hungover and he left quickly before they could talk properly.

The FB messages afterwards was her asking him what happened and him confirming they had vaginal and anal sex. She asked him whether she gave him a BJ and sat on his face for him to eat her out and he confirmed that she did. I asked her why she said that if she had no memory, and she claimed she was ""just trying to work out what had happened"" and that she knew she didn't give him a BJ or take any active part whatsoever. 

She continued working with that guy for a year afterwards, but claimed she also told this guy me and her were serious and that his why his messages abruptly stop after this too. She claims he even ignored her in work because he was pissed at her for choosing me over him. 


*****************************************************

This sounds so far fetched her story can't be true can it? I WANT to believe her but this just seems so unlikely that I would be an absolute fool to believe her wouldn't I?

I don't know what implications this has for our marriage because these messages and these events are a few years old now, and we have since got married and had a kid that is the image of me. She has also given up work and is a full time mom, while I work from home. So if she's currently cheating or anything I would definitely notice, and there are no red flags or warning signs in her behaviour whatsoever. She's a dedicated wife and mother and always has been.

Obviously I'm upset because at least she made the decision to meet with a dodgy married man behind his wife's back, and let her ex boyfriend sleep in her bed with her the first month we were dating. The rest is either 2 horrible rapes she endured in silence for years, or 2 guys she cheated on me with at the very start of our relationship, depending on what you believe.

Help! Should I believe her? She refuses point blank to go to the cops or have counselling. She says it was a long time ago and wants the past in the past.

393,ca4r7q,noduckshere94,I (25f) am talking to a guy (33m) and I am unsure if I should pursue it. Should I walk away?,"So this guy is seemingly different from the guys Im normally attracted to, and it's refreshing. There are a few things that I have reservations about but I am unsure that they are worth cutting off contact

- most notably, he's 33. I am 25 and still am in college (graduate school)
- he occasionally smokes but says that he would stop if I wanted to ( I didn't ask him to, I just said I am against smoking)
- he lives about 45 away
- he is not someone I would personally consider conventionally attractive (but to be fair, I've dated guys who were ""perfect"" physically and they were a major letdown ) 

He seems sweet enough, and I dont FEEL the age difference, yet. But I mean, he's 33. I imagine he is looking to get married and start a family, but I don't have the intention to do that until I'm HIS age. I know this sounds like an open and closed case (walk away) but theres something about him that I'm really drawn to, I cant explain it. What should I do?",2019-07-07 08:43:33,6,2,relationship_advice
394,ca6ay4,lunarlivana,Made out with a friend who is best friends with the guy I actually have a crush on??,"Okay so context is that I got dumped two months ago by the guy I thought I would marry. I’ve been extremely devastated but I’ve been doing my best to carry on and rebuild my life. During this Summer I’ve had to take classes, and by staying in my college town I ran into and became closer to a friend from my major classes. Flash forward two weeks post breakup and Kevin* and I are hanging out in my apartment playing video games. Suddenly he asks if I want to kiss and I say yes, and he spends the night. Given, I was pretty drunk at the time, so in the morning, I was very embarrassed and instantly regretted this. We talked afterwards and I said I just wanted to remain friends. Flash forward another couple weeks and he invites me over to the place where he is dog sitting to hangout and chill. I say yes, and we drink and hangout. Again, the same scenario plays out. And again, I wake up horribly embarrassed and regretful. We talked and agreed that this was never going to happen again. SO on the 4th of July Kevin organized a small get together at his house, and during this time I got wasted. However, at the end of the night when everybody went home (I crashed on his couch) I went into his room and kissed him. This time, I realized however that this was not a good path to lead down, and I left his room and crashed on the couch as planned. The next morning, we both pretended that nothing happened, and I left.

Basically, I have genuine feelings for his best friend, who I have also started to become close to. He has come over a couple of times and nothing has happened, which I actually prefer, and this is a very recent development. HOWEVER, I don’t know how to approach this situation at this point, and I want to make sure that nobody’s feelings get hurt. Last night, Kevin asked me if he could ask me a question, but I was asleep and didn’t see it until this morning. 

YES, I know that this is my fault. I don’t need any blame comments, since we all know that this has been messy in large part to me. So please just comment advice on how best to move forward with this. I just want to save my friendship with Kevin and not ruin my chances with our mutual friend.",2019-07-07 12:27:50,2,1,relationship_advice

It’s just that a lot of people have been telling me that I should be careful with him because they’ve seen him oit with some other girl.

My boyfriend was the only person that could pick her up that day. He did tell me about it.

Anyways other than that, my gut is telling me something else. I feel that he’s been unfaithful, I just don’t have the proof. My older sister and mom are telling me that he’s definitely been unfaithful even though they claim to have proof but won’t show me.

397,ca4nk0,Swappp27,I think my sister has Anger issues.. My parents aren't taking the literal signs.,"So yeah I am M(16) and my sister is like 12. My parents are typical Asian parents and when I say they are really toxic towards me since the start and I m thinking of moving out after 12th but this isn't the problem.

The problem is that my parents always fight after my father turns up drunk and for the last 10 years I have seen them nothing but to fight . 

This took a  toll on my mental health but I started avoiding them and ignoring them so I am fine now. 

But my sister is the worst affected by it. She has Anger issues. Like real bad anger issues.( It started after she started living with us instead of our grandparents). 

So my mom and dad have always hated me no matter what. No matter how hard I try. They just keep bitching around and I have learned to ignore them. 
But my sister is the opposite. She isn't good in anything. When I say anything. I mean it! Nothing!!. 

She doesn't have any friends cause whenever she gets in a minor fight with her firends. She calls our parents and it turns into a major issue and so finally kids of my neighborhood have stopped talking to her and she talks to a girl who is 2 years older than her and is also a loner. 

But the thing comes when she gets angry. She literally starts crying even on small things and my mother always accepts whatever she wants
 So now even on small things like using phone or using TV remote . She will throw a fit if no one agrees to her. 

And I feel scared from her. Even though I am almost a foot taller than her but she has tried many times to seriously harm me and you know what! My parents don't give a fuck!. 

So what do I do now? Any advice how to counter this. 
I have tried telling this to my extended family. But they are like she is a girl you should support her and take care of her. 

They want  me to take care of someone who can kill me when she gets angry and this is the reason why I don't stay at home alone with her. I always go and crash at my friends place and then my parents think I am being not responsible and acting like a asshole. 
Help guys. 
I just want to tolerate them for maybe 1.5 years more then I am gonna move out for my further studies. 

I am on phone so yeah. Forgive any typos.",2019-07-07 08:27:28,0,2,relationship_advice

I’ve always struggled with girls and have only been an a few dates that weren’t successful. I’m not really a loser because I’m in the military so I’m doing something with my life but if I didn’t join I would be such a neckbeard.  whenever I see an attractive girl I just freeze up and avoid eye contact and try not to look at them.

400,ca65nb,_Naptune_,"I [M17] love a girl [F17] but I don't know her that well and want to get to know her, but not sure how to approach it","So I believe I've just found genuine love for the first time. Let me say I've had crushes before, but based on lust. A few months later I would look back and question how I ever convinced myself I liked them. But this time, it feels different. Whenever I see her I just have a nice, warm feeling in my chest. 

Let's start off with the fact that she's in a grade above me. I'm older than most of my grade, so in reality we're only a month apart in age. But, because she's in a grade above me, I don't get to see her often. This last school year I had a science class with her, and I started off not really taking much notice of her. But, soon enough, something sort of unconsciously grew on me, and I found myself glancing over at her often, and feeling a warmth whenever I heard her laugh. I didn't realize it until this summer, but I love her, and I can't stop thinking about her.

Next year she is going to graduate, and I know if  don't do something I'll regret it. I've talked to her a few times, but never had a real conversation and the only time I've seen her outside school is at her job at an ice cream shop. She knows me and definitely doesn't dislike me, but we're certainly not friends.

I want to talk to her and get to know her better, and then tell her how I feel. I can't just come out of the blue and say ""Hey I love you"". That'd be weird, and she probably doesn't trust me or know me enough to even say yes. I follow her on Instagram, which is the only social media I use besides Snapchat. I've thought about talking to her on Instagram just to get comfortable, but I'm not even sure how to approach that. Just messaging her ""Hey let's talk"" would be weird, and what would we even talk about? I told my friend and his girlfriend about it, and they encouraged me to just send her a message sometime.

(I should also mention her Instagram is mainly just selfies and stuff, nothing I could really strike a conversation out of. She does have a Twitter with different content, so I could maybe make a Twitter and talk to her that way?)

I've thought about maybe going to get some ice cream when she's working and maybe talk a bit, and tell her I think she's a cool person and I'd like to talk more.

How should I do this? How would I go about messaging her and getting to know her? I'm nervous, and I just want to do something before I lose the chance...

TLDR: I like a girl, but I don't really know her that well and would like to get to know her. I'm not sure what to do. Should I just try messaging her? Should I try and see her in real life?",2019-07-07 12:08:47,0,1,relationship_advice

402,ca3q8y,kindemokid,"Bf (19) and I (18F) went on break, now he’s with someone I’ve been jealous of","So, for some background, my bf and I have been together for around 2 years. We’ve always been really good together and for each other. However, we were starting to have some problems in about May. We both struggle with mental health issues, and apparently he got really bad around then. Unfortunately, I wasn’t aware of it because he didn’t tell me. I’ll admit that my own problems sometimes get in the way of being supportive or comforting, but completely hiding what you feel from your SO? 

That’s where this girls comes in. 

They worked together and became friends at work. The thing is, this girl is bad news. She does drugs and whatnot. Around this time, she started to get really close to him. She would tell him all of her problems and claim that he was the only one there for her. Long story short, he stopped her from killing herself. I’m glad that she’s still alive, but during this time she would call my bf multiple times a day and became somewhat obsessed with him. He even started going to her instead of me with his problems because he didn’t feel like I could support him properly. Now, I’ve never been jealous before, but I started to feel a bit uncomfortable with how close they were getting. 

Since we’re in college, the school year ended in May. About a week into summer vacation, this girl is apparently unhappy with the fact that my bf and I were still together, and she wanted us to break up. Instead of just insisting that I would still be around, my bf decided to tell her (with my permission) that we broke up, but stayed friends. 

Not too long afterwards, that actually happens. It wasn’t because of her, it was actually because I’m bi and I wanted some experience dating girls. He claimed he wanted a future with me and everything. We have been together for more than two years after all. For during the break, we agreed that he could also see other people, since it would only be fair. 

So naturally, he starts dating this girl. 

I was really upset when I found out, and that hasn’t gone away at all. I don’t even care about dating girls anymore, I just want to get back with my bf. Ive tried bringing that up to him, but he says that he can’t do that because of her. Shouldn’t I, the gf of two years, be the obvious choice? I still get extremely upset when I found out that they’re hanging out, especially since she lives more than an hour away. 

This is just too much for me emotionally. I’m thinking of telling him that it’s either her or me. I’m at my wits end and can’t handle it anymore. Would I be a bad person for leaving him if he doesn’t leave her? Am I crazy for being upset over this?

Edit: For some clarity, my bf and I aren’t entirely broken up. We’re still very close and hang out frequently and talk all the time. He also still tells me loves me and wants to be with me. 

Another important detail that I probably missed is that I didn’t really want to go on a break. I would have liked an open-relationship/polyamory kind of deal, but agreed to a break because my bf seemed to think it necessary.",2019-07-07 06:08:42,10,3,relationship_advice
403,ca64l3,MikeHarker90,Please!! I feel bad for feeling hurt and need help to make things up!! Long read,"My Girlfriend and I are incredibly close now. We've lived together (although she doesnt want to admit she actually living here) a few months now.
   For the past few days shes been feeling really stressed and has had a lot going on. Shes been sp focused on what stressing, she hasnt been able to focus on making herself happy or doing anything she likes.
   So yesterday I invited her out to go to a local bar/club with me. She loves to dance although idk how lol. She also loves to drink socially and just genuinely likes to have fun. At first when I invited her to go out she said no, that she wasn't up for it. After a few minutes I convinced her it would be good for her. Now when my girlfriend goes out she goes all out, she loves to do her makeup and get dressed up, she spends over an hour doing her makeup alone bc she loves it that much. Shes not freaking out and stressing when shes doing her makeup, she is grinning and singing her favorite songs lol. Shes told me in the past that she has almost as much fun doing her makeup as she does going out sometimes. 
  I worked until about 6 that evening and headed straight home to find her about halfway through with her makeup, smiling and singing country. We had plans to go to a club that had a band playing rock music that night, and so I suggested we go to the ""country"" club where she can dance to country music. Also her ex ""friend"" was probably going to be at the other place bc he still wants her back, she really is that amazing.
  The we get to the bar just before 9 and it's pretty busy already, theres a great atmosphere and pretty much everyone was having a good time. We had a few drinks and danced for about an hour before deciding to head out for a smoke break. We were having an amazing night! Everything was going off perfect  after about 45 mintues of more dancing (I cant so I just kinda lean side to side lol) and a couple more drinks it was time for another cigarette break. When she had finished her cigarette she was ready to go back in but I wanted to take a second and relax a bit first. She obliged and we sat on the bench for another 5 minutes. While sitting there she asked me if I was tired and ready to go, I replied no not at all. We got up and headed back in. As we got into the club we both looked over at the single couple on the dance floor. She looked on at the dance floor looks them up and down and says ""damn... I would love to dance with him"" as the grinded their hips. I said to her that her saying that kinda hurt, she said she just thinks shes a better dancer. After the song the couple left the dance floor and headed separate ways he went to another girl and she I wasnt paying attention to.  After another song he and this new girl headed onto the dancefloor. My girlfriend than began to stare again looking them up and down biting her bottom lip. Is leaned towards her and said ""I think I'm ready to go now"" she looked back upset and said okay. We headed out to the car, once in the car I explained why I was feeling hurt. She rolled her eyes and said ""whatever, let's go"". She then went on to get really upset and angry on the way home. She angrily explained that she just wanted to dance to prove she was the best dancer there and that she didnt even realize it was the same guy. She made me feel bad for feeling hurt and made me feel like my feeling were invalid. This was the first time in our entire relationship that I had actually gotten upset at her and felt hurt by her, now I feel BAD for feeling hurt. We got home and she calmed down pretty quickly and after about a half hour we were kissing and she was trying to have sex. I stopped her from taking my boxers off and explained that I was really emotional and couldn't have sex at that point. This infuriated her.. she immediately rolled over covered up and turned the lights out. I laid next to her and put my arm over her to cuddle her a little and she told me not to touch her. I apologized and rolled back to where I couldnt touch her. After about 20 minutes she was asleep and I was left laying there feeling bad for hurting and being upset with myself for upsetting her even more. All I wanted was for her to have a good night and relax. I ended up falling alseep after a couple hours. This morning I woke up to her coming back from the restroom. I said ""I love you so much, and that I thought she was the most beautiful woman ever. She replied ""do you though?"". She went on to explain that she still upset about last night I dragged her out making her spend as much time getting ready as I did letting her dance. 
  Idk what to do.. I'm writing this as I sit on the floor trying to figure out what do I do??? How do I fix this???? How do I say I'm sorry for making the night worse?? I feel like crap",2019-07-07 12:05:09,12,1,relationship_advice
404,ca63vo,reddittalk3,"I’m annoyed when men in general (and it’s happened with my bf) break their necks to check out other women in front of me, say a celebrity is hot, and watches porn. What is normal for couples to do?","I know that I’m not the most beautiful in the world and that there is always going to be someone else equally or more beautiful than me, but I don’t think it’s okay for a man in a relationship to excessively turn his head to check out when a beautiful woman passes by (especially if she’s dressed slutty). I think it’s disrespectful. I’ve had this convo with other people and couples and some have said, “there’s nothing wrong with looking as long as he comes home to me,” and to be honest, most of these people have cheated on their s/o’s. So, their advice is not credible. 

I think there is a difference between noticing another person is attractive and being grimy and disrespectful. Noticing someone’s beauty can be done within a few seconds, and no big deal should be made of it. But to pivot your head 180 degrees to make sure you don’t miss a second of the moment that one beautiful woman in a skirt is passing by is just excessive and rude. What is the point of the prolonged stare? (Are you planning on asking her out and plan to cheat on me? Do you want spank bank material for later and are trying to accurately record her image in your brain? Are you going to leave me for her?)  

I have also asked women colleagues or friends of mine what they think when their s/o says someone on tv is hot. The common response is, “Well, I know they’ll never meet that person and have a chance with them so I don’t care.” I disagree with this too. So their reason for not getting upset is because there will be no opportunity for their s/o to cheat on them or break up with them for an “upgrade”? This is insane to me. Whether one has a minimal chance or a large chance of meeting someone they think is hot in real life should not be the determining factor in whether someone’s conduct (their glorification of another person in front of their s/o) is okay. 

Now, porn is a huge trigger for me. I get it, people watch it. That is okay. However, I do think once you’re in a relationship, you shouldn’t watch it excessively. I mean you have someone at that point to have sex with! I also think that leaving their porn history out in the open or openly admitting it is just a huge no for me. It’s a major turn off. I don’t get why women are okay with their men having porn folders on their desktop or are okay with them masturbating to it all willy nilly. What about knowing your man is getting turned on and getting off to another woman is a turn on to you? That woman isn’t you. For this reason, I think that if men do it, they should at least do it privately and go to extreme lengths so that their s/o doesn’t find out. I’m not dumb. I know my s/o watches it, but I don’t want to know, and I better never know.

I do want to add that porn has totally screwed up sexual expectations for many in an unhealthy way. Men/women (mostly men) are so used to the angles they see in porn that when it comes to the real deal, they have a hard time getting an erection. Also, the sensation of a man’s hand on their own junk is presumably way different than that of a woman’s vagina and when it comes to the real deal, men that are excessive porn watchers have a hard time getting an erection or getting off because they’re used to the grip of their hand! 

Lastly, I also want to note I am in no way religious at all. I just think people in a couple should put their attention towards each other, both sexually and in other supportive ways. Why glorify another person when you can glorify your man or wife and make them feel like a king or queen and have the best life ever?! 

I know many of you will disagree with my thoughts above and think that I’m too crazy, but I have too many insecurity issues which have been aggravated by some of my s/o’s behavior and I am also very old school even though I’m still young and I like to keep the relationship classy. 

If I am wrong or you disagree, explain to me your thought process on this topic so I can gain a better understanding and maybe I can get over my crazy...expectations.

It’s so hard to find someone these days that is respectful in that they don’t break their neck or glorify other women (celebrity/actress or not) in front of me, and also, someone who is respectful enough to keep their watching of porn videos on the low for the sake of my self-esteem.",2019-07-07 12:02:40,5,0,relationship_advice
405,ca6346,ktlkat,Boy friend swears at me - is it ok?,"My boyfriend has anger management issues that go a long way back. The part that is difficult for me to deal with is that he loses his temper in arguments quick as  lightening, and goes into ranting and shouting and swearing, over stuff that can easily be dealt with calmly. 

It isn’t name calling like calling me bitch or whatever it’s more swearing AT me like “shut the fuck up” “running your fucking mouth” “fuck off”. 

I find this so disrespectful and just don’t see myself being comfortable in a relationship where this is considered ok. Its not just the words, it’s that it comes from a place of hate in that moment.

I told my boyfriend that I was tired but I was okay with him going. He told me he was going to be gone for an hour and then he’d be back. So I go home and he stays out. I trust my boyfriend in the sense that he can go out without me and things are going to be fine. So I stay awake until 1 am waiting for him and fall asleep and then wake up at 4 am and still no boyfriend coming home. I have no texts no missed calls of him telling me he’d be out later or he’s okay. Mind you we don’t live together we don’t see each other every day and live a couple hours apart currently. But that’s minor details. I call him and ask him if he’s okay I’m worried at this point. He replies that he’d be home by 5 am. At this point I’m just a little irked because he told me one thing and then he didn’t hold up to his word. Now because he’s been out all night we can’t go through with our previously made plans. My boyfriend in the past has not been good with time management. Am I being unreasonable for being mad at him ? I feel like it’s a violation in trust in a sense but in another sense I feel like I’m overreacting a bit

Edit :  he came home drunk. I’m sleeping and he wakes me up to lay next to me. I told him that I would have liked for him to check in with me at least just to let me know he’s okay. I also told him that it bothers me when he tells me he’s going to says he’s going to do something and doesn’t follow through with it, it’s called being a man of his word.  I was talking to him in a calm voice. To that he started getting angry with me and starting cussing and yelling. So here we are on different ends of the house and I told him we’d talk when he’s going to be more receptive and sobers up. I didn’t expect him to kiss my ass but not this",2019-07-07 11:52:26,6,1,relationship_advice
409,ca2vnp,emilyh666gan,Should I dump my boyfriend?,"So I’ve been with this guy for a couple months, we’re not in love by any means but he’s definitely the most reliable and emotionally available person I’ve been with which has been a treat. Things started off great and I used to think he’s the only decent person I’ve ever dated. Thing is, sometimes he makes jokes towards me that just crush my self esteem. I can’t really think of all the particular times (except this last one) but I do think being with him is hurting my self worth in a way because I don’t feel like the same Kween I was when we started dating. What’s brought me to the verge of breakup was this conversation we had yesterday on the phone.

So on the Fourth of July I was on my friend’s boat and I texted my boyfriend a hot picture of me in my bikini. I don’t know how this came up over the phone but he said he texted the pic of me to his best friend. I thought that was weird af so I kept asking him why he sent it to his friend. He wouldn’t give me a straight answer and I got this gut feeling that they were making fun of me for some reason. Finally he says “I sent it to [best friend] because he was hungover and needed something to make him throw up,” and started CRACKING UP! I just hung up and haven’t talked to him since.

I don’t know him to be a mean person like this, like he’s usually so sweet and caring and good to me, and yeah we poke fun at each other all the time like normal couples but lately he’s been saying things that aren’t playful and just mean like this that make me think I should just dump his ass too. I still haven’t heard from him and kinda just want to grab my stuff from his place and block him because I listened to Truth Hurts by Lizzo just now and I know for a fact she wouldn’t put up with this tomfoolery!

410,ca60ke,fanofphans,Is it bad that sex isn’t desired?,"Hi Reddit! First time poster here, so recently I (20f) started seeing this guy (21m). We hit it off very well and one thing led to another and we had sex. The sex was good and we’ve engaged a few more times after that.  Fast forward a couple weeks (now), we’re both really happy being in each others company, we’re a couple, stay over at each others places etc.. but we’re not getting “physical” per say . We cuddle, kiss, and get intimate but nothing too sexual. Honestly, I believe we’re both fine with this, we’ve talked about it and agreed we’re both happy. But I’m worried if this comes off as a red flag or not. 
Some factors that I believe might be causing this are: 
- he is very inexperienced with girls, and is still self conscious around me. (We’re working on this)
- My ex forced and always guilted me into sex
- I was sexually assaulted about a year ago (since then I’ve gotten professional help) 
 
I really like this guy and I know he likes me too. 
This coming fall we’ll be about a 3hr flight away from each other due to school and are talking LDR. 
Basically, what I’m asking is: if it’s normal to not want to be sexual with a partner so early in a relationship and it still succeed.",2019-07-07 11:50:02,1,1,relationship_advice

He’s the first dude to really treat me right and I care a lot about him. He’s white, I’m black. When I told my mom about him she hung up in my face and every time I bring him up she tells me to break up with him. Fast forward to yesterday and I went with him and his family to the lake, I had a great time. I called to check in and she told me that he never seems to make an effort to hang with my friends and that he doesn’t really like me because of my race. She kept pushing the breakup thing and told me how disgusted she was with me and him. I put on a brave face, but it hurt. I’m going through a lot right now (finances) and he’s really being supportive and he’s so good to me. It hurts to hear my mom shit on such a good thing.

And when I got home i was on call with a few friends and him and I jokingly go through his phone and I click on one of his Instagram DMs and I read it out of curiosity. Turns out his old mate from his old town had been asking for feet pictures as my SO had recently found out about his foot fetish. My SO had obliged and on multiple times through out their conversation he had sent him pictures of his feet.

Am I allowed to be annoyed or is it just stupid? Like, I feel like I'm being petty and silly for being upset over this but I honestly don't know.

414,ca1kxt,brinykole,I messed up and I don’t know what to do,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for over 3 years, both (20s.) we have had a lot of good times together but we both could do a lot of work on coping with emotions. This is both of ours first, long term relationship (over 1 year.) We have had a lot of arguments but there were a lot of good times. We fit together like puzzle pieces. No abuse. We were stressed together but we were mostly happier than we would have been apart. 

Lately, we moved to a new place. It’s been rough financially and I recently lost my job. It’s been really hard and we got to the lowest point we could get. Questioning if we will ever be happy together again. We took time away in an intended break up, but we are both hurting so badly and just want to be with each other, but he is now hurt by this whole event. Our former roommate (now just his roommate) is toxic. Always was trying to play mind games with us to get us opposing each other. She planted this seed in my head that I deserve better. 

I really need advice on how to get our relationship to grow past this point. We were stuck in a rut of depression. We both want things to work out, but we are afraid we would fall back into these patterns in the future. How can we be mindful of each others love languages and actively keep trying? We can’t afford therapy, we can barely afford rent.

I don’t have anyone to talk to about this and work out my feelings except my parents. I’d rather talk to an outside source without a bias on one side or the other.",2019-07-07 01:54:14,6,5,relationship_advice

418,ca3hc9,FoxxySecret,I(20f) woke up to my autistic cousin(13m) standing over my bed with a knife. What do I do now?,"Basically the title. But, I feel I need to expand on my cousins situation and our relationship and etc. 

So, to begin, I'll say my cousin and I have a little to nonexistent relationship. I don't like kids in general. But, I highly dislike my cousin. I don't make it obvious or anything. 

He had a troubled childhood and is ADHD and sort of recently officially diagnosed as autistic.

Doesn't excuse waking up to him standing over me with a very obvious kitchen knife imo. 

His father is generally absent.  As a recent thing, he's abandoned his son to my brother/other family members  who all live in the family home. 

Why would he do this you may ask? My cousin is in therapy for his autism and had a family therapy session with his stepmom, and dad. 

During the session he said ""I want to kill Susan"" Which is his stepmom, who, already dislikes him and it's incredibly obvious. 

His dad's response instead of admitting him into some more therapy, just abandons him so his wife will be happy for a little longer.  

He doesn't know he's stuck with us just yet. We're hoping when summer ends he will be allowed home. 

I'm not thrilled he's around me a lot more than before, but, I'm respectful about it. Ideally I don't speak to him, I try to make sure he never sees me. 

I accidently took a nap watching a movie, and, I wake up to him standing over me with a knife and he sees I'm awake and sprints down the hall.

I live in a slightly expensive area because it is close to my workplace and I do not want to move far from work as I often spend 10+ hours in the office and I do not want to waste another hour or two because of the commute. When I brought it up with her she told me that she would love to live together but she cannot afford to contribute equally for the rent at any of the locations near my office and she said that she does not want to be a leech. She is now trying to convince me to move to a cheaper place with her which is a little farther away. I would do that happily if not for the commute time. 

I can see where she is coming from but at the same time I really do not care about her not being able to pay - I would happily cover the expenses and I definitely do not think she would be leeching on me if she moves to my place.",2019-07-07 11:32:43,6,1,relationship_advice
420,ca5uvy,wallabyfloo,I think the ex of a friend is into me. How do i handle it?,"Ok, first of all, a bit of backstory. I (23m) have been single for 8 month, and i had a really hard time moving on. I finally managed to get better (on this point at least, i'm clinically depressive) by telling myself i didn't need a relationship, and from this point it became to me totally cool to befriend a girl, no matter how cute she was.
So, i've met this girl, we'll call her Judie, like one month ago. I met my friend, Tom for this time, randomly in a bar. We spent the evening together. I thought about Judie she was beautiful, but as she was with Tom, nothing would happen.
FF to two weeks ago. A good friend of ours (which I met thanks to Tom btw) was having a little party. Judie was there, but not Tom, who was away for his studies. During the party, Judie told how things were bad with her boyfriend, so bad that some people thought they already broke up. At 10pm, everyone left. Judie said she wanted to drink, so I invited her to do so. We drank a bit, and she went further on her relationship with Tom. She seemed to love him, but for her, she was just a distraction to him. Then we spent all night walking around and chatting. 
We saw each other a few time, with other friends, and we exchanged a lot of texts. After a few day, I thought I might be into her, but decided not to tell, for I was happy enough on my own an she already was in a relationship. But she noticed, and tricked me into telling her. When I asked how she felt about this, she gave me a vague answer about how she was in a relationship already, and loved her bf. From this moment on, I kinda lost interest in her as a potential gf and only saw her as a friend.
But they broke up two days ago. Both were in ruin, and I felt bad for both of them. Tom was angry at me as he thought I was trying to seduce Judie (which I was not, at least not intentionally). I asked other friends about this, and they told me the also thought like this...
Now, Judie tells me how she looks forward to see me, that she wanna hug... 

So what could happen? Nothing could of course, and everything would be alright. Both would recover and I could remain friend with both of them. But what if something happens? Here is how I feel. First of all, accept a relationship with Judie could bring me the hate of Tom, as it would confirm his thoughts, and from his friends, who would support him. Second, I could be unhappy in this relationship as she is the kind of girl who tries to slip away from problems, and I am of the kind who confront them. Third, I still think I don't need a relationship right now, even if this could bring me happiness.



So what do you think of this? If she asks me out, should I accept or run away?",2019-07-07 11:29:03,0,1,relationship_advice
421,ca5ukh,KellyAnnewithanE,Should I invite my ex-best friend who ghosted me to my wedding? Should I try to patch up or is it over?,"
We have been friends for eight years, really close for the last 4-5 years. [she=27F, me 26F]. We’ve lived together a couple of times, really loved and cared for each other when we’ve been depressed or in need of help, whether that’s financial, emotional, stranded, etc. She’s really generous and gives everything to her loved ones, including me. But she’s also co-dependent and resentful when things she didn’t ask for aren’t offered or mad when you do offer. So a lot of times there’s been a bit of bitterness or toxicity in our co-dependent relationship, living in each other’s pockets. We have both mental health issues too (anxiety, depression) but largely have been good for each other. 

Last year I got serious in a relationship really quickly and fell pregnant. She was around a lot and kept saying that she was going to steal my baby, that she’ll be a really involved aunt. Then my baby is two months old she disappears. Cancels plans with me with flimsy excuses or lies (which I’ve heard from mutual friends) and then ghosts for two months straight. The whole time I feel like I’ve been through a breakup with no idea what I did wrong. After a few unreturned messages and calls over the months—some serious and questioning and some casual—I finally text her that I love her and that I hope that we can talk again, and that I hope it won’t be too awkward just because of the last two months. And then she finally replies acting as if nothing has been wrong, saying “I thought we were the kind of friends who could go a few weeks without talking? Has it really been two months?” and a non-apology. “I’m sorry you feel that way.” I feel like she gaslighted me after she ghosted me. And since this she’s been really sweet and smarmy if I see her in public but otherwise does not speak to me and will not acknowledge that anything is wrong. 

It’s now been over eight months since we spent time together on purpose or had any actual conversation. It breaks my heart to think that she won’t be at my wedding so I want to invite her, but I think she would only come to save face and that she doesn’t want to be my friend. I would try to patch things up or talk before the wedding to see if we can be friends again but like I said, I had tried lots of times to see her, and she ignored me for months. So I don’t know if I should just let her go, especially since there hasn’t even been a confrontation. This is someone I until November ‘18 considered a sister.

We've started having sex 2 months ago but there were only three times that he actually cum. At first we thought it's because of the condoms (as it turned out he needed a larger size and we ended up buying bigger and bigger ones three times). But now I think they fit fine (although he claims they are not) and he still can't cum. He masturbates when we're apart and often cums when I give him a blowjob but sex just doesn't seem to work despite his claims that it feels great. I am his first and he is my second so neither he, nor I have any idea what to try. Has anyone experienced something similar?

This morning she woke up and we were having light conversation in bed. She was due to leave in an hour or so after breakfast. She said she enjoyed dinner last night but she wanted to address the point about how I don't talk about my feelings. She asked me to tell her how I feel about her. I changed the subject, but she pressed. So I told her I think she's beautiful. She said that wasn't a feeling and she pressed again. I said no and we fell out. We didn't shout or argue or anything but it was awkward for the rest of the time there even when we were eating breakfast.

While she's in the shower I remove the copy of my keys she has to my flat from her key ring. I want space. She comes out and she sees what I've done and I can see she's about to cry but she doesn't say anything. She left in silence and it was the first time she hasn't been happy around me.

It hasn’t always been plain sailing though - we’ve had some issues in the past, and she used to be quite emotionally manipulative and insecure.

Because of this, I used to sometimes lie about what I was doing. Like e.g. I said I was meeting a male friend for coffee but it was actually a female friend, or instead of going for drinks with just the guys it was guys and girls etc. This is because any mention of there being another girl there and she’d go off her nut at me about “oh you must clearly like her more than me” etc, so wasn’t worth the reaction. She also asked me once if I’d kissed a girl I am currently friends with (before I even met my girlfriend) and I said no because it wasn’t worth her reaction, but I actually had kissed that girl once a long time ago.

Fast forward to today, I no longer lie, and she is no longer insecure. Point remains that a long time ago I did lie about some of these things, and feel guilty. At the same time, they aren’t big deals, so probably aren’t worth bringing up. Everything is going well, but I don’t want to feel like I’m “hiding anything”.

429,ca3d1h,Operator-BK201,I think I have a mental illness and I think its harming my relationship.,"Hey guys, I'm 17. My girlfriend is also 17, but were both fairly mature for our age. 
Anyways, I think I have some sort of mental illness of some kind. My brother has schizophrenia, and my sister is a narcissist. Depression, anxiety, and other mental issues run in the family. My grandpa had dementia.
And at one point in time I though I had high-functioning depression because I wasnt in any intense sadness all the time. But I would just suddenly feel depressed to the suicidal point at least once a week. It doesnt help that I also struggle with a porn addiction. 

Since I got into a relationship, for the most part it's been fine. We dont really get in fights, but we sorta have little spats here and there. And I feel like most of them are caused by me. 

Typically, I get irritated or annoyed over simple things. And I have a mood swing in the blink of an eye, over something real stupid. 

Like for example, I went out to eat, was having a conversation with family, and just for one second it felt like everyone was against me. Even if it was just for a second, no matter how stupid, it was enough for me to lose my appetite, and I had a total mood swing. I didnt want to talk, eat, socialize or anything and just generally wanted to lay in bed and stare at the ceiling. 

These small things can immediately change my mood, to a pretty far extreme too. 
I'm also fairly selfish too. I try to not be, but sometimes I am just on impulse. 

I've been diagnosed with ADHD in the past. 
And, I was born 10 weeks prematurely. I dunno how I survived but I did. I have no physical defects or anything. Which was lucky. 

TLDR: I have somewhat frequent (at least 2 a week) mood swings that often happen within a few seconds, and can change my mood drastically. I've been diagnosed with ADHD, my family has a history with depression and anxiety, my grandpa had dementia, my brother has schizophrenia, and my sister is a narcissist. In addition, I was born 10 weeks earlier than my expected due date. I think I have a mental illness that is potentially hurting my relationship.

I’m not the best looking guy around so that’s another thing that really makes me feel insecure that she’s gonna find a better looking guy and leave me for him idk maybe I’m just acting to immature about it but if someone wants to discuss it further just leave a comment,2019-07-07 07:24:46,1,2,relationship_advice
432,ca5q5f,keanuleaves22,Can you form a connection to someone through text?,"So I matched with a girl on tinder and we literally texted for months. I got to know about her life pretty well through texting her pretty much every single day and occasionally sending pictures. I couldn’t get home to go on a date with her so that’s why it took so long. But she always wanted to and kept asking me pretty much weekly.

Eventually I did go on a date with her. The dates seemed like they went absolutely perfectly. We got very intimate from the first date, slept together, she told me about all her problems and life goals, everything. We only properly dated for 2 months but eventually it turned out she was a very narcissistic, self centred and honestly pretty emotionally abusive person. 

But getting onto the main point, this relationship really quite broke me mentally. It’s been 3 months and I’m still extremely depressed and anxious all the time. Even been going to therapy for it. But I’m very confused how such a short period could do this to me. 
So just wondering if you can form a connection through texting and sending pictures and stuff like that. Because if you can then this makes the whole thing more understandable to me as it means it actually went on for 7 months rather than just 2. 

Any thoughts? Cheers",2019-07-07 11:10:04,4,1,relationship_advice
433,ca5pzo,SojkaDavid,My GF told me she’s not happy after 3.5Y of “happy” relationship,"I’ve been dating my first GF since I was 18 (she was 16) and now I am 22 and she told me she is not happy. She believes that the reason is that she has changed a lot and doesn’t recognize herself anymore. She used to make me jealous in the early stage of our relationship with her guy-friends. And when I confronted her about that, she started to remove them from her life. Now she feels like she missed a lot of experiences.

There were also other minor problems (e.g. too few activities or she felt bad because every time she did something, I did it better - her words), but this seems to be the big one. And current state?

We have been together through good and bad and this situation seems like a typical crisis of any relationship (I had it too). We decided to stay together but she needs to realize if she wants to stay or go. But it’s driving me crazy that every time I touch her, she is completely cold-hearted (doesn’t hug back, doesn’t kiss back, doesn’t call me sweet nicknames...). When I ask her if she’s comfortable when I touch her, she “doesn’t know”. It’s been 2 weeks and she can’t tell whether it’s better or not. Her emotions are like gone and she sees all the memories dark. Through the day we are like best friends and during nights we are like strangers - I used to hug her for like 30 mins before every sleep and after every wake up, now nothing (not even a good night kiss). I cannot imagine that her heart will belong to someone else, but it’s slowly killing mine. But to the question...

How long should I wait? Should I stay and fight or let her go? Do you have experience with the same thing / what did you do? How can I not make a wrong move? I really love her and I know she used to truly love me. I see a chance, but it hurts every minute, hour, day,...",2019-07-07 11:09:26,4,1,relationship_advice
434,ca5plt,toxic_squi_d,I (F 23) am having irrational thoughts about my boyfriend (M 24) cheating on me,"I (F 23) have a boyfriend (M 24) and we are in a two years long relationship. Everything is going great, he is actually someone I could imagine my life with.

But in last few months I started having irrational thoughts about him cheating on me. He has never done anything that made me have these thoughts but anyway I have them from time to time. When I am out of the city or at the job or anywhere, I just start imagining scenarios without even realizing and then it just goes on and on until I feel really bad and start believing that maybe it is actually true. 

Before this relationship I had a relationship that lasted for year and a half and that boyfriend had cheated on me a couple times. I think that maybe I have some kind of PTSD and that it is the cause of the thoughts I have about my current relationship. I am actually very sensitive about this theme and since I have been cheated on I feel really bad even when I see it in movies or read about it. But I am confused because these thoughts started happening just a few months ago and not at the beginning of my current relationship. 

I have talked to my boyfriend about this a couple times and he understands me and tells me there is nothing to worry about and that he loves me. I actually know that he isn't doing anything and I have confidence in what he says and after these conversations I feel better.

I wouldn't like to ruin a relationship with person I truly love and happiness we have because of some irrational thoughts that have nothing to do with reality but I don't know what should I do about this?

TLDR: I have thoughts about my boyfriend cheating on me but he has never done anything to make me think that.",2019-07-07 11:07:55,8,1,relationship_advice

She has nipped/bitten me twice now. So, I have a slight fear of her at night. It makes it hard for me sleep over or rest easy. He keeps getting upset to me for the fear and wants me to chill so she gets use to me.

437,ca5mls,c_alvi,My strict religious mother and spoiled little sister...,"I don’t have anywhere to go to vent. I always feel like no one listens to me so maybe putting myself out here will make me feel better. 
I’m 22 years old and I just graduated college. I already have my “big girl” job. As I got older, I realized how messed up I am from being raised with a strict, catholic mom and spoiled little sister who is about to be 20 next month. My mom has raised me to do things always her way. I grew up being shamed for wanting to wear shorts (shorts for goodness sakes) or any clothing that God forbid would be inappropriate and provocative. I live in Texas and I wear jeans because I can’t bring myself to wear shorts without hearing my mom judge me about how I’m making other men sin. However, my younger sister gets away with it. I can’t even wear tight workout capris without being yelled at that I need to wear a long and big T-shirt to cover my behind since they’re “so tight”. My sister instigates and even joins in on the yelling how I’m disgusting, even though she does the same thing all the time. Clothing is just one issue in my life here at home. Because of this, even when I went away for college, I felt so insecure and uncomfortable wearing things I was shamed for at home. I’m getting tired of being so unhappy with my family and spoiled sister. My sister is vegetarian so whenever we go grocery shopping, all we do as a family is focus on what my sister can and would like to eat. It can be quite expensive at times.  No one ever asks me in my family if there’s something I want or like. It’s always about her. Even when I would come home from college, mom would make meals that she liked versus my favorite meals. I always feel like I’m living in my younger sisters shadow as I’m quiet and not so crazy as she is. I’ve been dating the love of my life for about 6 years now and he gets brought down too by the way my family has been so strict on me and us. (We aren’t allowed to go on trips together, which is something he really wants to go to. We also can’t move in together as I have to get married first.) I know he loves me and he waited for me to finish college, but it doesn’t seem like I’ll be getting a proposal soon since he says he doesn’t want to give in to what my mom wants, for me to get married before moving in together. I think it’s gotten to him too. I know my life, his life, and our relationship would be better if we decide to marry and just be together. I would be able to be away from all the negativity in my home that’s just eating me away. What should I do? If anyone has any ideas... I’m just so tired and so sad.",2019-07-07 10:55:59,14,0,relationship_advice

439,ca450v,jeterapresadvice,"While drunk, I may have confessed a crush to my [19 F] cousin's [20 F] brother","I[19F] got incredibly wasted last night, and added all my cousins from a group chat onto my personal snapchat account as friends. An hour later I realized my cousin's brother TJ[17M] had unfriended me. I have a crush on my cousin, Angela [20F]. It's important to note that they are my cousins because of my brother's marriage to their cousin, but they consider me family. I have no idea if I said something, but I'm 90% sure I said nothing to him, as we don't really talk anyways.

This morning, I talked to two of my other cousins, and they said that this behaviour was odd on TJ's part, which led me to believe I had said something about being attracted to his sister. One of my cousins messaged him asking what's up, and he left her on read. I had to explain the circumstances to this cousin in particular, and she was relatively cool about it, and assured me she has my back and will not incriminate me.


I realize I probably should not have said anything in the first place and let it blow over, but I have no idea of how to move on. I don't talk to anyone from that group much, except for the two cousins I told, and I'm still on the group chat on Snapchat?

441,ca444p,Bopeep7813,"Tl;Dr: Roommate (Male, 24) of Boyfriend (Male, 25) and I (Female, 22) groped me, s/o is trying to avoid the conflict, and I am scared to be home and feel betrayed by lack of prioritizing of s/o in this scenario"," Just this month I moved in with my boyfriend of over four years. My s/o owns a house and rents out the extra bedrooms to his friends; all of which I don't know very well due to their antisocial nature, but have historically never had a problem with. We only have one roommate left, and this particular one is far more closed off than the other's were along with having some interesting tendencies. This roommate, who I will be referring to as ""Tom"" from now on, has had some previous issues with self destructive behavior and respecting privacy, such as breaking into the other house member's PC's and reading their messages to see if discussing anything regarding him, watching them sleep at night, going through their stuff, etc.
 A few nights ago Tom came into me and my s/o's bedroom at 12AM while we slept and said ""I think I'm going crazy."" My s/o went upstairs with him to talk, but upon getting up there Tom immediately decided to go to bed leaving us clueless. The situation made me worried, so after talking to my s/o I decided to go talk to him to make sure he was okay the next day. Turned out he was at work the whole day, so me being busy myself, I decided to leave a note saying he could talk to me if he ever needed anything alone with some comfort candy. The following night (4th of July) he came out of his room and started talking to me and ended up inviting me to see fireworks with him. The whole while he stood really close to me and kept following me everywhere (even to my bedroom when I told him I was gonna change into warmer clothes), so I went and grabbed my s/o to join us since I was starting to feel a bit uneasy.
 While the three of us sat on the roof to watch fireworks, me sitting in the middle, I kept feeling something touching my lower back and butt. For the first bit I tried to just assume it was an accident and scooted away from Tom. He stopped for a minute to tell my boyfriend what a great friend he was, but a moment later he was full on grabbing my butt. I whipped my head over and said ""Don't touch me"".  He told me not to play stupid in return. Mind you, my s/o was sitting right next to us, but he couldn't hear what we were saying past the fireworks. I got really scared he might act erratically on the roof, so I kept it low with the plan to talk to my s/o when we went to bed. 
30 mins later Tom pushed me into getting him a b-day cake, and me being confused and kind of scared by his unpredictable behavior agreed. My boyfriend last second decided to stay home, so I pushed through thinking there couldn't be much that happened while I drove just going to the store... Stupid move. On the drive he stated he purposely grabbed me and admitted he had a very strong sexual attraction to me then asking if I was interested. I tried to tastefully let him know I wasn't interested in him at all and am very committed to my s/o, but he continued to reiterate his interest in me and reading if I was interested in him. When we got back to the house from the store he finally said sorry and played stupid telling me to let him know when he's doing something bad, but again stated after he's attracted to me and once again asked if I was sure I wasn't interested. Tom is extremely intelligent and without a doubt knows better, so I have no doubt in my mind he is just being manipulative given I tend to be something of a jokester and play dumb to things a lot just because I think it's funny. 
Well, the night ended fine with Tom not making any more prerogative moves, but upon getting to bed and telling my s/o everything, he ended up just getting cold toward me and shutting down. My s/o hates conflict and will do just about anything to avoid it, so he has pretty much been spending the whole time deciding whether or not he should do something about it, and I'm pretty sure he's sorta in denial and doesn't really understand the gravity of what happened (maybe). He told me he thinks Tom is just acting out to start trouble. I feel terrible my s/o has to deal with this conflict and is coming from a long time 8 yr. friend, but I also have dealt with a very serious personal assault case that has left me with permanent injuries before that I do not want repeated, so I can't help but to feel scared of this current situation given how unapologetically he acted that night With my boyfriend around, so the thought of what he might do while I'm alone terrifies me. As unfair as it may be after telling my s/o he doesn't have to take action this time, I am angry with him since his lack of involvement and insistence on trying to stay impartial makes me believe he is prioritizing a toxic friendship and stance of neutrality over my well being and possible safety. 
I am angry, scared, and confused; and at this point I'm avoiding being home and not sure who to talk to about it, so here I am... Everything I do feels too emotionally driven right now, and I am having a hard time finding a logical solution that is fair to my s/o and I. I want Tom out of the house, but it is not my house and doesn't feel like my place to ask for... Any advice on how to confront this issue as a whole? Thank you to everyone and anyone who reads this all and takes the time to help me and my dilemma, I really appreciate it.

442,ca43dv,friend_away,A very close friend is going through something harsh and sudden and I don't know know how to talk to him.,"Throwaway account. Question at the bottom.

TL;DR: parents of friend's date saw them together, turned out to be fucking psychotic and a really chill guy is now distraught. How do I and another close friend in the circle help him without being too interfering?

So I've been friends with these two people for the past two years, and they'd known each other for a long time before. I've become very good friends with the two over the two years, one of those ""we'll probably be friends for life"" kind. 

So the one concerned is very calm, very mature, doesn't pick quarrels with anyone; just overall a friendly and based person. A week or so ago a girl in school asked him out on what could hardly be considered a date, they're both happy and really mature about it (we're all16/17). Yesterday he took her home to introduce her to his family and vice-versa. They're nothing serious at all, like I mentioned they've only been on one date if that. Everything went great, and afterwards she wanted to walk back home since she stayed nearby and he insisted that he drop her home. On their way (they're on a motorcycle, she's driving) her parents see her, and turns out they're fucking psychotic. I won't go into the details but they badmouth the friend and later we find out they hit her after it was all over. A lot more ensued and the families were involved. I'll spare you the details. 

So an overall happy and calm guy is now disturbed and after I messaged him asking him if we was okay he said he was fine but his brother tells us he's still down. Like he's slowly going into a depressive episode.

This is all information he confided in me so I'm not a third-party trying to squeeze in. I'm technically breaking his confidence by posting it and I'm a POS, I have no excuse.

To what extent can I interact with him without being a bother? The other friend, the guy's brother, and I want to take him to a park or something so he could relax and deal with his emotions but I really have no fucking clue how to approach him (not irl but through ig, seems he won't be coming to school for a few days).

This happens less than 5 years ago, back then I was at my hometown and she was oversea studying her degree. I texted her everyday and we talk and talk and talk for roughly like half a year. Then, out of nowhere without any some sort of explanation, she ghosted me, doesnt replied and doesnt read, nothing. I panicked and well she told me : "" I have no feelings for you and you were bothering me. "" And I replied: ""Sorry""
(as a way to apologizing to her, for all this time that I have bothering her)

But. The story doesn't stop there.

3 Months later, she out of nowhere trying to initiate a conversation with me which of course me and my best friend confirmed that I should give her a cold shoulder for what she had done. (and seriously who tf does that, acting like nothing happened). End of Story. No more texting.

But. Hold Up. Story doesn't end there.

ALL OF HER FRIENDS accused of me breaking up with her. Somewhat my cousins knew about this (I don't know how detail do they knew but I assume that I was trying to get closure to her and that's it). It is just f-ing uncomfortable that everyone that knows her and ""me"" talks about it every time I was there

She sometime posted her stories about ""relationship stuffs, like quotes or advices"" (back then, a few months after the 3 months) and rn if she is around with her friends, she will just compare and talk shit about me (that is not true)

I met her at her workplace and it took us 1month to talk to each other(but we knew we where interest in each other) and one time i asked her out, both took time to know each other before starting a real relationship and it took us 3months. Everything was fine till one day we wanted to make a weekend couch/movie ""party"" just both of us (we both smoke every other day) and so we went to get our stach, she told me she knows a guy (lets call im D) and i was fine with it (we can grow but its not to legal to buy somehow). We got to the parking lot and waited for D, he got there and my gf got out of the car to his car window and came back, she got on the car and told me: ""he i always asking me out even if i tell im seeing somone else"" and i just said its weird. One month after we got the same thing and the same shit happened. She got in the car telling me he asked her out again. And there i told here i was uncomfortable with this and she seemed to understand till the 3time i told her just to get the stach and to not talk to him, just give the money and grab the thing and we go. But she didnt, she stayed there to talk to him for 5min and when she came back i ask why she didnt do as i said and she starded saying how its rude to just not responde to someone and shit like this, and im the one imature for not trusting her, and that they where friends from school before. 
I already been hurt in my last relationships and i need to work on myself to build the trust but not in that situation, so i told her to delete and block him, we got into a fight again on how im immature and i felt more hurt that she kept going until she said she deleted him just to find 3 days after that she didnt. I was hurt not by the fact that she had the guys phone number since it was for stach but more because she told she had deleted him when she didn't. She really never apologized either. And forward on to now, i have trouble that she give her coworker her snapchat and i told her that but its like im the one not trusting her. But every time they call her after work hour she never respond and then whats the point then of giving the number. I really dont know how to feel about this. I trust her in the way she will never cheat on me but its more like attention wise, its like for her its disrespectful to just ditch people.

447,c9yddn,ff8wasthebestone,How long do I (27M) wait for my gf (20F) to make changes before I need to break up with her?,"Hi everyone. This is my first relation advice post, so sorry in advance if my form is poor. This may sound like a rant, but I promise everything I mention is to provide a complete picture of our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been in an okay-to-good, serious relationship for the past 8 months. My girlfriend is an amazing person. She is kind, intelligent, ambitious, hard-working, encouraging, beautiful, and we have similar interests and family backgrounds (crap). Although she is significantly younger than me, she is just about the only 20y/o I would date. I treat her as an equal despite our age gap. But for the lovely person that she is, I find her to be just an okay girlfriend in the sense that she has not learned that effort is the currency of love--not feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

I constantly find myself putting more effort into the relationship than she is. I do little things for her like randomly showing up to her doorstep with her favorite stack late at night after she gets some bad news. She carries out little acts of love as well, but not nearly as much. Honestly, I've kind of stopped doing this sort of stuff. It just feels forced now, like the last love letter I wrote her upon request.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I pay for 90% of our outings/vacations with my programmer salary, she gets upset at the rare times when she does pay. The way it works is: if we go out, its a date. If it's a date, then the guy pays. She is a feminist btw. Her lack of generosity is troubling since if we move in together, I will be paying the bills. If we get married, her student debt will take out a nice chunk of my savings. But, at least she's frugal.

&amp;#x200B;

In the bedroom, I do 90% of the pleasing.  I make it a point to please her every night even though I could easily just make the sex last 3 minutes. When she touches me, it's for a few seconds. She's given me one orgasm to date. While having sex, a few nights ago, I realized that she didn't touch me at all. I felt nausea. I felt hurt. I felt anger. I had sex with her anyways.  We once shared what our favorite part of making love to each other was. She said ""when you f me hard."" I said ""when I make you cum."" She blames it on inexperience, but I remember being a pleaser right out of the gate. I was focused on it even on the night I lost my virginity. I look to the internet for tips, tricks, techniques. I ask her what feels good to her. I try to show her how to please be, but she honestly isn't too enthusiastic. She finds it weird to seek help for sex.

&amp;#x200B;

When I apologize, I put myself in her shoes. I acknowledge how my actions made her feel, or potentially made her feel. When she apologizes, she just says ""sorry"" and sometimes cries. I have to explain to her why she's sorry. It feels like apologizing to myself on her behalf. After fights, I let bygones be bygones. I make it a point to see her soon after and set things back on track. She gives me the silent treatment (sometimes).

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to making plans, I am a perfectionist. She is a flake. She often initiates plans to spend time after work, but then cancels last second because she got off late and feels tired. On such nights, I keep my schedule open just to suffer disappointment after disappointment, while I could have been with friends, or pursuing hobbies.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't blame my girlfriend for her behavior. This is her first serious relationship. I can say for a certainty that it took A LOT of dating to learn how to be a good partner. In fact, I've been the bad boyfriend for an A+ girlfriend. I've been the A+ boyfriend to an AWFUL girlfriend. Now I want to be an A+ boyfriend for an A+ girlfriend. My current girlfriend... well I'd give her a C.

I've communicated all of this to her many times in many ways, be it a discussion, letter, text, telepathy (ok not really). A few nights ago we had a deep talk where I shared why I wasn't as happy as I want to be in the relationship-- that I am constantly left wanting. She assured me that she wants to be the best partner that she can be. She invited herself to stay over, making me feel fully loved for once. She made plans for us to hang out the next day (4th of july), even if she gets off late.

&amp;#x200B;

And then she flakes at the last second after I left my friends party early, citing that she was too tired and had to work in the morning, but that she wanted to at least talk on the phone. Long story short, I caught her lying about being at home. She admitted that she went to a friends party to shoot some fireworks, but that she thought I would be mad. This is doubly suspicious given that we've had a few conversations where I expressed interest in meeting her friends. Now I wonder how many times she flaked on me for other plans. I don't think she's cheating on me, but who knows. Smarter people than me have been cheated on before. The bigger issue is that instead of actually improving her behavior like she promised, she continues to do the same shit, and lying to cover it up. That night, I told her that we should take some time off. She freaked out. I told her I needed some space to re-evaluate the relationship, but that's only part of the truth. I also did it to show her that my commitment is not without condition-- that I am willing to leave her. I refuse to lose self-respect for the sake of love.

&amp;#x200B;

So I mainly have 3 questions at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

1. How should I handle the lying situation? Am I concerned enough?
2. Is there anything more I can do to on my end?
3. If I've exhausted all options, when is it right to break up with her (ex: break up if she doesn't make significant improvement by X day)

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading. I know it was long. I'll check on responses later tonight

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Okay so, the consensus is to break up because I'm miserable. The thing is, the relationship is mostly good for up to months at a time. Usually when an incident comes up, I move quickly to address it and we are floating on a cloud until the next episode. A lot of the issues I mentioned don't happen all at once, all the time. It's more like, she works on improving one thing but slips up in another area. I don't feel unloved. I feel 50% loved from the way she tries to express it (telling me how much she loves me, talking about what we will be like as old people, showing genuine pain at the thought of breaking up). The 50% that is missing comes from her actions.

That being said, I am meeting with her today. If she has little to say and doesn't own up to her actions , then it's over. If she acknowledges her shortcomings and gives concrete ways to improve, then I'm going to give her one more chance. I know that sounds like a super weak move, but I want to give it one more shot before quitting. I understand fully that people don't change for other people, but the things she needs to change are manageable. There's a chance that if presented with a serious consequence for once, she will get her act together. I'll keep you guys posted. Thank you so much for all the input.",2019-07-06 20:40:07,27,14,relationship_advice

449,ca5ght,InherentFrequencies,I (20M) Told The Girl (19F) I was With That She Shouldn't Be With Me...,"I met this girl on a dating app, we talked for a while and I decided to ask her to hang out sometime, and she agreed it would be a good idea. Fast forward to two days ago, I invited her to a fourth of July party at my friend's house. She showed up with one of her friends. We hit it off at first, and we kissed a few times, leading to full on making out. We were both drunk, and she asked me to come back to her apartment. We both had gotten up to leave, when her friend sees us and asks if we wanted to get food. Another guy at the party overhears us and says that he was just about to leave to get food, we should join him. Me and the girl I was with both agree and we head out, and the girl I was with starts making conversation with the guy. Lo and behold it turns out they grew up in the same neighborhood, also wanted to mention she is a Latina, and him being Mexican they hit it off much better than myself and her, with me being Indian. They were talking in Spanish, discussing their childhoods, and when we got to the restaurant as a foursome, I caught her looking at him sometimes. Eventually we got food, and with me having work at 9 AM, I told her I was ubering back, and she said she was as well with her friend. Hers arrives first, she waves bye to me and I had a feeling I was never going to see her again, as she had exchanged contact information with the other guy before leaving (we all shared contact info between the four of us). I took my ride home feeling rejected, when I get a text from her saying she had fun and if I wanted to hang out Friday. I was a bit taken aback as I felt the night hadn't ended well, but I agreed. Fast forward, we go on an actual date walking around the city, and eventually had sex at my apartment. Throughout the entire day I hadn't felt that spark that I thought I should have, and I remember watching the way she had talked with the other guy didn't even live up to a second of conversation we ever had. Being my drunk, confessional self I told her about my feelings and she was taken aback. Then I asked her if I was wrong, didn't she feel the same way? She said she did feel it last night with him, but she was with me and it would've been rude to just leave me. I told her that I could never be as good to her or work out with her the way he and her did, and told her to contact him in the morning or to flirt with him, and to forget me. We both feel asleep, and I woke up she was gone, and I secretly hope she took my advice. AITA?",2019-07-07 10:30:57,1,1,relationship_advice

I've met this girl a while ago and we're getting along really well. Like really well. At some point I just told her, that i really like her and luckily she likes me back. We haven't really going out, but met as often as possible and spend as much time together as possible. We have a lot of shared interests and we're able to comunicate very well with each other. But there is one HUGE problem. I'm moving about 600km across the country to go to college. This was all planed well before we met and I have to go as it would be stupid to give up my education. We both know that. We talked a lot about what todo and agreed, that I will have to focus on college and she has to focus on highschool. Our initial thought was, that it would be best to only keep in touch very briefly. Like chatting, calling or writing a letter only a few times a month and only as friends, so we could concentrate on the rest of our lives and then figure out the rest once she leaves hs. We agreed to meet up a few times and then going on a hiking trip together next year after she finishes hs. The problem is that I have some serious doubts about this Idea, mostly because I don't want to loose the contact to her. We also both don't want a long distance relationship, as this would only encourage me driving back home almost every weekend and that would not be very benefitial. I think my ultimate question boils down to wether or not we should keep in contact as we both want to somehow make this work and don't fuck anything up. We definitly want to be together at some point but I'm unsure it'll work out the intended way.
What the fuck should I do now?

453,ca5frs,ilikecocktails,"Split up 8 months ago, can’t stop crying and feel confused, is this ‘normal’?","I am 29F and he is 31M we were together 4.5 years and I ended it in November last year. I was unhappy, our communication was awful, there were trust issues and I had wanted out for months before. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I suddenly feel sad and teary a lot of the time. It was my decision to split, he has still been trying to get in contact even up until two weeks ago in hopes that we can sort things out.

It was his sister’s wedding aboard last week and I’m still ‘friends’ with his brother on social media and I was just flicking through insta stories and his brother popped up with vids of my ex and my ex’s son all there together and it’s the first time in months that I had actually seen him. And I just cried and cried and cried.

When we split I was ok. Of course it was upsetting but I felt guilty more because of how upset I had made him by choosing to end it. But since then I’ve been ok, not really thinking much of it I’ve moved on with my life and my career since then, have a great lifestyle with friends etc.

My mom thought it was weird that I didn’t seem ‘bothered’ after so long of being together.

He texts me every so often but I never reply. I went to look on his social media and he’s deleted every picture of us together. Which is ridiculous of me to be upset as we aren’t together and haven’t spoken in months and he’s getting on with his life, I have no right to be upset it’s none of my business anymore whatever he does. So I don’t know why I felt so upset and have done ever since.

Never felt this before after a break up my head feels so confused I’m trying to hardest daily to remind myself of all the bad things that happened before and reasons what made me miserable in the first place.

Am I sad because I’m still in love with him or is it that I’m actually now only grieving for my relationship? I’ve unfollowed him and all is family now online so I can’t anything anymore.

This is just a really really strange feeling, is this normal and the kind of thing everyone experiences at some point?

My girlfriend and I have been together for 2 years. I care about her a lot and I love her and I wanna help her bc I’m worried tbh 

She has an exam she has to take and she should be studying for it but instead, she’s developed some sort of addiction to porn and sex. If I notice she’s playing on her phone, I’ll tell her that she has to study and stop playing around and then I’ll leave and come back and she’s watching porn and she says she’s horny and wants to have sex. We have sex 3 times a day. It’s every time she has to study she just distracts herself. Even if I tell her no, I’m not having sex with you, go study. She watches porn and masturbates. And she says “I was just horny and distracted and that was the last time, I’m gonna buckle down and get to work now” and then she doesn’t do it. It’s been one month. 

Then at night, she gets so motivated and says “tomorrow I’m gonna study 3 chapters, I’m gonna wake up and have breakfast and start studying right away” and that never happens. What is going on. She’s watching weird porn and having sex and masturbating. She also gets mad at me if I remind her to study. Ok sometimes Im a hard ass and I yell at her and then she gives me an attitude and says “leave me alone, I don’t feel like studying now if you’re acting like that, it’s my life”. But sometimes she gets anxious and says her exam is coming up soon and she has barely studied and that she can’t focus and she starts crying.

We had our moments of disagreements but talked it out and moved on.

Until I mentioned wanting to eventually (not immediately) meet his parents and bff. That's when he told me that it wasn't necessary and he didn't think it was important that I did. I was a bit shocked since family is very important to me and him refusing a meeting between me and them was a blow to the guts.

He explained that it was a cultural thing, that unless it was super serious, borderline wedding serious, people in his culture didn't meet the parents/family. 
I asked about his bestfriend since they're like brothers and he said that our relationship wasn't his bff's business and that he never met the bff'# girlfriend even after a year of dating.

I don't know what to believe...I really adore him but I feel like an outsider in his life and whenever he talks to his bff on the phone around me they talk in a language I don't understand so I can't be sure that he translate the real thing to me afterward. I don't even know if his bff his aware that I'm his girlfriend and not just a girl he's shagging.

I started feeling really good about myself. 

But, 

Due to losing weight I've kinda lost my butt and boobs unfortunately. He makes fun of how flat my butt is, and when I show any sign of being upset (I try to conceal as best as I can) he says ""well if I were unhappy with myself I'd change it"" which is fair, which I am doing by watching my diet and starting to work out, 

Not only does he make these ""jokes"" about my pancake ass, he also follows a lot of lewd cosplay insta models, which I guess doesn't bother me, he's been single forever and that's just what he's used to, but he screenshots and saves them. He has hundreds if not thousands of them (I only know because I see in his pictures when he's showing me a picture in his phone, I'd never Snoop in his phone) and I hear and see him screenshot every picture of every girl, even if it isn't lewd, it's just selfies of pretty girls, when he's right next to me

If I ask the opinion of other women they'd say the usual ""I'd kill him!!"" Or whatever, but I don't want to be like that, am I'm not, but I'm still a little upset. 

The point is, am I being insecure? Is this normal? (Mostly looking for male input)

He compliments me every once in a while, but I never get the same reaction as he gives to the pictures of girls he sees on the internet. 

I don't want to be the crazy insecure girlfriend, so I'll poke jokes once in a while about his ""addiction"" to saving pictures but we've never fought about it because I don't want to fight about it. What do I do? Do I say anything if it's hurting me? But I don't want it to hurt me, I want to be okay with it.

Sorry if my grammar and story telling sucks too. Feel free to correct me on it, I feel that my emotional crazy writing will cause me to have a lot of mistakes. 

So I’m currently in a relationship in which I feel that the person and I are crazy in love with each other. We would do everything together when the relationship started, but I feel that the honeymoon stage has ended. That is not to say we do not still have TONS of fun together. One thing about my girl though is that she has been screwed over and cheated on a few times before and she has insecurity issues because of that, but I am willing to be patient with her, because I love her. 

The discussion at hand is to not have social, importantly social media in this case, interaction with people I had crushes on, find attractive, or that post sexual photos. To me the problem is that I grew up and went to school with a lot of these people, so over time we became friends and I do not feel attracted to them, since I am in love with my girlfriend. However, she sees these connections as possible threats to our relationship or ways for me to cheat, even if I don’t realize. 

Her agreement is that because she is my girlfriend and I am not very close to some of these people any more, I should unfollow them. At the end of the day she will be with me, and I will most likely not come in contact with these people. 

However, I feel that unfollowing these people is wrong because in today’s age it is a sign of friendship and unfollowing them will mean that something is wrong with the person in my view. I do not want to do that because they have done me no wrong and I want to keep a connection to those people I grew up with. Also I can not control with post slightly sexual content, I do not follow those people for that, I simply follow them because I know them. Keep in mind I do not follow people I don’t know, especially including any Instagram models. Also I feel that if I do unfollow people it would be against how I was raised in treating people I know equally and being friendly. 

If anyone has any questions on elaborating please ask, there might be something I missed. I do not think I have my girlfriend’s stance true justice since I’m writing in a rush, but if you guys want me to slow down and try to break down what she says more closely I can do that. I really think I need a new perspective on this issue because I feel like neither of us understand each other and I want to save my relationship no matter what while keeping my morals in place.

We are both aware our relationship is likely ending soon due to school and life. It was inevitable, and it sucks, but thats how it turned out. We are still together at the moment.

My girlfriend has a very close friend who has recently broken up with her boyfriend and she is wanting to explore more. I know she finds me attractive because early on in my relationship with my girlfriend, she was one of the ones who was jealous of her for getting me. I also know this girl has had a threesome with her last boyfriend before so it is in the realm of possibility.

Also, my girlfriend has also expressed her curiosity in girls but only sometimes, and cryptically. On paper, my girlfriend says she wants me and only me. She was also a virgin when I met her, so there is that level of connection as well, which could either work for or against me.

Realistically, what is the best way to approach this? I don't want to hurt my girlfriend's feelings. I don't want to outright ask her to have a threesome, thats rude and impolite. This sounds primitive but I really desire this, and I know her friend is attracted to me. My girlfriend also has a track record of doing things she says she never wants to do (sex, smoking weed, backpacking, travelling). I want to bring it up in a nice way that wont provoke a bad response. So far the most I have done is joke about it, and she usually rolls her eyes and I can't gauge her reaction.

Then I made the mistake of taking the kids to Walmart with me to get them some food while their dad was at work. They had no food other than food that was at least two years past the expiration date. While I was there, the kids saw a couple that they knew and said hi to them. Turns out that the couple were best friends with their mother. They obviously let her know. I got the kids home and had to get out of dodge, so I didn’t have time to get my stuff from the house. 

Later that day, my bf calls me and lets me know that his ex had stolen my genuine leather cowgirl boots that were hidden in the closet. I obviously called the police since they were worth over $200 and one of my most prized possessions. She had also ruined my Xbox one controller that was less than a month old and my headset. She returned the boots within twenty four hours, so I couldn’t charge her with theft, but while I was picking them up from his house, she was shouting slurs at me for the entire five minutes that I was there. This was about a month ago. 
About two weeks ago, my boyfriend had to put me on speaker and have me say that he and I are just friends because she was blackmailing him and the kids by threatening to take away the internet, car, electricity, etc. 

Ever since that day two weeks ago, I have had very limited amount of contact with him and she has been continuously trying to convince him to sleep with her. I am not worried about him sleeping with her since he is obviously not attracted to her in the slightest. I’m just getting extremely emotionally exhausted. I don’t want to give up on this relationship because I really really like this guy to the point that I might be falling in love with him, but I’m also being emotionally torn to shreds by his ex. Example: I am feeling super ill today and have tried multiple times to get ahold of him but he has to literally block my number whenever he is around his ex because they are selling their house. He hasn’t called me or texted me at all today or yesterday.... I just don’t know if I can take this any longer... please help me figure out ways to hold on longer?",2019-07-07 06:03:05,18,2,relationship_advice

So I've been with my beautiful girlfriend for 2 years now. We have a strong connection like no other. I mean like we are best friends and almost mirror reflections of each other. But
Abyways to the point of the story... 

She has a really close guy friend since childhood. 14 (she's 20 now)  who's been VERY interested in her since they met. But she's never seem him that way and thinks he's kinda well, ugly and not her type. (he's asked her out and she's rejected him and what not) only sees him as like a brother. But anyways I'm cool with her having friends. I'm not a controlling type... Till one drunken night he was telling me how much he loves her and cares for her. Which is cool, friends love and care for eachother. The conversation went something like this
Jamesy- Manmm I love her so much and would kill her Ex if saw him(gf's Ex used to abuse my girlfriend mentally and physically).
Me- yea man after all she is my girlfriend and fuckin love her to bits!! ' here I am trynna hint at him that she's mine)
Jamesy-  Na your JJST the type to agree with what everyone says even if it's not true...

I was like okay maybe his just drunk and talking shut. But ever since then I've got the worse vibe and hes always trynna get her drunk and do drugs which she's been sober for years and HATES alcohol and drugs.
It's like cmon man take the hint she doesn't like you and never did... 
So yes here I am. I need advice on how to tell this mothefucker to lay off without ruining her friends hip with him. Or is that a good thing?  Should I tell him to fuck off

PS. Jamesy has a girlfriend of two years and is always trynna hug my girlfriend when his is not looking and like always goes on about how much he loved my girlfriend when drunk. And it's awkward as Fuck for everyone. And to tell ya the truth I reckon he hasn't moved on and j don't wanna have to smack the cunt out if he keeps getting close to her",2019-07-07 09:45:00,6,1,relationship_advice

really do not like when my girlfriend [F20] will post her figure on social media. Her butt and boobs in specific. 

I’ve spoken to her about this before and she agreed that she wouldn’t show it off on social media anymore. Yet this morning I wake up to a booty pic on her story. She’s clothed up but I still don’t like that all her followers can just see her butt like that.  

She also tagged me in the photo. But idk maybe it’s just in my head but I don’t feel too comfortable with it. Am I overreacting?

TL;DR!- I have talked to my girlfriend about posting her sexual parts of her body on social media. Yet she still did it. She tagged me of course. Am I making too much of a big deal?",2019-07-06 20:43:51,27,11,relationship_advice

476,ca54c9,cumstainedtshirt,I (20M) have attachment problems with friend with benefits (21F).,"I have known this girl since 2 years but only started having this kind of physical relationship for 1 month. I have liked this girl since the minute I have seen her. But I was in a really low-confidence point in my life so I couldnt make a move. We hanged out as friends most of the time and she did not like me that much back than and thought I was a scumbag etc. Recently I have been improving myself and started talking to her again. One day we went to eat something together and that went really well. So I invited her to my place couple weeks later. We made out etc. After talking about what have happened we decided not to get in a serious relationship and will stay friends with benefits. This went on for a month and we will meet up again a week later. Even just last night we talked on the phone until 6am, so if you are looking from outside this relationship seems nice. But on the inside, atleast in my part, I dont know what to feel. I know she is also seeing somebody and I dont like it. Also I have never been in a serious relationship too. I have only hooked up with girls and never really wanted to open up myself to them. Always found it unnecessary. I have been good with letting people go in my life and cutting them off once I get bored. I find loving people and feeling loved very hard so every relationship I have with a person seems very fake and skin-based. But with this girl, I really want to love her and be loved. But I feel like with every move I make I might lose her. I might say something outlandish or rude and she might change her opinion about me. Im afraid she will cut me out of her life because I can also cut people without much effort. What can I do to have more positive mindset in this and other relationships?

477,ca541g,throwaway22445566778,Is it me or this actually bullshit?,"Throwaway account just in case someone I know is on reddit. So this is kind of just a long rant but today I had the shittiest day. I got yelled at by my manager because I asked if I could leave early because of some babysitting issues and she completely lost it on me then told me, my other manager that I’m actually pretty close with told her I called out last week for a date. I did not call out because of a date im in a committed relationship and we don’t go on dates. If we do it’s when we both don’t work. I can’t afford to miss work for something like a date, I had to call out because again babysitting issues. I have a three year old and only one reliable babysitter which is my sister who happens to be a server like me and we work similar hours. We make it work and I usually don’t miss work often but if I do I give a heads up and I try to make it up by staying late for them if someone else calls out any other day. So after she tried to tell me”we all know you called out for a date” I lost it. I told her that was complete bullshit considering I never said anything about a date to anyone and I have texts from my sister and to my other manager to prove why I called out that day. She then proceeded to tell me my behavior at work is terrible and I explained to her why because every time I step into this place there is an issue with somebody and someone is saying untrue things so I keep to myself and try not to deal with anyone. I then went on to explain that my other manager who up until this point  i would have defended, constantly sends me home so she can serve when she’s making 15-16$ an hour and isn’t supposed to. While I making 11$ and hour depend on my tips to make ends meat. Not to mention starts taking tables and tells the host to seat her section twice then seat me. Also I’m the one person who for some reason gets screwed over when it comes to seating my section will be skipped or people will just ignore that I’m there. I’m nice to everyone, I’m just not open and bubbly like I used to be because I’ve seen what happens. All of this adding up has made me hate going to work and I laid it all out for her and she told me she is going to set up a meeting between my general manager, herself, the dumb bitch who lied about why I called out, and myself. I apologized to her about my recent behavior because at the end of the day it is work and I need to be professional and she said she understands but I need to tell my head manager about the lying manager because what she’s doing isn’t right. Idk I feel upset that a person I thought was a friend stabbed me in the back for no reason and that my boss completely tore me to shreds over me needing to go pick up my daughter.

479,ca53uo,Gunslinger148,Girl seemed super into me than flaked. What went wrong?," This girl (F24) is a friend of a female friend of mine (M29) so I run into her sometimes. I did manage to have sex with her once last year when her bf and her were split briefly. She and her bf broke up again about 5 months ago. After a couple months I ask her out and she agrees. The date goes well and we end up at her place. We make out a lot and I try for sex a few times but she wouldn't let me, she kept saying not yet, we can't, etc. I run into her a couple weeks later at a friends hot tub. I start kissing her but she gets weird and says she can't. She is talking to her ex again. Regardless we end up making out all night and back at her place. This happens a couple times. I eventually end up telling her to call me when she figures the ex thing out and when she actually wants to spend time with me.

We don't talk for a month. She calls me up randomly and says she will be at my friends pool that day and wants to see me. We hang out that day and start talking again. She offers to take me to dinner because she owed me a couple drinks from when we were out. I tell her I'll pick her up Sunday at 6 at her place and we will go out. She agrees. I show up sunday and I see her car isn't there. I call her and she says she totally forgot and is down the street doing laundry at her friends house. To stay there and she is on the way back. She shows up about 10 min later. She apologizes and says she is terrible at remembering things and gets ready and we go to dinner, she pays and she is touching me and playing with her hair the whole time. Definite IOI's. We go back to her place and we make out quite a bit. I get a bit drunk and say I like her...she says she likes me too. She gets a call from her sister and she has to go pick her up like an hour away, some kind of family drama. Her druggie mom left her on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere. She says she is happy I put a smile on her face with all this drama going on and needed that. We agree to see each other friday and she tells me to text her to remind her later in the week. I agree, I normally wouldn't but my best friend is always forgetting things too so I give her the benefit of the doubt.

The next day she texts me.

\- Her: Thank you for being around last night. I'm so sorry about what happened (having to leave early). I had fun though and dinner kicked ass

\- Me: Don't worry about it! It wasn't your fault and family is important. I had a blast!

\- Her: Thank you so much. I look forward to seeing you later this week!

At this point it seems like she is totally into me. She was all over me, we were making out. She initiated the texting the next day and says she can't wait to see me and is sorry about what happened.

4 days later on the day we are supposed to hang out I text her

\- Me: Hey, I hope you've had a good week. I'm looking forward to seeing you today!

\- Her: Hey! It's been a wild week haha but good! And likewise. You learned to remind me 🤣 I forgot already lmao

\- Her: Man I'm good at committing to plans and not following through lmao (I feel like this was a pretty shitty thing to say, she is pretty much bragging about being a flake. I don't like this)

\- Me: You're terrible. Lol. Give me a call later when you're done at work.

She calls me a bit later and says she is going to talk to a manager at this new place she is trying to get hired at later in evening. That we can still hang out but she has to go do that first. I say ok, let me know when you are done.

She never contacted me. I don't understand how she can be so back and forth in a matter of days. What do I do? Did I do something wrong? I must have done something to turn her off....She seemed super into me and texted me the next day then she just blows me off....I feel like total shit over this whole thing.",2019-07-07 09:37:52,2,1,relationship_advice
480,ca53ts,LifeSandwich,My (27m) gf (27) slept with her ex's best friend (23m) when we were dating and still have a lot of contact,"So, some back story. My (27m) girlfriend (27f) have been seeing since september, we both met other people during this time and it didn't get serious and exclusive till december. 

&amp;#x200B;

In october, she slept with one of her best friends. And I think it adds to the story that the person, lets call him F, was her exes best friend. However, she claims they only slept once. But they are still in regular contact. He’s abroad at the moment but they chat a lot over Facebook. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe this shouldnt disturb me. But before we went serious she told me that she’d never been faithful in a relationship. However, she has promised me to be completely honest and she’s been super transparent so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

I happend to see a conversation between them a month or so ago that read like:

*F: ive lost some weight since I moved here.*

*GF: oh no. But you still got your butt?*

*F: no, i lost a bit there aswell.*

*Gf: oh no, your butt is sooo good ❤️*

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since, I’ve had a hard time not thinking about this. And I’ve dreamt numerous times that they had an affair. I know that probably doesnt mean anything but it still bothers my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will never tell her to quit their friendship. That’s not how I roll. But my question is, should I walk away. Are there too many red flags? I’m honestly madly in love with her but I just know that this will be unbearable when he gets back home and they hang out by themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

And with a history of getting cheated on, I know how much that hurts and really never want to experience those feelings ever again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I being ridiculous? I need your perspective, reddit. ",2019-07-07 09:37:44,5,1,relationship_advice

That was her first relationship. I really like her, but I don't know where to take our relationship. We get along great, and we can just talk for hours. We both want a serious relationship, not what people our age usually want. We're both a little weird, and not the typical teenagers. At least in my opinion, sorry if I'm offending anybody. She's really into anime, dungeons and dragons, and drawing. I'm a big introvert, and we both have a few mental issues.

483,ca3jqt,JustLimping,My (21M) girlfriend (20F) makes some really nasty food and idk what to do. Continue eating or be honest,"My girlfriend is very very sweet and I love her so I hope this doesn’t come off the wrong way, I appreciate what she does for me 

So basically my girlfriend is like the “wifey material” type of girl you know, she likes cleaning and cooking and hosting dinner parties for her friends and she’s very crafty and she can fix the buttons on my shirt if they’re loose, she’s like really great. She’s always baking and cooking for me and bringing things probably every time I see her and it’s very sweet but some of the things just don’t taste good 

Like she made these fried chicken sandwiches and she loves getting them from restaurants so she tried making them and they were so fucking bad like the first bite gave me a stomach ache, it was mushy and burnt at the same time. she made it for us and she watches me and asks “do you like them?” With this cute smile and of course I say I love them and she keeps making them. Sometimes they are better than the first time but she still hasn’t really gotten the hang of those chicken sandwiches and it’s torture 

She makes some things incredibly well, like better than a restaurant she makes this dish with spaghetti like noodles in this broth with beans and ground beef and these other stuff and she even makes little tiny cubed French fries to sprinkle on top because the crunch is nice and it’s like the most perfect food for a cold day. She makes that SOOOO WELL it’s easily my favorite food ever, sorry mom. And in my dorm she can take ramen noodles and add a whole bunch of other stuff to them and make them gourmet like she’s incredible with that and she treats me so well. 

And then she tried making cookies. She is really good at making brownies, she uses the box mix but who cares she makes it better than anyone I know and she adds walnuts to it. But she thinks box mix is cheating and won’t accept compliments on it. And then she tried making chocolate chip cookies from scratch. It didn’t taste good at ALL. But she thought they were so good so I ate like 2 and then she gave me the rest and said to eat them. I fed them to some birds outside :/ I couldn’t eat it!! She made other cookies another time but they were so soft they broke when I was taking a bite. I had to just quickly stuff it in my mouth at once so it didn’t break. I asked her why they were breaking so much and she said it was supposed to be like that and then she was like “do you not like them??” And she got sad. I said no I love them, make me more next time too, I want to eat them everyday. I’m so dumb I know, but I just feel bad

It’s not that she is BAD at cooking. Some things are really really good and then other things just make me wanna vomit. She is great at making that dish I described up there she just calls it her spaghetti soup lol it’s a funny name and chicken salad sandwiches and lemon soup and chicken noodle soup but she can’t make other things so well. I obviously can’t be like “can you stop making me food it doesn’t taste good” but damn some of the stuff are so bad and she just watches me for my reaction so I have to eat it. She gets really happy if I say it tastes so good and she’s so talented and all that so I compliment it. It’s true, she is a great cook but she has her specialities. Like the things she makes well, they are REALLY GOOD and then the other things are just .. not so great. 

Do I just eat the bad food?? I don’t wanna discourage her or anything because she prides herself on the fact that she can cook and that I love her cooking. Ahhh I do love it it’s just certain things. I really hope I don’t get any comments saying I’m being ungrateful because I’m not, I love that she cooks for me anyway and she’s still learning too so it’s not that big of a deal",2019-07-07 05:44:27,9,2,relationship_advice
484,ca3jjz,kkjh2019,Husband of 6 years has been lying throughout entire relationship.,"I am a 27 year old female. My husband is a 29 year old Male. We have been together for 13 years, but married for 6. We have 2 kids. A boy and a girl. The boy is 7 and the girl is 4.
I need an unbiased, straightforward advice of whether or not I should end my marriage and uproot my family due to there being no trust in the marriage anymore due to all the lies.

Background:
 We both grew up in a religious background. I more so than him. Neither of us are very religious now. I found out after 2 years of dating that he has been watching porn and up until that day I didnt think he watched it at all because he told me that he didn't and I believed him. When I was pregnant with our 1st born I found out that he continued to watch the porn and cheated on me multiple times. I found out by him telling me outright because he wanted to go into fatherhood with a clear conscious. When our firstborn was four months old I found out that he cheated on me again and was also still, continuing to watch porn.  Next, I found out that he was cheating on me, watching porn, and lying to me when our 2nd born was 3 months old. After this happened we went to marriage counseling. That's when I found out that I associate porn with lying. Granted, porn is a very common thing and a lot of people do it but, I don't know if I could ever accept it due to the fact that I was lied to about it throughout our entire relationship.Lastly, I found out the other day that he was continuing to watch it even though whenever I asked him about it  within the past 2 years he said he would never do it again because he cares too much about our family and since it almost destroyed us last time he wouldn't do it.

Advice questions: Should I try to do a trial run of our marriage of him watching porn, but have him be honest with me? Should I end things? Should we try and do counseling again even though what was discussed and agreed upon in therapy last time was apparently not listened to? I dont trust him with my feelings and I cant trust what he says!

Please note: We are not wealthy. We live paycheck to paycheck. He is a great dad and a good overall person, but is unfaithful (didn't catch him actually cheating this time - just porn) and a liar. He cooks, he cleans, everything always seems to be going great and then I find out something.

485,ca51tn,throwaway99984dff,Dating question,"Hello all, hoping for some advice. I’m not a big dater and haven’t been in a serious relationship for about 6 or 7 years when I was in college at the time. I recently started hanging out with a girl I know through a mutual friend and we’ve been talking for about a month or two. I’ve known her for a while but only recently started thinking of her in the dating sense. It’s nothing too serious yet, but I like this person and am open to seeing where it might go. In these past few months we’ve hung out multiple times, both one-on-one and in group settings with our friends, and have been texting fairly frequently. I feel like it’s been going well, and until now I felt the feeling was mutual. But during one of our recent text conversations she told me she’s been on a date with someone else in the same time frame that she and I have been talking and hanging out. That’s not a problem for me by any means as she’s her own person and can do what she wants, and like I said before we haven’t really established anything serious. But now I’m wondering if my interest in her wasn’t mutual and she sees me as just a friend. I realize this sounds very high schoolish but I was just hoping for some advice on what to do next. I do like her but I’m worried about jeopardizing our friendship and making things weird (both with her and our other friends) if she doesn’t feel the same way.

486,c9wcza,Ernie_Solorzano,My girlfriend has become dependent,"The other day my girl friend got into an argument with her mom and tried to take her own life. She was put on a 72 hour hold in a mental facility which seemed to help. When she got out and was with me she was happy and bliss. Once we go to her house her family was trying to figure out what was causing the depression and she explained she was trigger a few years ago when her mom tried to kick her out.  Her family seems to understand but her sister blamed my for her depression. Saying I put her down and that it started when she started dating me. My girlfriend kept defending me saying it wasn’t me but some underlying issues that happened before we even started dating. 
Her sister eventually tried to get physical with me and it ended up turning into a whole mess. 
A mutual friend of my girl friend and mine is staying with her to try and help her through this. 
The friend had explained to me that my girlfriend has become so attached to me and has become dependent on me being her only source of happiness. 
My friends goal is to help her learn to love herself so she can come back to me and be better for the relationship and herself. 

I feel very melancholy about the whole situation. 
I love her and want to be with her to help her but I know she needs to work on herself. 
I’m also very insecure about myself because I feel she’s gonna lose that connection we had.

487,ca0b3c,thekittyztittiez,My [23F] overly sheltered SIL [23F] is moving in with my wife [24F] and me.,"My SIL and MIL live together in Massachusetts, however their house got foreclosed so they have to move out on Wednesday. I absolutely love my MIL and SIL and we all get along great. My MIL is going to go live with another family member near her current town. My SIL is coming down to Alabama (1200+ miles away from Massachusetts) to live with my wife and me which I have no problem with. My doors are completely open to her and we get along very well. My  wife also gets along great with her sister as they are only a year apart so they grew up doing everything together.

My SIL [23F] is overly sheltered and mentally immature for her age. She has no driver’s license, she only works about 10 hours a week at a retail job making her state’s minimum wage, and plays video games all day. She’s very nice and respectful, it’s just as if she has the mind of a 13 year old. She has lived with my MIL her whole life. My MIL is a recovering extreme hoarder so the living conditions my MIL and SIL lived in were always unhealthy, physically and mentally. Their house doesn’t even have heat or hot water.

This will be the first time my SIL has been without my MIL for more than a few hours. My SIL won’t even take public transportation by herself (they live in Boston suburbs where public transportation is everywhere) to get to and from work. My MIL either has to drive her or take the bus to work with her. My MIL and SIL even work together. So they are literally together 24/7. I’m extremely surprised we were even able to talk my SIL into moving down here with us since my MIL won’t be coming with her.

Overall, my SIL has had no real job and she has no real life skills. She has no idea how to do laundry or cook basic meals. She has no severe mental health problems or learning problems. She has just been so sheltered her whole life. My wife and I are also in the process of trying to have a baby (same-sex couple here), but we have absolutely no problem letting my SIL live with us during the process.

How can my wife and I help my SIL transition into the adult life? I don’t want to see her waste her life away because she has such high potential. She’s an absolutely hilarious person and awesome to be around. She could have a lot going for her if she really tried. I understand that it’s not my responsibility to take care of someone my own age but I want to help her get back on her feet and let her see that she can make something of herself.",2019-07-06 23:40:53,7,5,relationship_advice
488,ca50nf,throwaway20190707a,I [23M] cannot get aroused with my girlfriend [22F],"My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 7 months. We were set up through mutual friends. We are both each other's first partners. I think that she is an amazingly kind and smart person, and I enjoy being around her. However, when it comes to sex, we have not found much success. Earlier into the relationship I could at least get an erection when we tried to become physically intimate, but ultimately would lose it. And since then it has only gotten worse. I haven't had an erection when with her in the past couple of weeks. I don't know what to do. I think she is pretty but definitely not my type look-wise. But I feel like that shouldn't prevent me from being aroused by her. We are both inexperienced with sex, which maybe could exasperate it. Am I just in denial here - that I just don't think she is attractive? or could it be something else? I feel bad that I am stuck on this when I really like her so much as a person.

I don't think it is general ED because I can get erect if I see or watch someone/something arousing to me. And I don't think it is performance anxiety either. I don'f feel nervous at all. Anyway, I'd just appreciate any comments or suggestions you might have.",2019-07-07 09:24:07,4,1,relationship_advice

491,ca4zl7,razzyboss1,I fear that my (18M) relationship with my girlfriend (18F) is getting too serious,"So this is more like a guys thing. I love my girlfriend  and we've been together for 2 years and i seriously can't think of anyone that can make me as happy as this.

Only problem is, i'm still young and i know that. I keep having these... Urges i guess. I mean she's the only sex partner i have ever had and i would really want to... Well... Explore.

I don't know how to approach this. She'll move in with me for 2 months until her parents find her an apartment. 

I would love to ask for an open relationship but i fear that would only hurt her... 

My friends (that are idiots btw) keep saying that i should dump her because ""you're young and seem like you're already married""

She has been talking about future plans like getting a house together and having kids someday and stuff like that (which i'm not COMPLETELY against, because again, i do love her)

I live in constant fear because i'm scared i might get drunk one day and cheat on her simply because i want a change in my sex life... 

I realise that this isn't a very important matter, but i'm just confused about this situation and would need some advice.

I fear that i will grow old and never experienced any other girl and will end up regretting it... 

It's been on my mind for a while, so please don't mock me and take this at least a bit seriously...

492,ca4zfk,Greedy_World,Me [20M] need help finding out [19F] intentions.,"Hi, so essentially I met this girl online and started talking with her, we kicked it off and it's been about a week now since we first met, we both live in different states across the country. We have similar interests like music, gaming and cars. We talk everyday, and she always texts back long meaningful responses to keep the convo going, as do I. We've shared countless photos and snaps and we've even shared personal photos (baby and family) and secrets/problems. To cut it short she's literally my ideal girl and the signs she's been sending show she has major interest in me. But recently about one day ago we were talking and flirting as per usual and she suddenly started being super sensitive, like I would make a joke to tease her that I normally would and she would suddenly be super offended. I tried asking her what was wrong and she kept pushing me away saying things that ending up hurting my feelings, Im perplexed. I'm lost for words and don't know what I did wrong or what changed.

494,ca4z4p,insecureboy01,Guy(22m) that I (18m) like really sucks at communicating and makes me feel like he maybe doesn't like me the same way I do,"So... There's this guy I like. He's 22, I'm 18 (in a couple of weeks). He's a really sweet guy actually and studies autonomous art. We've had our first date June 21st, the day prior to that however he picked me up in his car at around 1am (I know a bit sketchy, he was first planning on coming by bike because he just wanted to come over and give me a hug, he's really cute). He just wanted to give me a hug because I wasn't feeling so well, I had some stress about my exams. I ended up asking if we could drive around town a little and he agreed! We drove around and talked for an hour or so, had some deep convos, and it was so so nice! He really understands me and we sorta come from the same financial background and so much other stuff... I felt really comfortable and warm when talking to him! He dropped me off at 2am, we kissed and hugged again and then we had a random date planned the next day. We went to this beautiful lake and just had some deep conversations again about everything and also just some random fun ones, we ended up going to his house, he showed me some of his art which was beautiful! We listened to some tunes, he almost gave me a tattoo, but ofcourse I said no because that stuff is permanent and I should think that through hahaha... But again we had an amazing evening, we did end up having sex hehe... And I stayed over at his place because it was a bit too late to go home now ^^;
I got up around 6, he was still sleeping. I had to go home because I forgot to tell my parents I was staying over at someone's place, usually I tell them, but I genuinely forgot! I woke him up at 7:30, told him I have to go home. He got a bit sad about it, but yeah I kissed him goodbye, went home, my parents weren't that mad at me, rather surprised that I didn't notify them... I was also surprised of myself, I was just so deep in the moment that evening that I just forgot and went to sleep! Silly me...
We ended up texting each other 2-3 days and then he told me he was going to be busy from Monday 'till July 5th with work, school, festivals and vernissages (never knew what that was until he told me hahaha). I'm still waiting for him to text me because the last time we talked it was him telling me he's sorry for not being able to respond so quickly and me telling him it's okay and that I understand. I don't want to seem like I'm forcing myself on him... But sometimes I see him online or I see that he watched my IG Stories and I know it's just me being a bit insecure and that I just should wait for him to text me...
I really don't want to mess this up since I've done this before... I like a guy --&gt; mutual feelings --&gt; I start getting overly attached and text them everyday to the point that there's literally no conversation material left... I just hope he likes me too because he's really charismatic and he's such a great guy from what I've experienced already!

A little update on this story though: he texted me through WhatsApp 4 days ago saying ""Hey boy, I was gone for a while haha"" to which I responded with ""Hey, that's fine! How was Werchter? :)"" (Werchter is a Belgian festival that's being held every year and he went for a couple of days). He still hasn't read my text after 4 days and has been online a few times on WhatsApp and posts a story on IG sometimes and it just makes me feel like he's not interested in me, or maybe he is? I don't know... I don't even know if he just wanted to hookup with me or date me because for me that was a date and not a hookup... And I'm too afraid or shy to ask him how he feels about me because it's probably weird to ask after literally just one date... But I just felt a connection there...",2019-07-07 09:17:36,1,0,relationship_advice
495,ca3fsu,throwawaylxve,My (23M) Girlfriend (20F) of 3 years (today) broke up/ needs space. I dont know what to do,"Hey guys, im extremely desperate and i dont know what to do. Shit hurts.

Today is our third year anniversairy, but sadly a couple days ago, she told me that she wants some space but she also broke up with me. 
We live together for 2,5 years because Back in the day we had some issues with our Parents. At the beginning like the First 2 years were great. We didnt have that much to discuss, we were happy. But things changed and we started to find ourselves to be in a Discussion more often. What i try to explain is, that she probarbly had the idea to break up earlier. 
In this case she said she is done and dont want to be with me anymore. I asked for the reasons of course. She said it doesnt have to do anything with me. Its her and her Charakter that she is unhappy about. She wants to change herself to become better. I offered to help her, because no one knows her as good as me, but she kept refusing.
After that i had 2 days to Think. I figured some stuff i did wrong and thought if i Tell her about them, what i also found out on my own, she may accept it. At first she did but later in the evening while i had to work, she went away with some friends to party. Her answers were short and she wasnt optimistic as in the morning before. She was partying with friends i dont know about and seemed to have fun. I asked her, if i can catch her up so she can come home safely (we still live together) but she was partying from 10pm to unknown because her battery died i guess and she replied at 6am that she will be sleeping at her girlfriends House because she cant take it to be here on our anniversairy.
It was Strange, she was optimistic at the beginning of the day. She sent me some pictures of a ring i bought her, but when i replied that it looked beautiful on her, she didnt responsed anymore. 
I know her, her behaviour is extremely unusual for her. I know that she Loves me. i can See that its hard for her (why does she even want to break up then?) as she cried when she read what i discussed with her best friend, what i want to change about myself and do for her.

She has vacation right now and she will go with her friend to her friends family. Last morning she told me that her plans where that she wanted to break up before her departure (10 days), but After my speech she was more optimistic and said that she will overthink everything when she is there. 

I have no Idea what to do. Especially because she will be There in 6 days and i have to see her for that long at our home.

She was partying same Place yesterday, too (of course I dislike that, but There is nothing i can say about). I was at my work but they told me to go home cause i was crying all the time. 
I really love her and want to be with her. She told me that she loves me, too. How can i be successful?

I really need Help.

496,ca4yks,femplex,Healthy ways to manage my jealousy when my Bf is gone.,"So my [24F] boyfriend [30M] travels a lot for work. Normally this doesn't bother me too much because it's for his job and he's really good at maintaining communication with me when he's gone. We'll pretty much text most of the day and have long video calls almost daily once he's off work. Essentially he goes the extra mile to keep me reassured and I really appreciate it.

But on the flip side, because he's so good at keeping in contact, whenever he gets too caught up or busy I start to find myself jumping to the worst conclusions (not openly, so he has no idea and I'd rather not tell him and make him feel like he's not doing enough because I realize that this is a ""Me"" problem).

Earlier this week one of his work clients decided to surprise his team with a 4th of July celebration since they are all Americans and pretty far from home. A really nice surprise if you ask me, especially considering he mentioned to me earlier how sad he was that he would be missing the festivities. 

But he didn't contact me all morning, which was intentional on his part to cater to the time difference so I wasn't too worried, and because the surprise happened after work (around mid afternoon here i.e. around the time I usually expect to start hearing from him), he got pretty caught up with the festivities and didn't message/call. I didn't hear from him until the next day but he made sure to let me know why he was mia.
The problem is, while this all was happening I was jumping to all sorts of crazy assumptions in my head. 

I didn't express any of this to him because I think it would be pretty unfair to make him feel like he wasn't doing enough after all the lengths he goes to in an attempt to keep me reassured, just because he got a bit caught up having fun with his work buddies. I also don't want him to think he's not free to go along with the occasional impromptu event/activity because of me. 

So what are some healthier ways to manage my jealousy in moments like this?",2019-07-07 09:15:10,1,0,relationship_advice
497,ca4yfq,noamros9,How do I [22M] get rid of my jealousy in my GF[20F]?,"I'm a late bloomer - up until a year ago, I didn't really had any success with girls, not even holding hands in this matter.

In the winter, I've met my girlfriend. She's the most sweet, caring, smart and loving person I have ever known, and I love her so much. She really is the best. She was my first in everything - being affectionate, kissing, having sex, spending the night with. And to be honest, I couldn't have wished for someone better to experience it with. She was (and still is) patient, understanding and considerate.

I am not her first, nor her second or third. And for some reason, I'm a bit jealous. I know that there is nothing good outside. I don't want meaningless sex just because. I don't want some girl for a one night stand. She actually said to me that she wished I was her first too (she was sexually harassed, assualted and treated badly by Exs - and I'm trying my best to be there for her, to comfort her when she's having a hard time and never ever to make her feel like I'm not on her side).

I just want to get rid of these thoughts. She's the only thing I want. I don't want to care what she's done before me, because I have no right to - it was her choice, and only hers. 

What could I do?",2019-07-07 09:14:30,1,0,relationship_advice
498,ca4xti,Magicsuperdebbi,What can I do about insensitive brother-in-law?,"This is long, and I am sorry, but it needs to be for clarity. TLDR at bottom. 

I (34F) live with my boyfriend of 10 years (36M) and his good friend (32M) . My boyfriend has an identical twin brother (36M). I am on the lease with another, absentee friend (abroad for months,doesn't factor in), and the boyfriend and friend sublet to me. 

I honestly don't have a nice thing to say about this man-twin I have tried to be a good and kind person when it comes to him, but he just pushes all the boundaries. I think he is an asshole,TBH, and as a result I judge him harsher then I would others. That being said,  all this is my objective account.  

He is a deadbeat father of two who has messed up every living situation since I have known him (10+ years). He usually gets kicked out of places by either failing to pay owed/promised rent several times in a row or by running his mouth off--or by a combination of the two. 

Not that it's the measure of a person,  but he doesn't even have a bank account.

He is my love's twin, however, and we try to help him when we can. He would come crash a few times a month and do laundry  here, ect. 

Despite knowing his instability and irresponsibly,  when our roommate left (to go abroad), we invited the twin to come live here, as he was currently homeless,  granted he pay that portion of the rent.  $600/month, includes everything. 

It wasn't much, but he would have good friends and a roof over his head and we'd even share warm meals when there was extra. 

It didn't take him long to mess things up. He quickly fell behind in payments and then would lie about having the money or when he would be able to pay. Several times this man looked me dead in the eyes and said ""I will have $$$ by Saturday and will give it to you."" Only to go to his baby Mama's on Friday and not return until Tuesday or Wednesday.  Not answering the phone, or her phone, in the meantime.  

And the suckers that we were, my boyfriend and I would let him back in, listen to his excuses and let him try again.  All the while scrambling to  cover the rent in the meantime.  

On a side note here, I would like to interject that he always seemed to have money for weed (it's legal here) but would often bum bus money and food from his brother.  

The other thing I think is important to know is that he has a habit of breaking and/or losing things. He rarely has a functioning phone, and after I asked him specifically not to remove my tablet from the house,  he did so and returned it with a cracked screen. He'll ""accidentally "" take chargers or headphones and return them months later, broken or damaged. This is common with him. He is absent minded, but also a dick,  imo. 

This went on for a few months until we finally kicked him out after he spent rent money on Christmas presents, and it was the last straw. We were strained for money ourselves, and weren't able to give gifts to anyone as a result of having to cover his rent again. 

By the time he left, he owed me almost $2000 in back rent and my boyfriend almost $900. 

To be blunt, I am pretty angry with him. It isn't just the rent,  but the lying and taking advantage that pisses me off. 

And he keeps saying he will pay us back, but I haven't seen a dime.  

Here is where my dilemma lies: he is still my boyfriend's twin and good friend of our other roommate and they have seemingly forgiven him and want AND invite him around. 

I neither want him in my house our using any of my things. (all the dishes and the television and even the washing machine are mine) I am still very upset.  I am hurt about being lied to. Upset about having the extra expenses--and still paying for the credit cards and payday loan I had to take out to cover the rent-- and I need time to calm down. 

Do you know when you're so upset with someone that the sound of their chewing ticks you off? Well I am still there. 

We kicked him out months ago and these two jackasses keep letting him come back in. 

I specifically asked for 90 days without him around--I didn't even get two weeks before he was back here. We live in a place that has winter, and no, I absolutely don't want him to freeze or get sick, I just wish it wasn't my couch he had to crash on during the snowstorms. 

And I just want to say he isn't allowed over here, but I feel like that is being unkind. And they think I am really hard on him. To which I replied that he owes me almost two grand, I can be snippy. 

Yes, I do take some things over the top. But, I feel I have no agency here. I feel like I cannot say no. How can I let someone be exposed to the elements like that? 

Here is my problem.  Today, I am sitting at my desk, playing games at 1am. My boyfriend has gone to bed and roommate to work (graveyard), and all of a sudden, Twin comes up from downstairs.  

I had no clue this man was even in my house, and when I ask him how long he has been here, he says just a little bit, he fell asleep.  

I asked who let him into the house and he says roommate, when boyfriend and I were gone. That was 7 hours ago!!!

I am upset, but go to get boyfriend to talk to him so I don't lose my temper.  Boyfriend is using the restroom, but will be right down. 

Twon says he didn't mean to fall asleep and it is no big deal. And that I shouldn't freak out, because I always freak out. He was supposed to get up when roommate went to work, but apparently roommate let him sleep. 

Roommate didn't tell us he was here. And I think it's important to know who is in your house.  Besides the obvious safety concerns,  it's just polite. Plus, roommate knows the issues we've had with twin.

Twin tells me not to be upset.  It wasn't intended.  I tell him he had no right to sleep here anymore.  He messed up that priviledge.  He agrees, but says oh well it happens, just don't be mean to roommate. 

I tell him not to tell me how to live my life  or treat others and to get out of my house. 

He leaves.

I go upstairs and am angry at boyfriend for not coming downstairs and having my back. It's been 20 minutes since I asked for his help. 

He comes downstairs and calls twin. Twin comes back and they have a quite argument outside. 

Boyfriend agrees it wasn't okay to be at the house sleeping for hours.  Twin says he did nothing wrong. Twin leaves angry. 

Boyfriend is angry with twin and with me for yelling at him. Storms upstairs to go to bed.

I almost want to kick roommate out over this. I feel like he is sneaking twin in and letting him have and use whatever he wants. 

I feel so powerless.  Twin seems able to go through life and mess things up for others without consequences.  


TLDR:Brother in law keeps coming around after boundary violations and owing us large amounts of money; roommate and boyfriend inviting/welcoming him.

I met these girls at a party, we were driving out with some of my buddies. The girls ended up in our laps, I didn’t get a boner and honestly didn’t really get much choice in the matter. I was up front in the car and she was on top of me. As Maria and Dominic began to kiss, she leaned in to kiss me. I had my hands up for a moment and I turned away, I don’t know what drove me to put my hands down, but I did and she leaned in and kissed me. 

She knew I had a gf, but she did it anyways. All it was was kissing, but holy shit has it been eating at me. I just can’t believe I did it. I can’t believe I didn’t have more control. I can’t believe I didn’t get out of the car. I can’t believe I fucked up this bad. I’m so ashamed. I don’t know what to do and I don’t know what’ll happen.

501,ca4won,Uglyboy2000,I'm [21M] too scared to message her [older than me] and ask her out.,"Thursday evening I got talking to a girl on the train home. Her name is Amy and we seemed to get along really well. I made her laugh a lot and vice versa, and I like to think the chemistry was there.

She lives in the same area as me and it turns out we actually went to the same school growing up, though she left a few years before I started. She is in her late twenties (possibly early thirties?) and I am 21. She's still living with parents just like me so we're still sort of at the same ''life stage''.

The thing is that when I was getting off the train I asked if she had instagram. She said ''No, but I do have facebook''. My immediate thought was that she had no reason to tell me that. If she had no interest she would simply have said ''no, sorry''. She was also perfectly happy for us to add each other. From experience if someone isn't too interested they'd say something like ''I don't feel comfortable adding people I don't know'' which is perfectly understandable of course. The conversation was so good that even when I stood up to get off the train at my stop, we ended up having another chat so I had to sprint off the train before the doors closed. I asked if I could message her on facebook and she said sure.

See the thing is she is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful. Way out of my league. While I prefer older women, I understand that a lot of older women will not give a younger man a chance. Which is their choice of course but it would be another problem.

OTOH I chatted to a few (girl) friends of mine and they said they wouldn't have acted the way she did if they weren't interested. They said that if a guy who they weren't into asked if they had instagram, they wouldn't have given him another means of talking to her. The problem is she was a really bubbly person so for all I know she could just be really kind and outgoing and happy to friend any random she meets on facebook. Considering that we were in a train in public she may also have felt uncomfortable humiliating me by saying no (on that point, I made a point not to ask her until I was leaving the train, so that way if she said no and felt uncomfortable she would never have to see me again).

I want to message her tomorrow but I'm scared to take that leap of faith. My life has seen a lot of disappointment recently, not just relating to girls but I also lost out on my dream job recently in spite of doing everything right and being formally offered said job. I can't help but wonder if disappointment is the default setting and that things just aren't going to work out. I know I have ''nothing to lose'' or whatever but all that failure, rejection and disappointment starts to hurt after a while.

Tl;dr: I met a girl and like to think she was interested. She gave me her facebook when she didn't have to. But I'm so scared of things not working out as usual that I'm too scared to try.",2019-07-07 09:07:07,3,0,relationship_advice

506,c9uxow,DJSkrillex,My[M18] girlfriend[F18] is obsessed with kpop. How do I deal with that?,"So she's absolutely obsessed with kpop. I don't like it, but I listen to it with her since it makes her happy. But her obsession with these dudes is starting to get annoying. She keeps talking about how sweet, cute and perfect they are in every way. I know it may seem ridicilous, but it's starting to drive me away from her. I tried ignoring how she gushes over this one guy, but I can't do that anymore.

It's not my cup of tea, but there's nothing wrong with being a huge fan of kpop. That doesn't bother me. But this obsession with 1 guy crosses the line imo. And what's fucked is if I mention a female singer like Selena Gomez for example and tell her that I like her music, she tells me I should only think about her (my gf). Like bruh, do you not see how hypocritical that is. I jokingly asked ""what, am I not allowed to have my own idols and be a fanboy?"" and she said no. Not even in a joking manner, just a straight up no. Wtf?? She also likes to post pics of this kpop dude with hearts and stuff.

Am I being crazy or is this not ok?

**TL;DR**: Girlfriend is obsessed with kpop. She gushes over this 1 dude from a band. But according to her I'm not allowed to fanboy over a female singer. How do I deal with this? Sorry, but breaking up isn't an option.

507,ca39u1,thrwyayahdgwhaytwh,I [26m] watch my girlfriend [24f] masturbate when I pretend to sleep and at this point it’s an obsession and I don’t know if I should tell her.,"Obvious throwaway. Need real advice, though. I thought about posting this on AITA, you may see why.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for four years and moved in together about 6 months ago. She always told me she has a high sex drive and I do too, so I thought it works perfectly.

About three months into moving in, she started masturbating in the bathroom when I would go to sleep. I don’t know if she actually started masturbating that one night or if I only just realized she was doing it because I was asleep the other nights.

I jerked off to the quiet, muffled sounds she made behind the door when I was laying in bed. It was hard to keep everything quiet for myself, but she took longer than I did so clean up was quick.

I should probably mention that we also hadn’t had sex that night, she said she was too tired. 

So that’s the formula, basically. We don’t have sex one night, I go to bed before her due to my job, pretend to sleep, she goes to the bathroom 15 minutes after I go to bed, and we both cum (me to her masturbating, her to whatever she looks at on her phone).

Now here’s my issue. 

I’ve told her many times before I find it really hot to watch her, so she knows I like watching her masturbate. 

But I can’t help but feel like I’m violating her trust or that I should be honest and tell her I’m not actually sleeping... but I don’t want this to stop. 

But I also haven’t been sleeping much because I wake up at 4am for my job and she goes to bed late around 1 or 2... and I can’t help but wait and pretend to sleep to see if she would go to the bathroom after I “sleep”. I want to be honest and tell her, but I think her knowing I’m outside the bathroom door jerking off to her would lose the thrill of listening to her without her knowledge.

Couple of things to mention: 
We do have an active sex life. These are only the days where we don’t have sex. If we have sex one day, I don’t feel obligated to wait to cum to her masturbating in the bathroom. I just sleep easily. 
We are very open and honest about our kinks in the bedroom, this is the one I haven’t told her about because I just found out how much I love this since 3 months ago.
I have tried to mention this bit by bit, but she doesn’t seem to get it. I’ll drop hints by telling her I love listening to her moan when she masturbated, telling her I have the voyerism kink, and asking her to masturbate in front of me.

One final thing, she does it to reddit. I’m also interested to know what she masturbates to so that I can look at the same thing when she’s in the bathroom. I am not jealous about what she looks at, but I am curious to know.

TLDR; I haven’t been sleeping because I am obsessed with listening to my gf masturbate through the door. I think this may be a violation of her trust and I want to do the right thing while still having the thrill of listening to her when she thinks I’m asleep.

517,ca14s9,divisionybb,Am I right to be jealous and mad at my BF about his female roommate,"Me(24F) and my BF(24M) started dating couple months ago but I recently got annoyed by his female roommate. I’m cool with him hanging out with female friends, but this roommate make me really uncomfortable and we had some huge fights about her recently but let’s address these fights later.

He went to bar with her 1-1 for a couple nights and she likes to share her stories of flirting with other guys (she has a boyfriend who is also a mutual good friend of her and my BF).  She asks my BF for relationship advise of how to say no to the guys that she’s not interested in but goes very physical with her (which, in my eyes, just be a mature adult and shouldn’t have these concern in the first place). She goes into very detail with my BF about how other guys are being physical with her (like one time she sucked one of the dudes or another time one guy trying to slide his hands under her pants etc). I feel VERY uncomfortable listening to my BF talking about these but my BF seems really intrigued by her stories and everytime he came back with such conversations with her he shared those with me in a very exciting way.

He said that his roommate has problems of saying no to guys, according to her. My BF, as her friend, seems concerned of her not-being-able-to-say-no-to-guys that kind of crap. He said that before we met, there’s even one time they slept together in the same hotel room (they traveled with other friends but only them are left in the same room that night), and they could’ve happen something if he initiated.

So these make me really uncomfortable. I know that he has a very close relationship with his roommates and I’m glad that he has these close friends. So I feel really bad to start a fight with him regarding his roommate. One time I thought I couldn’t handle it anymore so I let him know that I’m not ok with him going to bar with another girl 1-1, roommate or not. We had a huge fight that night, but he agreed and apologized to me. But later on I found him still non-stop talking about his roommates stories, sexual parts for most. Then I’m annoyed and told him that I don’t like listening to other girls sexual stories. He also agreed but I’m still mad. I found that he chatted with his roommate and asked her for relationship advice that night when we first had the huge fight about him going to the bar with his roommate a lot.

So now I feel really disrespected. He seems to be reluctant to admit that he did anything wrong. I mean yes I don’t think he did anything wrong because he told me that they shared these personal stuff long before we met and he doesn’t like to explain to me too much. But right wrong aside, I feel sad and I’m not cool with this. If his roommate could keep her things more private and don’t share too much secrets with my BF I would respect his friends more and not throwing these arguments that I hate. Also, if he could be more caring about my feelings and not being so reluctant to relieve my concerns, I wouldn’t not letting things go. He thinks that he explained his point and so I should move on from this. But clearly I am hurt and I expect more caring from him. But he wouldn’t do anything to make sure that I’m okay. I’m slight disappointed. Not just because of his roommate, but because of his attitude I guess.

So am I right to be mad at him and being jealous about his female roommate? Thanks.",2019-07-07 01:05:26,4,5,relationship_advice
518,ca33yz,throwawayaccountdog1,Me (22M) currently not physically attracted to my girlfriend (20F) of 1 year,"Hi all, this is my first time posting here and I came to the realization today that I should seek some advice on my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Background information: We meet online a little over a year ago, went on a few dates not long after we first met and quickly became a couple, saying we love each other a few months after, and has been the best relationship we've both had along with seeing a future with each other after college as well. We both come from pasts of controlling or bad relationships and have had open and honest communication with no major arguments or issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Within the past half year she got a short ""butch""/ shaved sides style haircut which she was hesitant on but wanted it because she saw her friends had it, it a trend, and she gets bored with her styles after a few months. She was hesitant because she was worried what her parents and family would think and how it would actually turn out. I encouraged her because it's something shes wanted for a while and it would help with her self expression, confidence, and over all happiness. Getting a haircut doesn't hurt anything and it's something a person does for them self so there's nothing to do but be there for her and support her decision because I love her. While I'm not a fan of the style she went with I'm glad she went with it regardless because it made her much happier and boosted her self esteem.

&amp;#x200B;

Amount a month ago she got dermals on her upper chest as well which are like diamond studs. I wasn't a fan of them but I didn't tell her that so she wouldn't feel discouraged or hurt as it was something she implusively decided on getting because some she was going with someone who with was getting them too. She told me she was thinking about it that day and asked me what I thought, I said in an unsure tone that if it's something she really wants and that it's something you'll be happy with then it something you can go with. She still happy with them and is glad she got them.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week she got a foot long nature tattoo along the side of her rib cage that goes vertically. She was planning for some that too that went along her body or chest area and recently decided on what she got. We both already have some tattoos but she had ask me some months what my opinions are on chest (boob) tattoos I told her I'm not a fan of them and I don't think they look the greatest along with some other spots but if she wanted them there then I would not stop her if it's something she really wants.

&amp;#x200B;

My dilemma: With her recent physical appearance changes, they don't look quiet look appealing to me...during sex. Not to go very graphically from this, pretty much in every position we do it except for when we face each other her hair makes her look too much like a guy. Shes been growing out recently as well, it still short and looks like a male cut with medium length hair from behind. I still satisfy her sexually but it's been rather difficult for me these past months, taking me longer to reach orgasm, and these past two times I did not finish just saying that I was too tired or not in the mood. With the tattoos and dermals they don't help the situation either. I see pretty much almost nothing else but a guy's head laying down during sex which turns me off or makes me want to get this over with.

I never want to tell her to not do something that changes her appearance because who am I to try and get in the way, discourage her, make her feel bad, etc, if she wants to do something that will make her happy? I just want to support her and I love her to no end. Everything else in the relationship is fine but the sex which she enjoys having often. I don't want to be controlling and tell her not to do something because her haircuts, tattoos, and dermals don't harm anybody. It's something she does for herself. She's her own person and it's not her job or an object to look ""good"" for me. If we continue to have sex and my performance continues to struggle I'm not sure how I could continue to try. She noticed recently that I would be ""off"" after sex and asked me if everything is fine. I told her yes everything is fine. I feel that I'm making this into a bigger issue than it should be since she's growing her hair out, her tattoos and dermals shouldn't bother me. I love her regardless of her appearance but it's made intimate/physical attraction difficult. I felt bad for lying and not bringing something about this up. I know she's a bit sensitive about her look.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your opinions on this? Is this something worth bringing up, if so when should I bring it up, and how? I know her hair is temporary and in at least 3 months it'll be a non-guy resembling style and length. Am I wrong or mean or feeling this way? This is the first time I've had an issue like this.This isn't a dealbreaker but it is an awkward issue for me.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR! - GF has made physical changes these past 6 months, while I've supported even though I haven't been a personal fan of, and resembles too much like a guy because of her hair during sex because of her hair which has turned me off physically. Her new side tattoo and dermals also don't look appealing to either. Recently I haven't been able to finish and she asked me if anything is wrong. I told her no but I feel bad for lying and for feeling this way. Everything else in the relationship is great and I love her endlessly. Physical attraction has been the only issue lately making sex rather difficult for me. Am I bad for feeling this way? If this is an issue I should bring up how should I do so and when? This isn't a dealbreaker but it is an awkward issue for me.

519,ca33fu,laurash3,Annoyed with my fiancé’s mother after her “another woman will remark”,"So today I went to my fiancé’s family reunion. Per usual at events my fiancé disappears for most of it, and when I say most I mean like 90% of it. I’m thinking why did I even come when you obviously don’t want to be here And frankly neither do I?

Anyway, at some point they turn on the music for ppl to dance. Mostly the kids run to the dance floor and it’s nearly empty. Now I personally don’t like to dance in front of others unless I’m really feeling myself or it’s crowded. I feel embarrassed. And have some hang ups about being judged and feel off rhythm. But his family lays the pressure on THICK. So I get up and barely two step before sitting down. My fiancé’s mother looks at me and says that I didn’t dance enough (shake my butt enough were her exact words) and that if I don’t do it someone else will. I laugh but she tells me she’s serious. I’m irritated but say nothing because it feels inappropriate to say anything so i just ate the comment. There is a history of infidelity in the past almost 9 years we’ve been together (yes, she’s aware) so hey, not the best thing to say. She was in a bad mood all night but I think she’d have said it regardless. I bring it up to him on the ride home and he barely says a thing. Nerves are grated even more

So I don’t know what to do. Talking to him gave me very little reprieve. Do I bring it up to his mother that I found her comment to be hurtful and unnecessary especially since it was triggered by something as small as dancing? Or do I leave it alone for a more cohesive environment? Like is this a don’t sweat the small stuff kind of situation?",2019-07-07 04:46:12,10,2,relationship_advice
520,ca12x4,MikaylaTheScrub,"I (17F) am starting to “hate” my father (40M) and my father’s family, plus I have a childhood wish that will never ever come true.","Hello, I’m in a bit of a pickle. These past two weeks have been rather interesting because this has never come up before (this distain, at least.)  This whole thing came up during conversation between my teacher and I. 

When I was younger, my parents “divorced” and I don’t think I’ll ever find out what truly happened. When I was younger, I always wished that my parents would get back together, it’s something that I’ve wanted more than anything, to be honest. Hell, even at 17 years ago, over 10 years later, I still sort of wish it today. Today my dad is engaged to a nice lady and my mom is a lesbian who’s been also dating a very nice lady. So I know for a fact that will never happen. Ever since my dad met his fiancé, our relationship changed, it was no longer Dad and I going places, it was now, Dad, fiancé, and I going places. We barely (if hardly) go places by ourselves and that really affects me. My mom and I do stuff together alone and sometimes she brings her girlfriend along, it’s a nice balance. 

The reason why I feel “hatred” or “distain” is that my dad is borderline alcoholic, in my opinion. He always drank when I was younger and I can’t even count the amount of times I’ve seen him with a beer or drink this weekend. I’ve lost count. Earlier this week, I noticed him pulling out a beer at 11:50am and I “pfft”ed. Last night I guess he got pretty drunk cause his fiancé kept scolding him for being hungover, he denied it and said lack of sleep, but whatever, Dad. He drinks too damn much in my opinion. I noticed that I keep trying to put my dad on a high pedestal. I love my dad and he means the world to me, he’s definitely my favorite parent but ever since he’s gotten engaged and his drinking has become more noticeable, I can’t wait to see Mom again. I love being at Mom’s house, I fully decorate my room and call it home. At Dad’s house, I only have 3 posters up, and a few stuffed animals on the shelving. Even though I like staying at Mom’s, my relationship with her is also “spotty” too. She gets mad for no reason at times, she acts scary and yells/scolds me when her girlfriend is around sometimes. She’s done it before with exes too. 

The reason I also “hate” my dad’s family is cause they drink like fucking crazy too! My aunt, drinks and to be honest, I don’t think she’s a good parent to my 11 year old cousin, who even told me that her and other family members got drunk at her birthday party. It made me reminisce and genuinely hope that my dad didn’t drink at my birthday parties. My uncle has tried to get help at AA but I don’t know how they turned out. My cousins will throw parties and just drink and sometimes I’m taken to the parties, it’s absolutely horrendous trying to sleep during those parties. My dad’s birthday is coming up and he wants me to photoshop pictures, I did and most pictures I got of him/that are on his Facebook is alcohol or beer. He’ll “cleanse” his liver once a year or two but he’ll never fully stop. It honestly pisses me off so much to the point where I don’t want to see him. It makes me hate him.

It’s gotten to the point where I’m spending basic time with family, I feel anger, hatred, or just being plain upset near my family or my dad. My dad talks about his wedding and how he wants me there, but to be honest, I planned on being moved out before then and based on how I feel right now, I don’t want to go. He even talks about him having more children (i’m an old child) with his fiancé, he wants me to help raise them and be a second mother. Right now, how I feel right now, I don’t want anything to do with them. More family talk about me graduating and celebrating, I feel like I should ban all alcohol if they do plan on celebrating my graduation, lol. 

I know I would regret later if I just dip out, but I’m just so honestly pissed and upset with the fact that the adults just drink and party, even when they’re in their late 20s-early 40s. My cousins have no interest in it, we all just hide away during parties and rant about the adults in the family. Another thing that stings too, is when I see old pictures of my dad and mom together, it makes me cry and absolutely depressed. I’d basically promised that one day when I do get married and have children I want them to be with two loving parents who have no intention on splitting apart. I’ll never truly know what happened between my parents, but I promise to never have something like that happen to my future family. 

Sorry for the long post. 

TL;DR My dad and his family drink too much, it’s pissing me off and I don’t want to be around them anymore. I also wished that when I was younger, I wanted my parents to get back together. They never will, but I still wish it, slightly. Their relationship has made me realize what I want and don’t want in my future.",2019-07-07 01:00:05,1,5,relationship_advice
521,c9wo39,Halloween_is_best,My (21m) girlfriend (21f) and I broke up because she cheated on me. She's taking it really badly.,"We had been dating for 4 and a half years. It was really good and I don't regret anything. I still love her and want the best for her but...

She cheated on me. She didnt ""cheat"" cheat but she emotionally cheated on me.

We were extremely monogamous people. We constantly raved about how exclusive we were and how we had been high school sweethearts. How our relationship was the best because we loved each other so much.

So when I found out she emotionally cheated on me I was destroyed. Maybe she isn't (I belive she is) as monogamous as me but I just can't take cheating.

Even though I love her and I know she won't do it again, I know she regrets it, I know it was a mistake. I just can't get over it. It's a huge huge deal breaker for me. Any form of cheating.

Hence, I cannot be in a relationship with her anymore.

The issue is, is she's really taking it badly. She has a habit of being really self destructive and self sabotaging so this event is really damaging to her.

Throughout the relationship she was kinda infatuated in me which is why she's taking it so badly.

Since we broke up she's just been self destructive. I'm afraid that she'll ruin her life over this.

I don't want her to feel this pain. I want her to be okay. I tried to go back to her for a month but it was awful. I just couldn't spend more than 2 hours with her without feeling so upset she cheated on me. It took away all the love in relationship and made me feel like I was just mimicking the real thing. 

I just can't go back, but I want to make it easier for her in some way?

She has mental illness and I feel like that contributed to all of this, Im really afraid she will hurt herself.... I can't bare the thought of it.

Is there any way I can make this easier for her? She keeps trying to get in contact with me but I've just ignored it.

Should I just never talk to her again? Should I talk to her eventually?

Is there anything in particular that I can do to help her?

Sorry if this is a long post with a simple answer which is

""ur selfish and just want to feel better about breaking up"" but maybe someone has some novel insight in how I could make it better... I don't know. I'm desperate for any way to ease her pain.

Also in terms of hurting herself, I already called suicide prevention on her. I don't know what happened after that.

TL;DR: my girlfriend of 5 years cheated on me. I have no ill feelings towards her but am not able to continue the relationship.

She's taking it really really poorly and I want to make her feel better in anyway I can.

Edit : she betrayed me and cheated. I don't want to get in to it more than that. I can't go back to her, it's a Deal breaker. Writing about it will upset me too much.",2019-07-06 18:11:09,26,14,relationship_advice
522,ca32zy,IIIQIII,How do I tell my(27m) family they forgot my birthday?,"I feel pretty dumb even asking this and I'm torn between feeling selfish and a depressed. But my birthday was a month ago and since I have small family (2 parents, 2 siblings 1 of whom is married with two kids) we are very active together. We get together frequently for game nights and help each other with house ownership stuff like painting, remodeling, etc. Long story short we are a very close family and whenever anyone has a birthday we go out to eat to celebrate it. 

So my birthday was about a month ago. I got the usual birthday wishes from my family on our whatsapp but due to my busy schedule it never worked to go out to eat. But after that it was just kind of over. No one mentioned going out to eat or trying to schedule anything for it or anything. I didn't want to bring it up and seem selfish or anything but we just celebrated my nephews birthday today and it was a little painful for me. Especially as I've been battling a lot lately with depression and overall been in an extremely dark place in my life.

I don't really know what to do in this situation. I know it was not malicious but it hurts none the less. And I don't want them to feel bad about forgetting my birthday.

As I'm reading over this I realize this is a huge first world problem but it feels important to me so any advice would be nice please and thank you in advance.",2019-07-07 04:44:47,5,2,relationship_advice
523,ca32za,tynike,My boyfriend’s (25) new work friend (F18) insulted me. Looking for advice.,"So wanting some advice about if I’m over reacting or not. A new girl (18) started at my boyfriend’s (25 and we’ve been together for a year and a half, I’m 20) work, everyone including the bf called her the “hot new girl” up until recently he learnt her name (he’s since acknowledged that that wasn’t so cool, also clarified that he thinks she’s hot but not his type of hot... he strictly sees her as a friend). Anyways my bf and her have become friends (he’s only known her for two days) and sit in his car at lunch breaks etc. (he usually sits in his car by himself but she asked if she could come.) This is all good I trust him and it sounds like they get on well. My problem is I found out she saw a photo of me and said something along the lines of “she’s not the prettiest girl in the world what do you see in her”. Also said that his ex is hotter than me. My bf maintains she didn’t mean anything by it, and that she wasn’t being rude, I on the other hand think it was a pretty bitchy thing to say and am a bit mad he’d be friends with someone who talked about me like this? I tried having a calm conversation with him and tried to understand his perspective but he ended up getting pissed at me because I just couldn’t understand how it wasn’t malicious. After a long conversation where I tried to explain how I was hurt by this etc we ended up agreeing on him distancing himself from her... but he still maintains she didn’t mean anything. So yea am I over reacting? Also any advice on what I could do? A part of me wants to confront her as I’m pretty mad that she thinks it’s okay to talk about me like that, but I’m not sure if that’s the best idea. Tia.

EDIT: to clarify, my bf didn’t realise or even take notice of it being offensive until I pointed it out. I just talked to him and he agrees she meant it how it sounded but doesn’t think it’s that offensive. He focused more on the “what do you see in her” as a legitimate question and answered it telling her why he loves me.  I’m just struggling to find a way for him to understand just how insulting it is. He also struggles with empathy which might factor in.",2019-07-07 04:44:40,14,2,relationship_advice
524,c9yak7,RA_throwaway271,My (30f) boyfriend (35m) is very close with his ex and has openly disrespected me a number of times in regards to their relationship. Should I send this text?,"My last post was removed and I was told to post from a throwaway by u/eganist. 

I have been with my boyfriend for almost four years. Throughout this time, he has been close friends with his ex girlfriend and I have felt openly disrespected on a number of occasions. When I began getting upset about their relationship, he started hiding it and lying about it. I have had to go through his phone to find out that they have been in close contact for the past year when he said they had stopped talking. He sees her several times a week and talks to her on an almost daily basis. 

Oh, and she and I have never met. She doesn't even know I exist, and when I have been at his house when she's come over, he has actually hidden my purse and shoes in his bedroom and made me stay in there until she left (happened probably 3 times, and it was only a few minutes as she was either dropping something off or picking something up). This hasn't happened for a couple years because since then our paths have never crossed. He's offered to have us meet recently, but I feel that it is too little too late. He refuses to acknowledge that it is bizarre and disrespectful that he has never even told her he's been dating someone for almost four years. He say's it just ""hasn't come up.""

We have had countless arguments over this, and he's been clear that if he has to choose between her or me, that I can leave. I am planning to send him this final text and then block him after. I wanted to get input to see if this is too harsh or if there's anything I might want to change, or if I should just not send it at all:

Out of respect for our relationship, I wanted to make it crystal clear how I feel.

The issue with being friends with an ex is that it’s not just a regular friend. It is someone you once told you loved them, had sex with, and knew in a romantic capacity. That makes things more complicated and to stay in contact while in a serious relationship with someone else is just inconsiderate and disrespectful. Not only staying in contact with, but staying very close with. It’s not right. But that is neither here nor there. I don’t like it and no one else will either.

That being said, I believe I could’ve been okay with it if things would’ve been handled differently by you. If I had felt like I was being respected, that there was transparency, and that it was treated like any other friendship you have, I truly think I would have felt much differently. Instead, I was openly disrespected by you, as you completely disregarded my feelings on a number of occasions including:

telling her you love her in front of me, talking about how nice her body is right in front of me, butt dialing me while telling her how sexy her pictures were, going to dinner with her for her birthday the day after I had an abortion (during which you abandoned me for no apparent reason and left me to suffer, bleed, and vomit in horrible pain alone the night before), hiding me in the bedroom every time she came over or meeting her downstairs and pretending you were on your way out, hanging out and either just not telling me (because you know I wouldn’t be happy) or blatantly lying to me about it, and telling me countless other lies that minimized the relationship you have with her. By your own admission, you have never even mentioned me to her (someone you’ve been with for nearly FOUR YEARS. Who does that?!)

I take responsibility for believing your words instead of your actions. I should have left a long time ago. It’s not until now that I truly see that you are going to protect that relationship at all costs, even if it means lying to me, hiding me, and doing things you know I wouldn’t be okay with. I will never be able to get past how you’ve treated me when it comes to this. But at the end of the day, you have what was clearly most important to you and it is not my problem anymore. If the next girl wants to play second to an ex girlfriend you can’t let go of, that’s on her. I will never in life be disrespected like this again or stick around with a man who won’t prioritize me in his life. Since you don’t seem to know how to let go of an ex or say goodbye so you can actually move on, this is how you do it. Goodbye.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Despite what it may seem like from the information here, I absolutely do NOT think they are sleeping together or have an actual romantic relationship. Much to my embarrassment, this has driven me pretty crazy and I've scoured his texts, emails, and her social media and have found zero evidence indicating anything like that. In fact, she has been dating other people. With that being said, I think their relationship is still entirely inappropriate and disrespectful towards me, even in the absence of anything physical or romantic between them.",2019-07-06 20:33:16,26,9,relationship_advice

We were a great couple for several years, then his temper started to show, and long story short, it hasnt subsided, As much as it pains to say, he is abusive and i feel like i have become abusive at times too in response. We yell and say mean things, very hurtful things. But he screams, also breaks things, plates, cups, whatever is near. Has made a couple holes on the wall and broken things that are mine out of spite. Basically, i dont think there is a way to salvage this relationship, we hardly talk, and if we do it ends up with annoyance on both sides ar the very least. I want to leave, bc i know this isnt good for me anymore, but i have literally yelled at him we need to break up, and have told him im no longer feel in love, that i dont want to be together, that we need to separate for our own good and he wont accept it. He will also not accept therapy, bc he thinks fixing us is all about me fixing my behavior and this being responsible for the relationship failing or succeeding. 
We have lived together for the past 3 years, neither one of us can afford rent alone, not even a studio, i cant go to my parents house bc theres no room, cant stay w friends as they also live w parents (rent is ridic high) or w their bf.

532,ca1slj,JustCallMeYarr,Traditional Parents vs Unconventional Relationship,"TLDR; I feel stuck between two worlds. 

&amp;#x200B;

I (25F) am an American born to Guyanese immigrants. Guyana is the only English speaking country in South America. For a little over a hundred years it was an extension of the British Empire  and many of its residents were imported from other British colonies from places known as China, Africa and India. My parents are both Indian descent and were born and raised in Guyana. My parents came over to America (Ohio woot woot) before having me and my three younger siblings. Growing up, they kept things pretty traditional at home. Girls are expected to be modest, and pretty much not do anything without parents' permission. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was raised in rural Ohio. I grew up being the only brown girl in my class (literally out of 300 graduating high schoolers I was the only one). I consider myself to be pretty American/independent. I don't know if this is putting it right, but the Guyanese culture is like a hierarchy of submission. I am to submit to my parents, my mother submits to my father etc. If someone ""below you"" does something you don't agree with and you tell them to cut it out, they are expected to. I could list a dozen of these scenarios from my childhood but that's for another post. 

&amp;#x200B;

ANWAYS

&amp;#x200B;

I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend (29M), we'll call him J, for a little over a year. J is absolutely the best. He gives me the emotional support to be myself I don't really felt like I had growing up. He pushes me to be my best and never shames me for any of my interests.  Sounds like I have a healthy, stable relationship, right? That doesn't seem to matter to the Parents. J is white, and is a manager at a Burger King. I'm an RN myself and with J's support I'm applying to programs to get my doctorate in nursing and be a nurse practitioner. I knew my parents wouldn't approve so I kept the relationship from them for a year. I secretly snuck out of my parent's house to visit J almost every night without them noticing. I wanted to be sure I really cared about this guy before introducing him to them, and I do. He is one of the most hardworking people I know and even thought he never went to college, he's intelligent too. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents found out about our relationship and have made it clear they do not approve. I've been staying at his place inbetween my shifts for the past year too. Say I worked two nights in a row, instead of going to my parent's inbetween those shifts I would go to J's instead. He's really made space for me in his home and given me a key , telling me I'm welcome anytime, even if he's not around and I just need a safe space. My parents found out I've been staying with him and we have not been able to have one conversation that doesn't end with me in tears. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been staying at J's the past week and my parents are livid. My dad says I've shamed the family and disrespected them I say I'm 25 and if I want to be with my boyfriend I shouldn't have to explain it to him. It does not mean I love my parent's or my siblings any less. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can I find a happy medium here? Has anyone dealt with this before? I don't think I need to choose between my parents and J, but my parents keep insisting that's what it comes down to.",2019-07-07 02:17:35,6,3,relationship_advice

I met her cousin/BFF today for the first time.. She was travelling and came back yesterday, only lives 5 minutes away from my gf now.. They're really close together.. Always texting while she was away. She has a common name so I didn't think much of it.

Problem is that me and the cousin have quite the history. We started as a hook up 1.5 years ago, I only was attracted to her really at first. She really wanted a relationship and We dated for about 2 months until I basically found out she's a little crazy. We weren't compatible at all. She however got extremely attached. Super messy break up, she threatened suicide and had a few emotional breakdowns at my place. I ended up ghosting her.. When we met today my heart dropped. She didn't react at all because I suspect she already knew who I was, pretty sure my gf shares everything with her. She acted a bit weird however, and I was uncomfortable the entire time. Girlfriend noticed this and left to grab lunch for all of us so we could get to know each other. I desperately wanted to avoid this but gf whispered to me it was important to her and I didn't want to open the floodgates right then and there..

Conversation with her cousin was weird, that's all I can say. It just felt off. She acted exactly how she was when we were together. Touching, talking about REALLY private stuff and sat on my lap and told me we shouldn't tell my girlfriend, because it would only hurt her and she didn't need to know. Attempted to kiss me. I wasn't about to start a fight because I need some time to think this through. Honestly no clue how to approach the subject with my girlfriend..

537,ca1rdd,FlavoredCurious,I (19M) am worried I will never find love again,"Hello everyone.  So back in December, my ex-girlfriend (19F) and I broke up.  At the time, things were extremely toxic and all around, she treated me terribly.  I have been improving myself over the past 7 months and have made changes to my life like going to the gym, meeting new people, and installing some dating apps.  However, I have recently found out that my ex was cheating on me almost during our entire relationship and spread many different rumors about me to other people.  In other words, she basically fabricated the truth and made her seem like less of a terrible person.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I am trying to move on and find it very difficult to do so.  This was my first girlfriend and first kiss.  Despite her being toxic and not nice, I still had feelings for her and they are hard to shake.  We never had sex, but that was only because she was trying to pressure me into it earlier than I wanted to.  I am currently single and feel so lonely without having intimacy in my life like I used to.  It hurts seeing others couples while I am once again single.  I am trying everything I can, like installing the dating apps as mentioned above, but no luck whatsoever.

538,ca2x66,WellInsulatedManatee,I flirt too provocatively with my boyfriend,"My (23) significant other (23), who will be known as SO just informed me he doesn’t like the way I flirt with him. I will say things “Your voice is so deep and sexy when you correct me on ‘X’. I find it distracting” or “Your ass is so gorgeous. People would pay to have an ass like that.” Sometimes more explicit and over the top, but for the most part it’s a text or within the confines of a private bedroom. He just told me it makes him highly uncomfortable and would rather be called cute. To be clear I’m not obnoxious in public because I’m pretty modest around others and I am a firm believer in the adage “lady (or dude) in the streets, but a freak in the sheets.”

Now folks, this isn’t the issue. I have no problem toning it down, calling him cute, and attempting to be more subtle with my flirting. I’m upset because we have been dating for over two years and he just now told me. SO said to me it wasn’t a big deal and I sated I will respect his preferences moving forward, but I’m still upset because I feel like it’s a bad precedent for the relationship. SO told me it was a “small sacrifice for something that makes [me] happy,” but if you’re making small sacrifices with the inevitable large ones that come with a lengthy relationship, that seems like a recipe for disaster. Additionally, I have to break the habit of being direct and over the top with my flirting, which would have been easier at the beginning of the relationship.

Initially I'd like to apologize for all further grammar and spelling mistakes, I'm not a native English speaker and additionally I haven't been sleeping for 24 hours. I won't close my eyes until I post it. 

Since the beginning of June, I've been dating the cutest, the most caring and generally best person who's ever existed on this planet (F 17). I'm clearly in love with her and I love her from the very bottom of my heart. I just can't describe it. The relationship has helped me with my bad self-rating and this month has been the best month of my entire life. Yesterday, she was at my place, and, after hours of kisses and lying together, we've decided to have sex, in both cases for the first time in our lives. From the objective point of view, it sure was great - we've both had sexual pleasure, experiencing it in the first time in our lives. But in the inside, I didn't feel great, I just couldn't define it back then. However, when the night fell, after she went home and I was under way to my friend's place to play some Magic, I've been thinking if it was really me who wanted to have sex, not the hormons inside me who just wanted to get laid and get the pleasure. Then in the tram I came to a conclusion that it wasn't me, and the real me enjoys cooking with her, walking through the countryside with her and exchanging warm hugs with her. I want to protect her as the greatest treasure in this world. She actually takes hormonal medicine because of other, not related reasons, so it really wasn't an option for her to say no when it comes to sex. I came to mind that I, as a person would prefer to rather build a (sorta) platonic relationship, since it's the most beautiful one. Two hours ago, I told my girlfriend (through a chat) about what I feel about this situation. And here it comes - she thought that all this is because of her body being imperfect, that she didn't realize my ""expectations"" in bed, and generally converted all of this into a strong self-rating strike. I've tried to explain that it's absolutely not about it, that it's rather revolving my sexuality, that I love her too much to tell her about her (nonexistent) imperfection. She seems really concerned, I can't physically meet her today. I really love her and I do want her to understand me. I don't want her to abandon me, my life would lose its meaning if she did so in the shadow of such situation.

Here I come, begging for Your help. What should I do? What should I tell her? 

Have a great day/night, people of the Internet!",2019-07-07 08:06:45,5,1,relationship_advice

541,ca4hxs,mnmbelle,Boyfriend is rude to others but not to me or his friends,"My boyfriend clearly loves me a lot. I have been with him for 1.5 years. Whenever we are together, he is sweet and super gentle and always wants to make sure I'm safe and happy. However, there have been times where I felt uncomfortable about his behavior when people not as close to him have come into the picture. I'm looking for advice on what I should do.

He is a bit of an ego-maniac, and sometimes I feel that he often forgets to put a filter on what he says. A few months ago, he told one of my gay friends (just after meeting him) that he didn't like the way he talked and made up phrases such as ""that's litty"". This made me pretty upset. 

Today, we drove past a couple on the street who were begging for money. Though they were wearing  decently clean clothing, they definitely looked to be struggling a bit. They didn't hear it, but inside the car my boyfriend literally yelled ""STUPID PUNKS! GET A JOB!""

As someone who has personally spent a lot of time working with the homeless, this was NOT ok to me. I just don't really know what to do, because he is great to me. He's perfect when there's no one else around, but lately I fear there's another side.

The situation is also a bit hard because we have both given each other really thoughtful, expensive, and meaningful gifts. Additionally, he has Asperger's, so he can get worked up easily and seems to always want attention when there are multiple people around. I don't know how to handle this situation, and have considered possibly breaking up or maybe talking with him.

What are your thoughts?",2019-07-07 08:02:57,14,1,relationship_advice
542,ca4hwx,yvngmyers,Haven't Willingly Interacted of Wanted to Interact with anyone until the age of 18,"I have MDD, PTSD, Anti-Social, and a masochist. I cut myself off from the love of anything and anyone and for 12 years I only ever loved to physically harm myself. I developed little to no relationship with my mother, little brother, big sister. Every friend I have had to work extra to get to know me and I never tried to be outgoing since I found no interest in those types of things that involved love (i.e interacting with other human beings). I am now undergoing therapy to develop the skills that I discarded to be outgoing and show love so that I may understand human interaction and therefore help me survive on my own. I can't seem to know what to do or how to do things when it comes to sacrificing my time for others. I've seen people do it, but it's uninteresting for me sometimes. I can't seem to find the joy in being around people and when I do find the joy it's almost always reciprocated by a dark cavern of negative energy from my past. And the stupidest thing about it is that I can never stay in a room with the people that I'm recommended to meet or talk with because their antics are childish, they lack competence in relation to their age, and the worst pet peeve of mine is when they won't stop talking which is unfortunate since those are the people I have to converse with if I want to have any chance of learning more about interactions. Does anyone know how I can just, talk or do things to foster these relationships?; since I honestly just want to be 100% sure if suicide is better than trying to waste my time fixing a sinking ship",2019-07-07 08:02:49,1,1,relationship_advice

This is my first time being some sort of stepmom.

I can also see that he’s setting his daughter up for her to never settle and meet someone that has much success has he does etc... to the point that she’s a Beautiful young woman about to turn 18 and never kissed a man before because no one is as good as his daddy seems like or I will be up to daddy standard.

544,ca4fl3,FabuliciousKMan,Amazing and Insecure,"I (21M) love my girlfriend (21F) and we’re as happy as can be. Let’s refer to her as Paige. Both of us are busy with school and work, but we make the most of the time we have together. We do most things together whether it be cooking, cleaning, running errands, and even babysitting our nephews. We tell each other how much we mean to each other and are growing as a couple. However, when it comes to her self confidence, it’s a touchy subject.

I had struggled all my life with expressing myself and my emotions. I always felt inability to show these feelings even to my parents and closest friends, because for the most part growing up I was always told not to express them to begin with. After all this I had found someone who helped push me and comfort me to be able to do just that and show her who I am. She has shown me that she’s an amazing person and is genuine. That person is Paige.

She always tells me how she feels and most of the time doesn’t leave me guessing, but when it comes to her body and self-confidence she tends to really show her insecurity of it. She’s beautiful and has the most amazing laugh and smile and I try to tell her all the time so she knows. Many of our coworkers, friends, and customers comment on how beautiful she is. But even then because she’s not “skinny enough” or that she has a little “pooch of a stomach” she says she’s not good enough. She says these things about herself that I try to deny and reassure her about how I feel for her and that’s she’s that amazing person.

I want to be able to help her as she has helped me. What can I do to help her confidence in herself and her image?",2019-07-07 07:52:38,0,1,relationship_advice
545,ca2rlk,Wunderoso,My dating partner is ignoring questions occasionally without any explanation as to why and is short and mostly non-initiative with conversations.,"For instance, she was moving out of her room at her parents house and I ask “are you only removing personal stuff or gutting the room entirely?” Simple stuff, wondering if they are moving stuff to renovate or just so that she can get some personal items out of there and back where she lives. But she completely ignores it. And this happens at least a couple times a day, not even about super personal stuff either. She also doesn’t like to go in depth about her day or how she feels, just overall short... 

I’ve had a feeling for a while now that these are red flags that she is no longer interested, but I’m trying to see how things go for a little longer. We’ve been talking over text for about 3 weeks now, and only recently have we been able to hang out twice since she has been away at work. 

It’s my first real dating experience, and I’m obviously not going to be without my flaws, but it doesn’t feel like there’s little effort on her part to find things out about my life. Does anyone know what I’m dealing with or if there is anything I can do to salvage this? I’m sorry if this is all seems like a bit of panic or too much worry, but I don’t want to commit to a relationship that has no chance. Also sorry for mobile formatting.",2019-07-07 04:06:31,8,2,relationship_advice
546,ca1jbw,AlphaSquad1,Is it enough for two people to want to make a relationship work?,"My gf and I (both 29) have been going out for three years and these last few days everything has fallen apart. I don’t know what to do now. I’m ending things because I think it’s what’s best for both of us but I can’t stand the hurt it’s causing to her and to me. 

We had a slow start and a steady build. We traveled together, fostered a few dogs, she moved in. A few hiccups, but the first major problem came when we started talking about getting married. A close friend seemed to be close to getting married and so my gf was getting anxious about the subject, I thought discussing ideas might help that anxiety since nothing else seemed to. We drastically disagreed on the guest list. she has problems with her immediate family so didn’t want them there but because if family obligations didn’t think she could have other friends/family there if her parents weren’t, so she just wanted to elope. I am a very social person and love my family, so I wanted it to be a big celebration with a bunch of people, but at a minimum a handful of the people closest to me. But that wouldn’t work because if I had family there then she’d have to as well and on and on and on. No attempts at compromise worked and we both felt like we were sacrificing a lot but the other didn’t care about what was important to us. It got so bad I disappeared into my phone/online to escape. Not the most mature, I know, but every time I came out of that there was another fight, another argument, and no reason for me to stay present. 

All thoughts of getting married left me at his point because if a simple issue like this could ruin things so much then we definitely shouldn’t get married. If we really loved each other enough to get married then none of those hypothetical issues should have mattered to either of us, getting married should have been the most important thing. We had worked through so many things up to that point I thought we could manage anything, but I was wrong. 

Eventually she pulled me out of my ass from my escapism and we could sort of start over. Things were better for the last year but we were desperately avoiding the issues that blew things up earlier. We went through a lot in the year after that including me losing my job and a 2.5 week road trip across the US (we loved it). A few days ago we had a stupid little argument and she let me know that she had a 1 year deadline in mind for if we were going to get married or not and the date was next week, but telling me moved it up to now (I already knew she had the deadline but didn’t know when besides ‘summer’). I took the day to think about it and I wasn’t ready for that kind of commitment to her. when we talked that evening I thought we were both on the same page. That we both really loved each other but in the past year we hadn’t really solved our major problems, our relationship hadn’t really grown and improved, that we had differences that were just fundamental to ourselves and weren’t going to change. We cried, we hugged, we talked for hours about things we’d miss and what we hoped for the other, and ended the night playing video games together.

I think our problems stem from her being negative and me being positive. She believes she’s always right and hates peoples, and I strive for empathy and understanding even of those you disagree with. I’m a Christian and I don’t care that she’s an atheist but I care about how much hate she has for Christians in general (me and some of our Christian friends are ‘different’). 

Since then she’s been pleading for a do over, to just forget it ever happened. She says that she can change, that we can work through our problems. But we’ve been working on those issues for the last year with no sign of progress. I’ve never felt the surety that she’s ‘the one’ that I’ve wanted to move forward and she deserves someone who doesn’t have those doubts. I love her and I wish we could work things out but I can’t fight our differences anymore. It seems that two people trying isn’t enough to make anything work.

I hate this so much. She’s started packing up and the house seems so empty. But if we aren’t right for each other and it’s not going forward then we shouldn’t waste our time. Am I doing the right thing here?",2019-07-07 01:49:16,1,3,relationship_advice
547,c9yr0l,yummycookiesxoxoxo,"My boyfriend [24/M] says that if I’m [26/F] pregnant, he’s going to cheat on me as many times as he can before the baby is born. Please help","We’ve been together for almost five years, and have lived together for three years. He’s 24, I’m 26. When we met, he was 19 and a virgin, and I was 21 and I was not a virgin. He was always angry about my sexual past, to the point that we actually took a break so that he could get his “number up” so that his number could be closer to my “number”. He is also absolutely convinced that I cheated on him early on in the relationship and that’s a huge reason why he’s wanted to do that (when we first met I was a bad person, I’m not gonna lie about that. My boyfriend and I lived four hours away, we actually met online, and yes I was still flirting with other people online and sending nudes. I was a fucking idiot at 21 and what I did haunts me to this day) he cheated on me to get back at me for that (although I swear I really never cheated on him in real life, just internet stuff which I regret horribly). Long story short, I’m to the end of my rope about making our relationship work. My period is late, and I was asking him what we should do if I’m pregnant. He said that he needs “to go out and have sex with as many women as I can before the baby is born” and I said “what the fuck, why??” and he said “because I won’t be able to once the baby is born” and I was like “wow are you serious?? I would leave you then” and he’s like “wow so you would want the baby to grow up in a broken home?” And I ended this whole discussion by rolling over and going to sleep because I was exhausted. It just makes me feel like our entire relationship is a joke. So what then, if I’m not pregnant, does he still want to go out and fuck a bunch of people? I’m so lost, I hate my life. Maybe there’s nothing worth saving anymore. I just don’t know what to do. I followed him to the ends of the earth, I haven’t had any job or friends or coworkers in three years I am so lonely, I did it to move to be with him, but he’s so controlling and petty sometimes and I just hate my life right now 

**tl;dr** if I’m pregnant then my boyfriend wants to go have sex with as many women as he can before the baby is born because it will be his “last chance to do it”. I feel sick to my stomach. What if I turn out to not be pregnant? Does he still want to go have sex with other women? I feel so lost and depressed, why am I even with him if that’s the case?? I don’t know what to do",2019-07-06 21:13:12,30,8,relationship_advice
548,ca4e8v,Yusake90,(28M) My really close friend(27F) is going through some stuff and I fell bad for leaving her in her home.,"I have a girlfriend (27F) and I have been with her for the past 7+ years. Today I went to a friends bbq and seen a really close friend (27F) of mine that I haven’t seen a while. She rents a room in very poison setting where she doesn’t feel safe. Her life has been hard, to the point where she tried to commit suicide a few weeks ago. Also she’s upset for being oblivious for not taking me when she could’ve in the past. 
The party turned out to helping this girl which I didn’t mind because I still do care for her. She’s a close friend of mine and a family friend that I very much have feelings for her. My brothers and I promised her that we would be there for her because she has nobody for support where she’s living. Funny enough to find out she lives 10min away. 
This friend confessed her feelings to me, telling me how she felt like she didn’t love herself enough to be with me and when she found out I had a girlfriend she kept her distance away. I felt thankful that she told me that because I would’ve married her if we were together. She did kiss me, I didn’t kiss her back and I told her that it’s not fair my girlfriend. But I held her and told her “we, my family is here whenever you need us”. 
Fast forward, we offered to drive her home and to checked out her living situation. We installed a camera in her room and told her to keep her door closed at all times. Basically help her feel safe in her own room. She asked me to sleepover because she didn’t feel safe. I had to decline although she promised that she wouldn’t attempt anything. 
I’m in my home now but I feel really bad for not staying. But I know if it was my gf asking another man to stay then I would not have liked that. I did the right thing right? Should I visit her in the morning, making sure she’s ok? How do I tell my gf all of this. She wasn’t there but I feel like if I tell her that she tried to kiss me and wanted me to stay over then it would make unnecessary problems between both women. I may seem like I’m protecting my friend but I feel like right now, we need her to know that she has supporters to get through. Her life is really bad, like really bad and she has nobody. My friends mother will connect her with medical help soon.",2019-07-07 07:46:45,1,0,relationship_advice
549,ca1i2e,eggggggggggsssss,How to break up with a partner that's showing red flags of being abusive?,"(Alt account because partner knows my main)

I've been with my current partner for about 2 months now and they are starting to show signs of being psychologically and emotionally manipulate to me and others. In groups, they instantly take initiative and end up throwing a tantrum if we don't do what they want (go to a cafe etc). 

They order me around by saying stuff like 'You're doing this' or 'You have to do this' and, if I try to politely refuse by saying something along the lines of 'Sorry, I don't want to', then they get angry and start yelling. They also say they don't like my friends and have tried to stop me making plans with them or talking to them.

I'm generally a calm person, and it takes a lot to get me angry. However, there have been multiple occasions where I've had to leave conversations with them because I'm worried about offending them if I go over the edge.

They constantly ask me for money/snacks, and act like I owe things to them all the time. I realized a few days ago that I no longer harbor feelings for them and I've considered breaking up with them since. 

The reason why I haven't: They're depressed and have had thoughts of self-harm, etc. I really don't want to be what pushes them over the edge, as I'm terrified of what they can do. I know if we broke up, they'd be no chance of us remaining friends and it could really hurt them. They threatened suicide if I ever broke up with them, and I truly care for their wellbeing.
I see them everyday thanks to work/college environments and I can't just disappear from their life overnight.


How do I break up with them without making them upset? Should I even end things, if it would cause harm to their wellbeing?
Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: Current partner has been showing red flags of being manipulative, however they are severely depressed and have threatened suicide if we ever ended things. If I broke up with them, how would I do it without upsetting them?",2019-07-07 01:45:40,4,3,relationship_advice

Are individual practices unrelated to our exclusive relationship enough to break up or am I missing something entirely?,"First time poster, long time lurker. I have been with Erick for about 2 years and we have had a great relationship full of laughter and great communication. We share similar activities in being active, don’t have issues when I’m over and doing chores, have met each other families and friends. On several instances, we had spoken about how our religions are similar. I’m not a practicing Muslim but my close family members are, he never portrayed Catholic practices but his mother is devout. One evening, Erick claimed how the world hates Muslims and how if he had kids, he would never name them a Muslim name. My name is Muslim so I called him out on that and how Muslims have gotten a bad rap bc of certain isolated events; he shouldn’t generalize billions of people. He apologized for getting that impression out and I thought the subject was closed. I mentioned a day later we should talk about having kids since our relationship met many other milestones. A couple days later, after keeping quiet to himself, he called me to tell me he had thought about it and he could not be with me because my Mom and brother fast, even though I don’t. I was confused and hurt but he did not budge and kept claiming we “view the world differently”. He didn’t want to have kids with any Muslim lineage. Our relationship never had religious issues in that I never practiced or ever implied he would have to participate in my family practices. I had visited his parents and didn’t have a problem holding hands for a Xmas prayer. 
After many circular discussions, he states he does love me. At this point he wants time to wrap his head around the religious issues. I don’t see any issues and am wondering what have I missed? How can I communicate to this person I love that I would never have religious issues with him? Is there another reason I cannot see for the breakup? Is it worth salvaging? How do you move forward?

We’ve been talking daily about random stuff, when we’re sad, I’ve been helping her with classes because I’m good at math (we’re in bio engineering) and this kind of stuff. There’s this other guy who’s in my course too, and she talks with him too about less serious stuff because he’s kind of the stupid guy of the course, she told me many times she finds him to be way too stupid.

Anyway, we (me and the other guy who I’ll call V) went to a party this night with N and some friends of her who later split up so it was me, V, N and another friend of N. As the night goes on, N and V keep sticking together leaving me basically alone other than for random stuff like her asking me to hold her cigarettes or whatever, so for 4 hours they didn’t even bother to talk to me while they kept dancing together and when I tried to initiate any conversations or joined them while they were dancing they didn’t consider me at all.

Now, I’ve had problems trusting people due to a failed relationship (got cheated on) and a 4 years long friendship that ended because of reasons that I don’t want to explain.

I explained her why I really don’t like hugs and cute things, basically telling her that I don’t want to get close to people and even if I wanted to get close it’s really hard for me, and she asked me to believe her while saying that she cares about me and that she wants me to get close to her. I told her that I’d try, and it resulted in being totally ignored in today’s parties.

I might have left any details out because I’m tired, so feel free to ask anything, I really don’t know what to do and I kind of panic when I’m in these situations because I was in a comfort zone when I avoided getting close to people and now this comfort zone disappeared.

I also have a tendency of getting to know people and becoming “secondary”, almost forgotten. It’s a problem on my end, I guess, I just can’t figure out what’s wrong with me otherwise I’d try and fix it.

554,ca2mzs,throwaway720162,How do I come clean to my friend after lying about my age for a year??,"(Obligatory I’m on mobile and this is a throwaway account so nobody I know finds this)

Tl:dr at bottom

So I(16f) met a friend(19f) online about 2 years ago (we’ll call her Mary), I wasn’t expecting to actually become so close with Mary but now we meetup every week and are she’s introduced me to the rest of her friend group who I’ve become close with as well. Here’s where the issue is, Mary is about 3 years older than me and so is the rest of her friend group. When I first started talking to Mary everything I said was super vague (cause we started chatting online) and she just assumed I was about her age. I never actually bothered to correct her because she was always so nice and I didn’t want to lose her friendship over it (I’m aware of how dumb that was) so about a year ago Mary realized I was younger than she assumed and asked my age.  I panicked and said I was 17, a year older than I actually am. When I said that she made a joke about how she felt a bit awkward about the age gap and apologized if she ever made me uncomfortable (Mary is like my big sister and she’s never done that but she was upset that she hadn’t realized sooner) after she said that I felt like it would be even worse to correct myself so I kept with it. Now normally I would figure out a way to come clean, but I don’t know how this time and for my 18th birthday Mary wants to take me to a super big event in the states I’ve wanted to go to for years (we’re from Canada). She keeps on referencing it for next year and keeps talking about buying our tickets as soon as they go up, but these are super expensive tickets and I don’t want her buying mine as a gift when I literally can’t go. This whole thing has been making me feel super bad and I have no idea how to come clean about a lie that’s been happening for over a year. I’m very aware I’m the asshole for lying, I just don’t want to lose such an amazing friendship over something I said and was too afraid to correct.

555,c9vpiv,DanishPastry6,"Asexual people in relationships - how did you do it? I'm [23F] a sex-repulsed ace, would like a relationship, but don't know how to go about it.","Long time lurker here. Saw a post in here about relationships and asexuality, so thought I'd bite the bullet and ask.

&amp;#x200B;

I \[23F\] would love to have a long-term relationship. The trouble is, I'm asexual. I know there's a spectrum, some ace people are fine with sex, but I find it physically repulsive. Dating apps (both straight and LGBT+) are therefore off-limits because there's the completely reasonable expectation that relationship = sex. I can't go on Bumble or Tinder and say 'sorry, I can't fuck you'. Similarly for most dates. It's not something you say on the first date - coming out to someone I barely know, when I'm barely out to most of my friends/family, is not something I'm comfortable with. But I also understand it's the sort of deal-breaker that needs to be talked about early to avoid wasting anyone's time. So I don't know how to approach it, basically.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I go about finding someone when I can't offer them that basic part of a relationship? Any asexual people on here who have managed it, any advice would be greatly appreciated.",2019-07-06 16:49:02,36,14,relationship_advice
556,ca4amh,Username93749,I need to know how to move on after breaking up with my ex-BF (M20),"Sorry for any grammar, spelling and formatting problems. Im typing on my phone. 

My (20F) BF and I dated for about a year and a half. It was initially a good breakup because we decided to stay in touch and maybe even work out our differences and make things work in the future.

QUICK BACKSTORY -
We broke up because I said I wanted to. Why did I want to?
- I always felt like his 3rd 4th or even 10tg priority at times (its fine if he is focusing on studies but he would actually always put gaming and friends first.)
- I felt that he was emotionally cheating on me (we both graduated from the same school and he would always talk to this one girl and hide all her texts and snaps. When we saw her together, she hugged him by putting her legs and arms around him (the way you would hug your BF after seeing him after a while))
- He and I had different financial goals
- He is a lost soul. I planned everything for him with his parents' (where he would go to uni, which program, etc.)
- He is very selfish and only called/texted me when he wanted something from me (I was bedridden for 3 days because I was sick and he never asked me how I was feeling and didn't do anything for me eventhough he is a 10min car ride away from me during holidays) 
- He always thought that if I cancelled a plan it was just me making an excuse and not because there was an actual reason (I had a broken knee and he knew it. I was at his place cuz the doc said no stairs and my dorm had stairs so I went to his and told him I couldn't go out to his fav ramen restaurant that night because of my knee and he said ""Good Excuse"" 
- Gaming
- He lowered my self confidence and blamed everything that went wrong in his life (even if he lost while playing a game) on me. 

END OF BACKSTORY 

Now, it's been about 2 months since we have broken up and all my friends are very happy for me because they all hated him. I want to stay away from him but it's hard for me too because although I have moved countries and am literally half way across the world from him, we snap and talk everyday. I try to keep my distance but idk why it's hard to. 
I end up trying to know what he's doing and if he's dating that other girl or something... Maybe because deep inside I care? 

Idk what to do... Reddit help me understand what I can do to get over my ex! 

TLDR: I can't help talking to my ex. I know I should stop but I need to know how to move on in a healthy manner. Please help!",2019-07-07 07:30:53,1,1,relationship_advice

Me and my GF started dating around two years ago. And we started being intimate after aprox 2 months. At first everything was wonderful and I thought we were a perfect match. But after we moved in, things started to be a little shaky and now after 2 years we are intimate once every 2 weeks or so...

We love each other very much.. but for me the sexual tension is starting to be unbearable.

Also we had many discussion about this but apparently nothing has changed.

What should we do ?

Later edit:
 in general it feels like a great relationship we do lots of thing together in and out of the house, including taking walks making road trips and house work in general like cleaning the house or sharing house duties.

I did ask her if there is something wrong that I have done down there and she said that while we are doing it it is awesome, the only problem is getting there.

560,ca2kf5,travlr724,On and off fwb cheated on her bf of 6 months with me when I came to visit.,"Throwaway for obvious reason. A little backstory; I (23M) have been friends with (21F) for about 2 years. After about a year of solid fwb I moved across the country for school. We stayed in contact and remained friends. Well about 5 months ago she came to visit me for my bday and confessed that she was in love with me and assumed I felt the same way. She told this to me as I was driving her to the airport. This caused a bit of a bump in our friendship as I noticed she was being a bit awkward about things (which was understandable). 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago when i went to visit my hometown for 2 weeks. She had been trying to convince her bf to hangout with me and he was saying no due to the extent of our past relationship. After a few days into my vacation she texts me and invites me to a club with her friends. I end up going there and no more than 5 minutes into catching up she lets me know I can stay over. Maybe she was being friendly and caring or she knew what was going to happen (or a little bit of both?) We end up taking an Uber to her house after drinking for 3 hours, go wonder around her neighborhood drunk and smoke some bud. Mind you, this whole time she was feeling up on me. We get back to her place about 4am and lay in bed together. I’ll spare you the details but we started, she said she felt guilty but then 30 seconds later unleashed on me in the best way possible then said when I’m around she just can’t handle herself. After I got back she kinda stopped talking to me which is reasonable but why is that? Our relationship was never toxic and we always encouraged and built each other up.

Now I understand morally what happened was fucked up but all night she kept saying how her bf was bad with money, did a lot of drugs, etc. Along with me venting, I guess my question is why did she stop talking to me and should I just forget about the situation? Also am I being naive to love? I have never been in love so I don’t really understand the feelings that she felt.",2019-07-07 03:43:50,3,2,relationship_advice
561,ca5qxh,TA_over9000,"What's the best way to have a consistent amount of affection/sex from a woman (me 35M, her 24F)?","I am in a relationship, and what I'm going to describe has been present in most of my relationships, if not in all. Let's start by establishing that this question goes for romantic relationships where 2 people are in love (or around that area), and you could say living together, because that emphasizes this behavior I think, but well, this has happened when I've been on relationships not living together as well.

I'm in a relationship where there's a lot of love, and affection. But I've observed that while in this scenario I am consistent with my sexual desire and my affection giving, she is not.

My explanation is that affection and sexual desire is a constant in men, but when it comes to women they are conditioned by their mental/emotional state. For instance, if I have a stressful day at work, the best for me is to give and receive affection, and to have sex (this part maybe not always, but the affection yes). When she has a stressful day at work, she becomes more distant and sex is off the table. This also adds to the fact that women have strong hormonal cycles that can mess with their sexual desires and emotions quite a lot as well. She can be for days without much desire and out of the blue become a sex bomb for a couple of days.

So this is leading to this situation when I feel the relationship is unbalanced and I'm feeling somehow inferior because I give but I don't receive that much at times. She doesn't reject my affection but when I give and I don't receive too much I feel like a nuisance, and also I lose confidence in myself (even when she calls me beautiful constantly and honestly I think I look the best since we met, I workout and all that). She is living some stressful times at the moment at work and I really want to be there the best way possible, but I am a bit lost. What I've been considering is to give more space to maybe make her come to me more often and maybe become more desirable, but I'm afraid that can lead to us becoming more distant.

I almost posted this on /AskWomen because I am pretty much looking for behaviors that could make me more attractive for a woman, in this case my girlfriend. Meaning attractive as a complete being. More desirable, to inspire more affection, to be more wanted in general. But when I read this text I think it's obvious I'm asking for relationship advice. I hope I didn't look like a dude trying to force her to do anything, I don't. I can breathe in the air when she is not up for certain things and I don't push her in anyway in that cases. But being young, living together, and having sex once a week seems a bit out.

I'd like, if I may, to ask for positive and constructive advice on this as it is. I say this because I know some posts trigger the kind of responses that say this relationship is not working and we should break instead of adding information into the topic itself. I may sound a bit depressed or have portrait the situation as very unbalanced, but keep in mind that, as I said in the beginning, there's a lot of love and affection in this relationship generally. It's the inconsistency at times what I'm trying to deal with.

Thanks!",2019-07-07 11:13:15,5,0,relationship_advice
562,ca49o7,Celestial-moon27,My(25) bf(24) got drunk and flirted with his sisters best friend,"Idk how to start this tbh as I’m still kinda drunk myself.. my bf of 5 years never drinks and today, well yesterday, was his sisters wedding party thing and for the occasion he decided to drink. At first everything was good, he was fine and coherent but I lost him after awhile and when I found him again he was talking to some chick ( I’ll call her Beth) and I didn’t mind but he didn’t acknowledge me when he saw me so I went outside and did my thing. I went to check on him again after some time and he was still talking to beth but was more drunk and his sister told me to take him away as she looked at them both in a odd way, and as I approached them he extended his arms and I assumed for a hug but as I got closer I saw it was meant for Beth, they were both discussing their dreams and decided to hug. His sister again said to take him because he was drinking too much. Since it’s his first time I didn’t mind the lowkey flirting that was going on, that  is, until I saw him keep hugging her and then his other sisters friend,( I’ll call her Jan) she was also drunk and was being flirty with him too, kept clinging to him and at one point told me to go look for our son and she’d watched over him because at that point my bf was very drunk. When I came back, i saw her hugging him and the other chick as well, they were way too close to him and I did feel uncomfortable but didn’t say anything. At this point my bf was slurring his words and I tried taking him to the bathroom and in the bathroom he said he wanted Jan to suck his dick and I tried to ignore it thinking he’s drunk and it’s just the alcohol talking but both these girls were very handsy and flirty with him and he did nothing to stop it but I’m a sort of confident girl and Jan was flirting with two other guys as well so I didn’t think too much of it, after a while he started to blackout and Jan kept wanting to take care of him and take him to the bathroom and she did. They were alone for about 2 minutes or less and someone told me she was in the bathroom with him, with the door closed so I went to go see but she just walked out and I didn’t think anything of it or rather tried not to think too much of it but as the night ended, Jan said that my bf groped her breasts and was crying about it but she said that he did it when she was in the room with our son but thing was, he was in the bathroom, throwing up and I was with him so idk what to think of everything. My bf has cheated before but we’ve worked through that but now, I’m at a loss on what to think and I feel numb, like I want to cry but I can’t feel anything and I just wanted an outside perspective on this situation.

563,ca1ccm,Throwaway236464,I think my (25F) boyfriend (25M) has a crush on his friend,"Hi everyone. My boyfriend of six months always seems flirtatious with his female friend of a year+. He tends to pay more attention to her than his other female friends in the group and talks about her the most with me. He also seems slightly bothered by the fact that she is recently engaged. He always claims he doesn't like her fiance. I told him one day, ""Why does it bother you so much? It's not your problem!"" And he said I was right and that it wasn't his problem and he just doesn't like her fiance. Everytime her fiance is brought up he goes, ""F*ck that guy."" He invites her to friend outings and seems upset when she can't go. He told me one day that he hadn't seen her in forever and he sounded like he wanted to. All of this is very covert, but I tend to notice little things. He isn't outrageously flirtatious, but the undertones of his friendship with her bother me. Also, he has a type (asian and short) which she is. Am I just being praranoid and overreacting? What should I do?

It was an awful waste of time that took me over a year to heal from. But now I have to take shit from this guy at my school (let's call him Steve) that picked up on the fact that I liked this other guy John(fake name) and now won't stop bringing it up around other people. I think he knows it bothers me. He's always like ""I can't believe you liked that white guy"" or ""I have someone else you can like."" (Then giving a list of names) Or ""I can't believe you like that white guy"" as if I STILL have feelings for him. A lot of people in my grade suspect I liked John but I never actually confessed my feelings so I still have a bit of leverage. 

I can always say it never happened.

But even so, people will still go with their assumptions and it's annoying and embarrassing whenever Steve brings John up. I have so many bad memories with John that caused me to go downhill mentally. I got my first gray hair from that mother fucker. And I don't need Steve reminding me of it. 

How do I reply to Steve whenever he brings it up?

I've thought of things varying from your simple ""fuck off"" to a speech about how obsessed he seems to be with me but nothing seems to be the right fit. He's the type to laugh and say it was a joke to save face. I've defended myself in the past and he's said to me ""why are you getting so defensive unless you like him.""

My little bro (19m) has been hitting a rough patch with his girlfriend (20f we’ll call her Kate) and I am somewhat caught up in it and would like advice on what to do, say, not do, etc. 

They have been together for about 2.5 years and have never had sex. They waited over a year to kiss even...this was all because of my brother not wanting to (none of us know why, I think he’s too scared to though). Kate has anxiety and idk if it has anything to do with this but she never felt comfortable telling him that she wanted to kiss and fuck him, and never urged him to. 

Last weekend, he was going to sleep in her family’s camper with her in the same bed for the first time. Well he chickened out and made up some bullshit excuse and she thought he wouldn’t because he was disgusted with her or something and that’s why he wouldn’t fuck her. 

Anyways, they had three other dates and activities planned after that incident, but she cancelled all of them and stopped talking to him. The thing is, she is our friend (they were both our friends in our friend group before they started dating) and is now burdening us with the cancellations. We had to change plans and people for the plans which cost us all money. 

She has been posting very sly messages to him publicly on Facebook but making them seem like they are generalized statements and has been sending snapchats to me, directed at my brother flipping him off and petty stuff like that. 

The straw that broke the camel’s back here was that she made a dog indirectly at him in a group chat he wasn’t in, but later joined and saw the message. 

He called her a bitch and broke up with her then and there. 

The issue here is that she is my friend and they are both deeply tied into our friend group. I am in a very rough position here because he has been taking his anger out on me and we are currently not talking. I am in huge trouble right now as well because he has been trying to blame me for all of their relationship problems and has convinced my parents that I am the root of their problems. 

I have no way to prove anything, so I don’t even know where to start. Is there anything I can do that doesn’t involve talking to my brother or intervening too much into their relationship or at least, what was their relationship?",2019-07-07 01:26:27,2,3,relationship_advice

Throughout my high school career, I was always a bit introverted and never really put myself out there. To complicate matters, I had just moved to the school and didn’t know anyone. 
In junior year however, I found a girl that I really liked, let’s call her Alexa (F 18). I really liked Alexa. I thought she was wayyy out of my league. As luck would have it, she was in most of my classes as well. I saw her often, talked to her often (despite myself), and was completely enamored with her. As much as I tried, I could never leave my introverted self behind and actually ask her out - and she was eventually asked out by another friend of mine.

Side note: this friend is one I made also in Junior year. He also had a major crush on Alexa and made moves that I didn’t and got her. He’s a great guy, and I totally support their relationship and they are such a perfect couple. 

Fast forward to end of senior year: a close friend of mine [lets call her K (F 18)] who had always been by my side admitted she liked me. I’ve always had a soft spot for her because she was one person that had always stood by me, she made me feel welcome in the school, she even introduced me to some of her friends and just generally made my life heaven. 

We’ve been talking now for a couple of months and I’m afraid that I don’t really like her as much as I probably should. I remember how I felt (and still feel) about Alexa and with all honestly, I don’t feel the same way about K. We go out sometimes and we talk, and sometimes conversations feel a little flat. I haven’t talked to her about it because I’m afraid it’ll hurt her and I really don’t know how to approach the topic. At the Same time, I don’t want to play with her feelings. We’re not together or anything, but, tbh, she’s probably just waiting for me to ask her out. I still like K, but not as much as Alexa. Is a bird in hand worth two in the bush?


TL;DR: I don’t like K (who likes me) as much as I love Alexa (who is in a committed relationship). Should I still pursue a relationship with K?

anyways i met someone else and he’s really sweet. boy number two is a great older brother to his litter sister and loves kids. i’m very physically attracted to him, and he treats me extremely well. the only thing is we are very different. we have different interests and outlooks on life. he also talks abt himself a lot. we have different ambitions and goals for life too. like he produces music and stuff while hair dressing while im at a four year uni. bottom line is personality wise i fit better and enjoy boy number 1 more and i’m sorta stuck on him. but this boy is willing to commit and give me the security id like.

i’m just conflicted and don’t know what to do :// i feel like i should move on but i’m stuck on boy 1. but i feel like by doing so i’m missing out on an amazing guy who will treat me right.",2019-07-07 03:32:39,7,2,relationship_advice
574,ca2g1c,johnwick8496,How do I regain lost trust?,"Hey all, this is a long read because I’m hurt and my mind is jumbled. I just wanted to talk to someone who has had their trust betrayed in a marriage and how they went about it afterwards. Every situation differs based on the offense of course but I want to know where to start. For clarity I will say that my wife did not cheat on me and I know this undoubtedly. 
 
 
 
 The BLUF is that I had accidentally stumbled upon a secret email while using her laptop.  she was using it to make an anonymous Instagram to talk to a guy she used to crush on in college. For the record, we live 700 miles away from where she went to college at so I am not worried about them meeting up or whatever. There was no emails sent and no messages sent on the Instagram, but she followed that guy and that guy only on there. My only finding was there was message in the “Drafts” folder that was not going to a recipient that was dated September of last year. I’m butchering it but it said “I have a crush on you, I’m a female don’t worry, I used to go to college with you and I wanted to know if you had a crush on anyone when you were in school. This is the only message you’ll receive from me”.  
 
 
 
It sounds so fucking stupid considering we’re adults and we live so far away. Although I am slightly upset at that draft email, I’m really just angry at the response I got when confronting her. I found this email while talking to her on the phone on her ride home from work. I rarely use her laptop and only did because I couldn’t find my laptop charger. I opened the history tab to find a tab I accidentally closed off of and I saw the email that wasn’t her personal email. When I asked, she pretended to not know what it was. The email address consisted of her first name initial and college graduation year, so I knew she knew what it was. As I furthered into the investigation of the email and the Instagram, she said she probably made it for our mutual best friend (for some reason she thought that would be a good excuse). I told her that made no sense why she would make it for her friend and follow some random guy (with my wife’s initial and graduation year as the username). She hung up the call and when I called back, she was crying and saying she was sorry and that it was actually her. I was irate that she had lied to me about it instead of being honest with me from the start. 
  

 
I asked her why she did this and she said that it was a stupid idea she had late at night one day and that she never went through with it (which i do believe because she clearly did not expect me to stumble across this and therefore didn’t clean her evidence up). She said she lied because she was scared to make me angry (which lying only intensified it severely). 
 
 
She seems very authentic about how she wants to make things right but once my trust is hurt it’s hurt for the long run. That lying she did showed me how deceptive she can be and I’m not sure how to even start getting past it. It’s like she’s a different person than I know now. We are on talking terms but I’m sleeping in the bed alone and taking time to get my thoughts together. I don’t know exactly where to go from here. I still love her very much and I absolutely want to avoid a divorce until I’ve fought my soul out. I’m thinking of getting us a marriage counselor to help us get back on track. This whole thing just seems stupid but I was raised to be honest and when someone lies to me, it absolutely wrecks my confidence in them.  
 
 

 
 
Again, thank you to anyone who reads all of this and know that your input is valuable to me.",2019-07-07 03:29:57,6,2,relationship_advice
575,c9dwlr,Throwaway99d58aw,[Update] Wife started to hate me and our kids out of a sudden and now she left us,"A lot of people seem to care and I got a ton of encouraging messages, so I will post an update for you.

We live in northern Europe, for those that asked.

&amp;#x200B;

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c8kusg/wife_started_to_hate_me_and_our_kids_out_of_a/)

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for everyone that gave me their advice. A lot of you have assumed schizophrenia or the rare Capgras delusion. Some of you assumed she was cheating which is something I won’t even address.

Thinking about it, Capgras really fitted the symptoms but I couldn’t just accept that, still hoping she was somehow fucking with us or that it was something mild and temporary and I just overreacted.

After they took her in, i drove to the mental institute to give an exact explanation of what happened in the last week. The psychiatrist assumed some sort of schizophrenia. They told me they will look after her and I should go home to my children. I felt like i was drunk the entire time, I couldn’t close a single eye at night.

The psychiatrist called me yesterday evening and asked me to come to her office. I left my children with their grandparents and drove for what it felt like an eternity.

She told me straight up that she strongly assumes that its Capgras. She never saw a case of Capgras before but it fits everything she gathered. She explained to me how the past 2 days went down.

My wife arrived there, being extremely hostile. She was put in a 'safe room' where she couldn't hurt herself. She calmed down after a couple of hours and the psychiatrist was able to talk to her. The good news was, that she quickly opened up and explained to her what she thinks. She 'knows' that her family and most of her friends have been swapped by clones. She assumed that we, 'the clones', have sent police officers to get her and that she was scared of what we might do to her. She flew in the first place because she felt that we might attack her but mostly to get some space. She still isn’t sure if the 'clones' are malicious or not. That explains why she was distrusting me and always searched for some signs in me and the kids. My wife said that we act exactly like the real ones and how perfect our disguise was, but she knew that we aren’t real because she didn’t feel any love towards me or the kids or her own parents. Writing this down feels like a lance piercing through my chest.

She also told her how she was trying to hide her distrust of us, because she couldn't be sure if we know that she knows that we aren’t the real 'we'. Her delusion that we’ve been swapped came to her 1 day before I noticed it. 10 days ago. She woke up, looked at me and knew that I wasn't the same anymore, not the real one. Same with the kids, her parents and her friends. She hadn’t had those thoughts before.

She asked the psychiatrist if she knows who swapped us or why it happened or if this happens often. She tried to avoid answering her question because she wasn’t sure how my wife would react if she gave in or took her out of her delusion. My wife asked her when she can get out again, the psychiatrist asked her if she wants to get out and she answered that she’s ok being here. It gives her some comfort being with professionals and she now has time to think. It helps that my wife is a nurse and that she respects doctors a lot.

The psychiatrist explained to me, how they will try to slowly deconstruct her delusion and that it can take a short or a very long time until she fully recovers. She explained to me that it’s possible that she might never truly recover. But the fact that she opened up about it and doesn’t necessarily feel scared is a good sign. Im still not allowed to see her as it could make her panic. She apperas to be completely clear of mind about everything else. She knows names, dates, places, facts and everything she knew before. Only the thought that we aren’t the real ones is now a fact for her. Now I wait, till they have some good or bad news of how she develops.

Writing all of this down really helped me. I’m trying to wrap my head around this situation and im mostly scared for her and the children. I can’t hide how distressed I am and that my wife isn’t at home so I explained to them that she is in a mental hospital and she has to recover. The 4yo doesn’t really understand but the other two took it surprisingly well. It helps that they heard all those morbid stories my wife told them from the hospital i guess. They asked me  when they can see her and i told them that i dont know, but i hope it will be soon. I havent felt this empty and i dont know if i should be sad or angry. fuck

Thanks to everyone here that helped me. I feel like im in a waiting room at the dentist. Its so surreal. I feel better knowing what the problem is, but worse not knowing when it ends.",2019-07-05 09:18:54,323,7402,relationship_advice
576,ca46lt,throwaway679285,"Should I attempt to ask my bestfriend if she would date me eventhough we are both in lengthy, steady and decent BF/GF relationships with other people.","So all 4 people in this post are around the age of 23. Me and my girlfriend have been dating for about 3 years while my bestfriend and her boyfriend have been dating for a little less than 2 years. All of us met at the same college.

Me and my best friend have know eachother for 5 years. However there has never been a period of time where both of us were both single. She had another boyfriend before her current SO. Plus I wasn't sexually attracted to her at first. In the last 2 years we have become extremely close, talking to eachother about anything and becoming borderline inseparable. We complain to eachother about things our SO's do that piss us off and confide in eachother when something is wrong before we tell our SO's about it. We have extremely similar senses of humor and make eachother laugh constantly. We even talk about if we were both not married by the age of 40 that we would marry eachother and then go into details about the wedding. She just feels like the perfect person to be in a more serious relationship with. Both of our families have said that we would make the perfect couple. Her mom has even told me that we should be dating while she was with her current boyfriend. The feelings for her have grown so much in the last 2 years and I want to just cuddle with her and tell her how much she means to me.  

I would also be lying if I didn't say, I have developed a sexual attraction towards my bestfriend in the last year. I think this developed because of talking about our sexual experiences. From talks I have learned that her only 2 sexual partners she has had, have not been adequate. I want to try to give her better sexual experiences. I am not saying I am amazing at sex or that I will blow her mind away but I know that I am more selfless in bed and more adventurous than her current SO. I want her to to have better experiences with sex and I think I can do that for her.

To bring it back to the dilemma of why I can't just ask her out. Both of us are currently in dating relationships that are pretty solid. Both of us have been dating different people for 2 or 3 years. Both relationships seem to be lacking that certain something. We have both admitted that our current SO's might not be ""the one"". 
Still we both do have passion for our current relationships and get along with our SO's quite well. Speaking for myself I really do like my girlfriend and I want to be apart of her life even if we aren't dating because she is an amazingly nice and great person overall. I think she deserves the world. But me and my girlfriend just don't get along like me and my best friend. 

Both of our dating relationships are on the downward trend recently which might have to do with why I am making this post at this time. Nowhere near critical breaking up point but we are both complaining about our SO's much more frequently as of late. Me and my bestfriend have been spending much more time with eachother than our with SO's in the past few months.

I am looking for some advice here reddit. Should I tell my bestfriend how I truly feel? I really don't think she would be the type if person to drop our friendship if I told her but there is always doubts. Or should I give it more time to see how things go? because this may be fueled by the downward trend of our relationships. I just feel that if I never attempt to try and date my best friend I will never know if she could be ""the one"" because currently I feel like I am more in love with my friend than my girlfriend. 

Thanks for reading and hope to get some helpful responses!",2019-07-07 07:14:12,8,0,relationship_advice

578,ca2cof,railwayhues,One of my best friends HATES the guy I’m in love with,"I feel like I’ve finally reached a crossroad and I don’t know where to go from here. 
I (F22) have fallen in love with a guy (M24) who one of my best friends (F25) despises. 

Before reading here’s some context. A lot of my peers are rougher people. Those who’ve had drug problems or are more prone to violence. I do not condone either. This story crosses a long period of time, and a lot of context is needed so my apologies for the length. 

It all started before I knew both of them. We’ll call the guy Joe and my best friend Sarah. Coincidentally, about 6 years ago, Joe and Sarah were good friends. We all have similar career paths and have many mutual friends. Back then Joe was admittedly rowdy. At 19 he drank a lot, did drugs and has openly and honestly expressed that. 

Around Christmas 5-6 years ago, Sarah threw a holiday party which Joe attended. Both of them are spotty with the details, but from my understanding a member of Joe’s group got out of hand, and was trying to start a fight with another partygoer. While attempting to intermediate between parties, Joe ended up taking part of the blame and was kicked out. After being kicked out Joe and a few of his friends drunkenly decided to sneak back into Sarah’s home and steal a few of her collectables.   

From then on their feud arose. They slowly vocally disfavoured the other and stayed away from each other for the most part... until about 2 years ago. I still don’t know either of them at this point.

They ended up crossing paths at a small party near the end of the night. Sarah had been at this party for a while with her boyfriend and sister, while Joe and his friends had just arrived. The two groups got into an argument which eventually led to shoving. Sarah’s boyfriend began to fight Joe, while Sarah fought a girl in Joe’s party. 
Here’s where the details get spotty. Sarah claims that in this fight Joe had pulled a knife on Sarah’s sister, and that eventually both parties had enough and left. 

Not long after this event I met Sarah for the first time, having no knowledge of these events.

Eventually, about a year into our friendship I start hanging out with a few of Joe’s mutual friends. When Sarah finds out she finally tells me the whole backstory.
At first I was shocked and disgusted with Joe. I knew of him through his work but didn’t know his character, and after hearing these stories I avoided him. 

Overtime Sarah tells me these stories again and again- yet the details begin to change. They become seemingly embellished and based on emotion rather than pure memory. After a while I begin to cross reference what I’ve been told by Sarah,  with what mutual non involved peers have heard. To my surprise I hear a lot of people defending Joe- primarily that he wouldn’t never pull a knife on anyone, let alone a woman.
This is when I start to rethink Sarah’s credibility.
I start to realize that although I love Sarah very much, something felt off about her version of this story. 

Fast forward a few months (around last October) and I find myself in the city celebrating a friend’s birthday. This friends happens to be a mutual friend of Joe’s. We end up in the same bar as Joe where I meet him for the first time. Expecting a terrifying, violent and rude guy, I am greeted by quite the opposite. 
(I’ve been in abusive relationships in the past so I am very weary when I meet others, especially men.)  By the end of the night I almost felt bad because Joe and I got along better than Sarah and I do! We end up talking extensively over the next few weeks online.

Feel free to judge me here because this is where I cross the “girl code” line. A few weeks later I finally decide to hang out with Joe - not a date- just hanging out. After spending another amazing day with Joe,I finally muster up the courage to:
1) Cuss Joe out for everything he’s done to Sarah 
2) Ask for his side of the story. 

He openly admits he was wrong. Apologizes, for his previous actions and firmly stands behind the fact that he would never pull a knife on anyone. He explains his past problematic drug habits and how his teenage years were full of anger from his dad leaving. He even offers to replace all of Sarah’s collectables and apologize, although he says Sarah is stubborn and likely won’t take them which is why he’s never tried.

I was taken aback and surprised at how genuine Joe was. 
And so I shyly attempt to run the idea of an apology and return of belongings by Sarah, who in return explodes. 
At this point I find out for myself Sarah is stubborn. 

She states “people don’t change. I’ve been the same since I was a little girl” (I’ll never forget that line because of how ridiculous it sounded).
Sarah is convinced Joe is just acting. And so I decided to drop the idea and maintain cautious of Joe.

Overtime Joe and I become friends. I feel bad but as previously stated we end up getting along better than Sarah and I do. I maintain cautious but he reveals himself to be a genuinely good guy. When I’m sick he offers to bring food. He slowly boosts my confidence, reminding me what I deserve. We could talk about anything. We could do anything and I’d be happy. 

After knowing him for a little while I express concerns over his drug habits, and in surprising response he decides his New Years resolution will be to get clean. A month later he quits smoking as well. 

It’s been about 8/9 months of knowing Joe and he’s made huge progress as a person since we first met. He’s maintained his resolution. Even his friends (who are my friends as well), have expressed how much Joe and I have helped each other. He’s also become one of my best friends and supporters. I’ve never been so close with someone. There’s nothing he doesn’t know about be and vice versa. He’s opened me up to his family and his past. I’ve basically fallen in love and could really see myself with him long term. 
He pushes me to do better for myself. He reminds me every day of my worth, and consistently states his gratitude. 

Within this time Sarah has obviously become upset, and I feel like a jerk because I get where she’s coming from; however, she makes no attempt to hear my side. She puts me down every time I try to make a point. She believes no one can change. 
She has made it clear it’s basically an ultimatum between herself and Joe. 
The last time I tried I tried talking to Sarah about this she ended up yelling in a restaurant. 

I’d really like to attempt a relationship with Joe but I know it will likely cost my relationship with Sarah. Sarah is convinced Joe is the same person she knew well 6 years ago. 

So I’m basically stuck... does anyone have any wisdom to share ?",2019-07-07 03:19:29,2,2,relationship_advice

today, some friends and i got together for a birthday bbq, he and i were talking a lot, he sat next to me, shared a plate with me, took bites of my food and even threw a kebab back on the grill for me when i said it wasn’t cooked enough for my preference. 

the strangest piece of it all to me is that he hugged me goodbye, when a month or two ago he would not have done that if i was dying on the floor. 

although he did make comments about looking for hot girls....

my question is: is this normal of friends to do? or is he signaling something more?

581,ca2b0d,throway37965428,My (24F) best friend (24M) was given an ultimatum by his GF(19F). Her or Me,"Throwaway account


My best friend, let's call him A, has been dating this girl, call her B, for a few months now. Their relationship started off a bit rocky as he was kinda sleeping with me  while also seeing her but but long story short myself and A moved passed it all and have a good solid friendship with no romantic interest in each other (we were friends before we slept together).

Recently he was confiding in me over whatsapp (he lives in another country while I'm now back at home) about some worries in his relationship as B was going away on a holiday with her friend and apparently B's friend can be a bit influential. I made a comment which A then stupidly screenshots and sends to B, this is when B tells him that she hates me (we've never met), but that doesn't  bother me that much. Fast forward a couple of days and A messages me telling me that B has given him and ultimatum either continue to be friends with me or dump me as a friend and keep B as a gf, at this point I got super angry because I don't  think it's fair that A has to choose whether he gets to be my friend or not. We have been through a lot of crap over the past year and either way we made it through it, I value A so much as a friend and I tell him everything and vice versa. I've been supportive of his relationship (maybe not so much at the beginning) because I know how much being with B means to him and I want him to be happy but the past 3 days he has been ignoring me because he had told B he would cut back contact with me. 

My personal opinion is that no relationship is worth losing a friend over but he seems to be more inclined to take her side and dump me as a friend and I'm beginning to wonder if this is a friendship that I want to keep fighting for? Maybe I'm just being dramatic, maybe I'm the one being unfair and even if he does choose B over our friendship should i support his choice and wait in the wings incase the relationship doesn't last and he needs a friend? I'm really unsure on what to do. This is a guy who I speak to nearly every single day and who I have 2 hours phone conversations with, so to go from talking every day to being ignored because B doesn't like me and wants A to ditch me as a friend, makes me feel a bit betrayed and hurt. I don't  know if it's  important to the story but A won't  be seeing B until christmas time so they will be apart for a while. 

Tbh I really just don't know what to do, sit back and support any decision he makes whether it be stay with B and be rid of our friendship or keep our friendship and end it with B. Or do I just end the friendship there and let him get on with his life with B?

Tl;Dr: GF of best friend gave him an ultimatum,her or me. He seems to be more on the side of her so I don't know if this friendship is worth fighting for or if I'm just being a dick and not very supportive",2019-07-07 03:14:13,6,2,relationship_advice

We video called each other and made sure to keep in touch every single day and know how each other's days have been. I didn't thought of it as a burden as I really cared for her. Then, she told me that she wanted to experience the outside world. The reason being that she wanted to make sure that one day if we do get into marriage, she won't regret it and she will give her all to it. She asked me whether I would wait for her as she believes that if we're meant to be, we would come back to be with each other again no matter what.

in KSA there is a stupid thing called prayer break.(where they close everything and i mean everything for 30 min prayer break and they do it 5 times a day, no matter what you want or have to do you gotta wait), i called my wife and asked her where she is ,she replied at ZARA and she is sad because she wanted Ice cream and couldn't find a store that sells it,

so me being a loving husband thought to surprise her with one and ran to the nearest market and got a simple cone,

and then the prayer came and places closed and i meet her by the car,i gave her the ice cream and she dint even thank me, like oh nice of you BTW i didn't buy cloth such a bummer, i am like (okeh never mind).

halfway home she stopped me in the middle of a sentence to tells me (never buy this kind of ice cream again),

i responded (okeh? i thought it would be nice gesture )

,she replied (well it hurts my teeth), i was quite and it  did show on my face that i didn't like the response, so i turned on some music and Rihanna(put a ring on it) came up ,

so she said in a mocking voice (you are a single lady) and then snorted, i ignored it and said to her ( you know i am really tired an..)

 and then she cut me off again saying (no you are just lazy).

i was fed up and just stayed quite all the way home while she after 5 mins noticed and said with a worry tone (dear are you OK?)

i ignored her all night because i don't want to say a word and she will make it somehow that i am too sensitive and  just went to bed. 

now i am at work and i feel like my heart is sinking because i miss her voice and i am not sure if its my fault or hers.

&amp;#x200B;

i know people will say i am the man and stuff.

but god fucking damn it i have feelings as well.

&amp;#x200B;

what should i do ?

586,ca40hf,jattangki,"Need advise, GF active on Tinder","Hi guys, Im here to ask some advise on this little issue im having. I met my GF on tinder a little over one year ago. My time with her has been the happiest ive felt in my life. I really thought she was the one for me. A few weeks ago, I was helping her setup her new phone and accidentally read her dm in instagram with some guy i do not know. To clear my mind i ask her who he is. She told me hes just a friend. And later she admitted that she know the guy from Tinder recently. I felt crushed that she is still active on Tinder. Weve talk abt it about a week. She told me that she was on Tinder because of boredom and because we were far apart. Take note that I work in different city from each other recently so it might cause some ripples in the relationship. After that i decided to let it slide and willing to forgive for that. However now after about a month im still thinking about this. Should i break up with her? I felt strongly for her but this kept coming to my mind that i doubt that it will do our relationship any good. Please give me some advice or at least something to think about. Thanks.",2019-07-07 06:49:10,14,1,relationship_advice
587,ca0zwd,JCinBC,My girlfriend (F35) is upset that I M(39) always have my kids (age 9 and 6) above her in my priorities.,"I got divorced from my wife of 15 years about a year ago. We were great friends and parents but had basically a dead romantic relationship and love life. Things started falling apart about five years ago until I finally decided that I wanted more in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

We got separated and basically due to logistics, time and things like that, the kids live with me during the week and spend 3 out of 4 weekends with their mother. This arrangement is fine by me, I love my kids above anything are really the most important thing in my life.

 About six months ago I started dating someone, things have been pretty great and we are still going but things have started getting complicated. Since the divorce is still fresh, I don't think my kids are ready to see me dating so I only spend time with her on the weekends when I dont have the kids and basically schedule my time with her around my time with the kids. She has started complaining about this, she says that she feels that the kids are at the top of my list and she always comes after them. I think she's right but I don't know if this is something I should change or if its something she has to accept if she want to be with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Some extra facts: 

&amp;#x200B;

she does not have kids has never wanted kids and does not really like kids but has stated that is willing to make an effort with my kids

&amp;#x200B;

she has meet my kids, I did not introduce her as my gf but as one of my friends, she got along fine with my daughter (6 year old) but I did not like her interactions with my son (9 years old)",2019-07-07 00:51:15,9,3,relationship_advice
588,ca3zno,throwaway84847374747,Reconnecting with an ex-lover,"I just got out of a serious long term relationship.   About 15 years.

Back when I first started dating my ex, I was ending a relationship with a friend with benefits.   We hung out a lot, slept together a ton, but when it started to seem like it was get lying too serious, I met my now-ex, and went in her direction to try a new relationship, rather than try to figure out a real relationship with the FWB.   So, I ended that FWB relationship, and began my 15 year relationship with my now-ex.

A couple months ago, my ex ended things for good.  It was a rough road, but I’m starting to feel human again.

Shortly after my ex ended things, I contacted my old FWB on Facebook, and we reconnected.  Seriously and immediately reconnected, and she’s been good medicine at getting me through the breakup.

I had always stalked her a little of Facebook to see what she was up to, and I always wondered where the relationship could have gone, because I was still really attracted to her, but she ended up getting married and having kids.  I didn’t openly contact her, or try to meet and catch up, because A) I was in my relationship and do not stray, and B) I wouldn’t want to confuse her in her relationship, so i just kept my distance and I thought my future was written, and would never know what could have been.

Now, since my breakup we’ve reconnected, but here’s the issue.   She is still married with several teenage children.   We’ve been texting constantly, and she hasn’t said it in so many words, but she seems to be in a marriage she doesn’t want to be in any more, that she is not committed to, and is only staying with her husband for the sake of the kids.

Things are getting serious quickly between us by text, and she’s asked several times to meet up.

I need advice.   I am usually a pretty moral person, but  even how intimate we are by text feels like I’ve crossed a line.   And meeting up?   I think that would end up out of control.  And where would I be... WHO would I be if we ended up in a physical relationship again?  While she’s married!

And we both live on the west coast about 6 hours apart.   Too far to maintain a relationship, but close enough to meet clandestine when we could get away.

Does anyone have any advice to offer?",2019-07-07 06:46:00,2,0,relationship_advice

592,ca3waq,Ryan3737m,Should I ask out my best friend’s twin sister who I have been crushing on hard?,"In the past I have posted on this issue, but there have been some new developments. Basically to summarize everything, my best friend (17M) who we will call Dave has a twin sister (17F) who we will call Anna. They are very close and I have never hung out with Anna without Dave being present. I have been crushing on Anna for maybe a year, but I am hesitant to ask her out. We all go to different schools and I see her maybe once a month when hanging out with my best friend (their parents are divorced and I only visit when they are at their dad’s because his house is closer, and she is often traveling for Volleyball), so I see her a very limited amount.  We will make jokes in each other’s IG post comments publicly together, but I don’t text or snap her outside of that. I want to ask her out, but I do not want to jeopardize my relationship with my best friend. I wanted to text Dave (without Anna in the chat) and ask if he and Anna would want to see the new Men In Black movie at the mall with me. This sounds great in my opinion, but there are two problems. The first is that I have never asked her to hangout with Dave and I, only Dave has invited both of us to hangout, but Anna has never asked me to hangout with Dave and her, and I have never asked her to hangout with Dave and I. Dave is the middle man for Anna and I’s friendship. She is cool so I don’t think she’d say no, but the second problem is her or I feeling like a third wheel. Dave is the connection between Anna and I. I barely have a friendship with her because of my limited (and only in a group with her brother) interactions with her. I don’t want her to feel like she is third wheeling Dave and I’s friendship, and I don’t want to feel like I’m third wheeling Anna’s and Dave’s sibling friendship. I kind of want a equilateral friendship triangle I guess, where we are all equally friends, but Anna and I are dating. 

Also quick side note; there was a rumor roughly 6 years ago when we were 11ish that Anna and I were dating, and she thought I started it and confronted me about it to which I declined. She was bothered by the rumor, and at the time I had no interest in her and since it wasn’t true I didn’t care at the time. I figured I would add this part to the story because she seemed bothered by the rumor we were dating and questioned if it was me who started it. We haven’t talked about the rumor since, which would be water under the bridge since we were young and it was so long ago. But her feelings for me may not have changed and she may not want to date me, which is a decision I would respect, but I don’t want the false rumor she at one point thought I started, to hold me back or for her to view me as a liar. I’m not even sure if she remembers it, but it was a big deal back then. 

Should I ask her out at all? Is the movie a good start to building a stronger relationship with her? How do I break the ice with her? Should I tell Dave my feelings beforehand or right before I ask her out a few dates down the road? Any other recommendations or criticisms? What should my game plan be? I have like a million questions and would all the input and responses I can get. I appreciate you all for reading this. Have a great day.",2019-07-07 06:32:26,4,1,relationship_advice

594,ca21yc,imconfused12344,My boyfriend stepped on my stomach on purpose,"So my boyfriend was in the living room looking for something for his computer. He couldn’t find it so he asked me and I said I don’t know, and he was kind of joking and said “everyone’s gonna get stressed out until I find it”. He’s never said anything like that before and he wasn’t mad or irritated so idk. Plus it’s just me and him here 

I was in our bedroom on the bed. I kept telling him I don’t know, but then I told him I knew where an alternative to it was. And he kept talking over me from the other room. He had headphones on. I kept saying where it was and what it was but he just wouldn’t listen, it was going in one ear and out the other. Even when he was in our room I had to yell for him to pay attention to what i was saying. 

Earlier we ate a lot of food so my stomach is super full in a bad way. I regret eating so much smh. It’s cramping pretty badly and I told him a couple of times. He has a habit of jumping on me from behind or shaking my body/parts of it crazily. So when I heard him walking up to me the first time, I told him do not jump on me because my stomach hurts. He didn’t 

Then flash forward to now, when he needed something for his computer and after saying the comment about stressing everyone out, he was standing on our bed above me and put his foot in my stomach and jumped it up and down. It wouldn’t have hurt if my stomach wasn’t hurting but it was, badly, and he knew that. So either he didn’t care if his actions hurt me or he just didn’t listen to me when I said my stomach hurts. 

Anyways, he kept doing it and I kept telling him to stop. But he does this often and it’s usually lighthearted so he didn’t take me seriously. But then I started crying because I was so overwhelmed and him continuously shaking my stomach was hurting me. 

So he immediately stopped when he saw I was crying and tried to comfort me and asked me why I was crying. He said he was just joking. I told him my stomach hurts and you stepped on it. Then he said “ok baby I’m just going to leave you alone” .. he didn’t say sorry or anything. So there was obviously a misunderstanding. 

I think that he thinks my stomach hurt because of what he did and that I was overreacting because it never does when he jumps around. It’s annoying and frustrating sometimes but that’s it. If this is the case, that means he didn’t listen to me when I said my stomach hurts. I don’t think he wanted to hurt me, but he did. And now he’s ignoring me because either he thinks I overreacted to make him feel bad or because he feels bad? Idk, but I think it’s the first one. 

So idk what to do because my stomach is seriously hurting and it’s not necessarily because he stepped on it but obviously that hurt a lot when it was happening. But he doesn’t understand that my stomach hurts so he must think I’m overreacting. Idk, I’m just really confused and I need some opinions on this situation",2019-07-07 02:46:18,12,2,relationship_advice
595,ca3w4q,Fermats_Last_Account,I [26M] feel like I'm always the problem in the relationships but I just simply don't see what I did wrong?,"I've been cheated over 6 times. These are the last 3. TLDR at the end.

My longest relationship was about 10 months and I was 18 at the time. We dated for 10 months without a single fight.. Well, the only reason we got into our first fight was because she cheated on me with someone from her Church. She gave me no reason why she did it, but I broke up with her immediately since I don't tolerate cheaters at all.

Then I started dating someone from one of my classes after graduating high school. It was my first real sexual relationship and we were friends with benefits first before we decided to date. She told me her ex started messaging her and I told her he's going to want to be with her if she continues to talk to him, but I'm not the type to control someone so I just warned her that she should watch out for him. She shrugged it off as him just being ""friendly."" This ex cheated on her back in high school by the way. Well, a month later she stopped seeing me, rarely texted me, and overall kept spending more and more time with him and then she just flat out started dating him. She told me she didn't want to be with me anymore because of my high sex drive but I called her a cheater and broke up with her. But she did initiated it many times to me even coming over every morning by her own choice before work for sex.

5 years later after 1 failed relationship (didn't cheat), I met someone at a grocery store where I used to work at. She seemed very much into me and we started talking on the phone, flirting, etc. After she expressed interest in dating me, I asked her out with roses and a gift. Well it turns out, she was flirting with several guys all at once that she went to sleep with one of them after a night of drinking. She called him that night to pick her up even though she only knew this guy for 1 month. Again, I broke up since she cheated on me.

**TLDR**: I don't see what I did wrong. I always avoid arguments or fights, I'm very understandable, I always text back and even good morning and goodnight messages, I always tried to go on nice dates once in a while (I always paid for everything), I never express anger or scream at them, and I gave romantic gifts if the occasion arose. I was always up front and honest and they all knew how much I hate liars and cheaters. I have a best friend who says that I ""always go for the wrong girls"". How?? I don't know if someone is a cheater. Do I just have bad luck??",2019-07-07 06:31:44,10,1,relationship_advice

597,ca21kn,CasualPeachSex,How does my GF [F20] or I [M20] tell her sister [F22] that their music/performance needs to get better.,"My GF's sister's music duo just released their first song for which we did the artwork and release it on YouTube. I will not post it to keep anonymity. Basically, it's good, but not good enough for the world out there. To put it in perspective, the arrangements could be better, the sound richer and the recording, despite being recorded in a professional environment, sounds dull. This is a common pattern for a lot of their music (which has not been released yet).  
Also, their live performance lacks presence. They're often very stressed or anxious and it shows, they'll play songs that are old and don't represent their current style/quality of work. For example, they'll have a lot of songs that are emotional, personal with good lyrics and then they'll throw in a comedic song about drugs, which will completely break the vibe.  


Despite all this bashing, they're actually quite good. They're really good at using melodies, harmonies and lyrics that will entrance you. There are often moments in their shows that we can tell the audience really connects with the music/them. They're also both very charismatic people outside of performing, but, my GF's sister can get hurt easily and her partner \[F23\] can be quite explosive (for lack of better word).  
Now, we both feel they would benefit a lot from, perhaps, better production and/or mentoring (other people we've talked to also agreed). They currently have a vocal coach. Also, they're working with a producer that they're very close to, but we feel it might not be the right one for them.  
Also, my GF's dad has this tendency to be very controlling, invasive and tends to not be very supportive. He'll go straight to critiquing (and not in a very useful way) when ""Sister"" will show him music instead of trying to appreciate or encourage her, which puts a lot of doubts and anxiety on her shoulders. Knowing this, my GF is scared that her sis would take her critique as a sign of her lack of talent or capability, which is really not what were trying to bring forward.  


Since they know a lot more about music then us, we don't exactly know how to bring useful constructive advice and saying nothing is, in a sense, hurting them more.  
How should we approach this?",2019-07-07 02:45:12,13,2,relationship_advice

600,ca0rp7,MrxBrightsidex,First relationship/worst relationship lol i need somve advice lol. Im sad and chick cheated on me. I stayed with her for 9months after word. Did i hurt my self staying after she cheated?,"Hello everyone first post on Reddit!! 

So I have a story to share with you guys and maybe you guys could help me with some personal demons I have. 


A couple years ago now 2 or 3 maybe I was in a relationship with this amazing person we will call her Sam. Sam and I met when I moved in with my cousin David for a job I had at the time. The job was me working 11-13 hour days cutting 180 foot trees down next to house and stuff.  It was a great job made a lot of money and learned a lot. 

Well about a month after I have been living there David's girlfriend and baby momma's sister moved back from Texas to be with her sister and her mother in New Mexico. ( yes it's part of the USA look at a map) she had prolly been back in New Mexico for a month when we started hanging out. At first it was just friends chatting away when I got off work. We soon found our selves sneaking in to each other's room and staying up all night cuddling talking the night away. It was really nice if I'm going to be honest. I told her everything about me stuff I didn't tell anyone. I told her about my real mom leaving when I was 3 for meth and how I was abused by an X-marine from 4-8 and everything in between. She excepted me she didn't pitty me or even say I was fucked up in the head and needed to see a doctor. 

I fell for her. I did I would sleep 2 hours a night just so we could spend time together and talk and just spend time with one another. Couple months went by like this. We decided to be a couple and get together. The first year was a dream it was wonderful. I loved it we went to the fair, movies, concerts, and everything in between. We grew very close even as my fathers second wife and him were getting a divorce. That was a ruff time in my life everything felt as if it was falling apart. I do have PTSD and I get night terrors from getting abuse. I would wake up in the middle of the night sweaty crying shaking from a bad dreams. Sam wouldn't say anything or get scared she would just hold me and tell me everything would be okay. The night terrors got worse as the divorce got finalized and my anger issues came back. I was a broken inside and felt alone but I never pushed Sam away. She was my boat in the sea of shit I was in. 

As it got closer to our second anniversary me and Sam were fighting a lot more I lost my job because my boss had a drug issues and ran the company under. So I was on the hunt for a new job. The stress in the house was high me and Sam were always at each other over every little thing that really didn't matter but we could see that at the time.  My cousin David his girlfriend and new baby boy invited Sam and I to go to Colorado with them. Sam and I were fighting pretty heavy at the time so I decided to stay in New Mexico and spend time with my father. I didn't want to ruin the trip with my issues and me and Sam fighting so I opptied out. (First mistake). 

So when they left instead if me not going they took my other cousin we will call him Brice. Brice and I have always had problems. There was a past between us that we couldn't mend no matter how hard we tried. I just stayed away from the guy because he just wasn't someone I wanted to be around. Brice has 2 little girls and a 3rd child on the way with a different women, so me and Sam did fight over the phone while she was gone and it was shitty. Sam and I could never find common ground to just restart and it was draining both of us. I decided to stop txting Sam. I didn't want to ruin her trip I wanted her to come back refreshed and happy to see me... I was prolly 4 or 5 days since I talked to Sam and they were on there way back. Sam only one word replied to me the whole time. She never did that to me even if we were fighting. She always txt me normally i couldn't tell you why but she just did. 

I went home and greeted Sam at the door when she got home. I went tin for a kiss and got denied. I was mad I figured she was mad because I didn't talk to her for 5 days. Sam's and I sex life was never boring. We were a very sexually active couple. I'm talking 8-9 times a week. Well anytime I would try to get her in the mood I got shit down. I still thought maybe she was mad at me still. It was just about a week and she barley touched me or even looked in my direction... When I say I love her I mean I really did I would have died for her if it ment maken her happy. 
I did what any anxiety ridden boyfriend would do and I went through her phone looking for answers on why she was acting this way.. I found nothing to txt messages, Snapchats, or even a guys number in her phone. I was relived but still very confused. 

Well Brice had been living in the spare house in the property where we all lived. Him and his new baby momma were fighting or something idk all the details, but he was there all the time. Brice didn't work he's not the job type. Well David and me were up late drinking beer one night and he tells me something he really didn't want to tell me. He is the one person who knows me. He knows my anger issues how violent I am. He know.. Well David told me why Sam is acting weird with me since Colorado. He told me that Brice and Sam got drunk the first night up there and they slept with each other. He continues and tells me it happens the whole 2 weeks they were up there.. I was broken. I started to cry right there in front of him everything made sense now. It made sense with her actions since she got back. I slept in my Jeep that night. I woke up at 9am in a hungover stupper. Everything David told me running thew my head as soon as I opened my eyes.. I felt alone. 

I confronted Sam I told her I knew what happened in Colorado.. She said "" Oh yeah smart guy! What happened? ""  When I relayed everything my cousin told me the night before. Her eyes got wide and her jaw dropped a bit. I knew in that moment with the look in her eyes that David wasn't lying... That hurt worse then being told what happened.. She was stammering for words trying to think of something to say I just stopped her and went to the room and layed on the bed. She came in a short while after touching my side. She apologized said yes it happened. I didn't have any words to say I was just hurt and broken knowing Brice is not even 150 steps away from the house. A little later me and her started talking turned in to fighting. We caught all day and most that night around 4am I decided to go stay at my dad's house for the night I didn't want to be there. (Second mistake) 

I went to my father and he stayed up with me drinking and talking about what I should do. He him self was going through his own relationship problems. Trying to help me but he was lost himself. He told me if I love her to go back over there and stand my ground and work it out like an adult. I took that to heart. The next day I awoke around 12-1 in the afternoon. Showered got dressed and drove back down there. I pulled up to the house and parked my Jeep shutting it off. I didn't get out tho I was thinking about what to say or how to approach the conversation. I didn't want it to turn to us yelling again.  About 15 minutes goes by and I finally step out of my Jeep XJ. My cousin David met me at the rear of my Jeep and stopped me. All he said was it happened again last night. After I had just spent all day screaming and yelling talking to her about why it happened the day before. He gave me a cigarette and walked away. I felt like someone stabbed me strait in the heart. I lit the cigarette and smoked it in 3 minutes. I stepped on the but of the cigarette and headed in side. Sam was still asleep in bed. Still looking as beautiful as ever. Even through all my pain she still looked stunning to me. She was perfect in my eyes before this and now I looked at her with a heavy heart and no trust. I still loved her with all my being.. 

Sam woke up with me staring at her. She rubbed her beautiful brown eyes with sleepiness still in her eyes sat up and motioned for me to sit next to her. I declined and stayed standing. I decided to give her the choice and tell me she slept with Brice again last night after I left. So I asked her if she fucked Brice last night. Before she got a word out I said I already new the answer I just want to hear it from her. She closed her mouth and just nodded with tears forming in her eyes. She wimmperd out a I'm sorry. 
I ignored her apology and went to my Jeep to smoke a cigarette. 

This is where I chose the high road. I wanted to fight Brice I wanted to beat his ass and send him to the hospital regardless of the jail time I would have got. I didn't want my dad to have to see me in jail and I definitely did want my 3 year old nephew who was with me at the time to be afraid of me. 

I stayed with Sam for another 9 months after all of this happened I took my fathers advice and I tried to fix it. I grasped at anything  to try to fix us. It was a failure. We just could get over it. We kept fight and throwing our past in each other's faces. We just talked down to each other and made each other feel shitty. About the 9th month came around and I just couldn't do it any more I packed all my stuff in my Jeep XJ. I had just got a job at Walmart and I used it as my out if the relationship. I lived in my Jeep for 3 weeks after that. Me and Sam talked but it just never was the same. Eventually we just stopped texting eachother...  

It's been 3 years since then I've only been in one relationship since then and everything that happened with Sam still affects me. I didn't trust the person I was with and was way to over bearing. I ruined it. I'm still single now I just don't know what to do. 

I recently found out Sam is going to get married soon. Idk why but it hurt when I found out. Idk why I thought that would be us. I thought she was the one for me. I hope the world brings her happiness and success in everything she does.  

My question is did I just damage my self more stay after all that happened? I can say I still love her when I think about her I miss her. It's been three years now and I can't seem to get my self back out there.  Should I even care about it anymore.. Idk guys I'm telling you guys this because I've turned to everyone one I can and they don't help... Idk what to do I'm still really depressed and shit. I want the pain to stop. I don't want to think about her anymore.  Idk if you guys have any advice for me I would appreciate it. I'm lost have been for the last three years.

602,ca3uez,whatevsitsathrowaway,"Dealing with the falling out with my [20F] best guy friend [23M], and his betrayal after I got raped.","About 3 weeks ago, I went to a house party with my best guy friend that became the biggest clusterfuck of my entire life. 

That night, not only was I raped by one of his (now ex) best friends after everyone else had left, my ex-best guy friend and I had drunken sex earlier in the night. The whole night was a mess and I regret it immensely, especially because he has a (long-distance) girlfriend. 

We had a lot of amazing times, supported each other through ups and downs, and never argued about anything. There were no red flags I could think of during the friendship with him (which is why the betrayal came as a shock), except that him and I always had a sense of strong chemistry with each other - however, neither of us wanted to admit to it, and I have no idea how much of that is attributed to simply having a strong friendship and being able to be open. Either way, in hindsight, I’m now almost certain that him and I had feelings for each other, and both of us were in denial. 

In the immediate aftermath, my best guy friend was wholly supporting me with the rape, and told me not to worry about our friendship in the time being, but that we definitely had to create a bit of space between us for a while and create strict boundaries when we hang out again. He made sure I was okay, bought me Plan B, and took care of me. He said that he would do everything he can to support me and make sure that he was available for me to talk to. He also immediately cut all contact with his best friend who raped me without question. At this point, I had no indication that anything would happen between us. 

A few days after all this happened, his girlfriend moved back here permanently. When she got back, his demeanour and language very suddenly changed and he became very cold towards me. I never saw him again once she got back, and his messages were very withdrawn and limited, though he continued to give support. Out of the blue in the middle of our conversation, I noticed that he had blocked me on text messages and Snapchat. 

A day after that, he decided to end our friendship completely due to him having cheated on his girlfriend, cut me off and block me on every social media platform - which included not support me regarding the rape situation. In his words, he said - “I apologize for saying I would be there and not making good on that. I hope you eventually find peace. Know this is something I have to do.”

I feel a lot more pain, surprisingly, than the rape itself because it’s a complete loss of trust, betrayal, and an overwhelming amount of hurt. We were both extremely vulnerable and open during our friendship and he knew how deep my trust issues run, and for that matter we had many conversations about how trust is so important and valuing our closest friends (which we were). I felt the most comfortable and 100% myself around him, and given how honest we were with each other, there was no indication of this coming. He then essentially turned around and did the exact same thing that he said he despised in people. 

I understand why he would have cut off our friendship (for his relationship) had the rape not occurred, but the fact he essentially decided to leave at my darkest time and never talk to me again is beyond anything I thought a friend could do to hurt me. 

I’m left questioning how genuine anything he said during the friendship was, and how much he actually trusted me. I’m wondering where I went wrong. I also question how much of the ending of the friendship is attributed to his girlfriend or whether she directly played a part in the falling out (I’m not sure how much he told her). 

TL;DR: I really need advice on how to make better choices in terms of trusting people again, and how to keep myself safe and guarded moving forward in friendships. Is it possible to forgive him? Is there any chance of closure or making amends? How do I start healing and trying to remove any feelings I may have for him?",2019-07-07 06:24:55,20,1,relationship_advice

I signed up for culinary (moreso baking) class this summer and through the past week or so, a guy has caught my eye. He seems really cool (albeit a bit more reserved) and I really want to be friends with him but I have no idea how to ask without being incredibly awkward. he looks kinda intimidating and the few conversations i've tried to strike up didn't last very long, so my chances don't seem the best... this upcoming week is my last week of class so i want to muster up the courage to ask, but first off, i don't know how to ask him to be my friend, second off, i'm not sure what time would be best to bring it up, and third off, i don't even know if he'll say yeah. i'm not the most outgoing person and the class has about 25 or so people (who are always either in the kitchen or classroom) so i don't know when or where i'd even ask without possibly bothering someone else with my pathetic attempts. any and all advice on what to do would be greatly appreciated!

604,ca3tnt,Soo_O,Not sure if me [F:25] or my boyfriend [M:30] should be in a relationship in general right now. We are going though a lot... but don’t know if/how i should end it.,"So My boyfriend and I have been together about 3 months now. We are both going though some things outside of our relationship. These things make me think maybe neither on of us should be in a relationship at the moment. One of the things makes me feel like an asshole for thinking about ending it...

Thing #1: We are both fresh out of supper serious relationships. 

We started dating about a month after my husband and I split up, and about 3 months after him and his girlfriend broke up. 
Me and my ex  have 2 kids (4 and 1), we were together for 6 years. 
He and his ex have a baby together, about 8 months old when we started dating, they were together for about 2 years. 
We were both still living with our ex’s, there was a lot of drama around that, I don't think it's too important but I can add more details about it if anyone wants me too. 

Thing #2: I'm crazy and still working on my mental health. 

About 2 years ago I went through a major depression, I never felt so hopeless... I would still describe me depression as terminal. I was planning on killing myself but thought, for my kid's sake, I should at least try to get help. I started getting help but had a really bad identity crisis. To try and sum things up I felt like I wouldn't be me without my depression, I questioned my sexuality in many ways, I didn't know what I liked or didn't like, I knew literally nothing about me. It was honestly just about as scary as feeling as hopeless as I did. The identity crisis was a major factor that ended my marriage. I have a better idea of who I am now, but I'm still working on it. 

Thing #3: his baby was taken...

A little over a month ago my boyfriend's ex left the house with their baby and never came back. By the time he found out something was wrong, she already left the state. The police couldn't do anything about it because they have split custody. The next day he started working on trying to get full custody but after a few weeks he found out she got a restraining order against him, giving her temporary custody... He was and is devastated... Most of the time he hides it well but I've seen him break down a few times...  The first couple of weeks he basically lived with me because he couldn't stand to be in his house and see his baby's stuff with his baby gone.. 

This is where I feel like an asshole, why I don't know what to do... I was hesitant from the start to jump into a new relationship, I really wanted to work on myself and focus on myself, but I started to really like and care for this guys and thought maybe I can do both. I thought I can still work on me and be with him, he seems super supportive when it comes to figuring myself out and has helped me through a lot before we even became official. But with everything going on with his baby, he's been really distant...
We are still getting to know each other so it's hard to tell what's normal behavior for him and what's just him going through something, I can't even begin to imagine. 
He told me he doesn't know what he would do right now if I wasn't here, and I've been so helpful to him while he’s going through all this. and I don't know how to handle that... I'm bearly holding on to my sanity, I can't be responsible for someone else too.. 

With some of the ways he's acting, I'm not sure I can live with. Sometimes things are really good, I love him and feel like we are perfect for each other, and I feel like he feels the same in return. Other times I feel likes he's possibly being manipulative, or I feel likes he's doesn't really care. But again what if he's just not himself at the moment? I don't know... How can you get to know someone, how can you love someone, if they are not themselves? That goes for both of us... But I honestly do care about him. I want him to be happy. What if I leave and it destroys him? But what if I stay with him and these things I can't live with aren't temporary? I don't know what to do...",2019-07-07 06:21:49,1,1,relationship_advice

606,c9zrds,HellaAsta,I barely have a social life and I don't know how to change it," Well, to start with, I'm sorry because English is not my first language and this is probably my first post.  
 For context I am a university student and I am now on vacation which gives me lots of free time to think about what is bothering me. I lost the friendships I had in school and I can't establish great relationships with anyone. This started at the same time I started dating, my friends started to step away because now we have different interests and different ways of thinking. I only have a small group of college friends but they live far away and I also do not feel 100% comfortable with them.   
 With this, there are some times when I feel alone. And I think it's affecting me more than I thought. Every time I got out and got drunk with my college friends, I finish the night crying with them and let them know that I feel like I have no one and I end up spoiling all the fun we had.  
 Now I find it difficult to talk to people, it seems that I don't know the words and I imbibe or say nonsense things or I don't know what to answer. Basically, I don't know how to keep a conversation. I get ashamed to walk on the street alone. Worse, I do not even have anyone to talk to. As I said I'm on vacation, and because of the circumstances I spend my days at home with my dog, capable of not having human contact for several days in a row. I want to change this, I want to enjoy my life but I do not know where to start. Any suggestion?",2019-07-06 22:47:15,4,4,relationship_advice

608,ca1x6i,FederalCollection69,I think my boyfriend has fallen out of love with me,"Sorry on mobile:

I have no self esteem. My boyfriend and I have been dating for one year. He doesn’t text me as much. At the beginning of our relationship he had read receipts activated. I complained one time that I was sick of him leaving me on read and he turned them off. I know he gets my messages because he has an Apple Watch. We live about 2 hours away. He visits me almost every weekend. 

When we first started dating he told me that he had broken up with his ex girlfriend two years prior. I don’t think that’s completely true (according OTT he people around him), I’m not sure if he lied about it or not. 

Fast forward to last Wednesday, I was on Discard with him and his buddies. One of his friends mentioned something about my boyfriend ex and how she came over to his house with my now boyfriend like a year ago. 

I felt super insecure and I called him out on it. He got upset and threatened to end our relationship. The next morning he told me that he felt hurt that I didn’t believe him and how I keep on being up the past and how he wants me to be secure in our relationship. He also said that he wasn’t going to break up with me that night he was just very upset. 

After this happened I feel like everything is weird between us. He came up this weekend with my dog that he’s been taking care of for me since May. When he got here he told me that he forgot to feed his cats and needed to leave on Saturday. 

The entire time we were together I felt like he wanted to leave.

609,ca1vr5,justhereforthedoggo,My (F26) boyfriend (M27) won't hold hands with me if we are with a group of his single co-worker friends because he doesn't want to make them feel uncomfortable.,"Hoping you can help us resolve this issue by providing outside insight. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for over 3 years. Late last year he invited me out to go to a movie with him and three of his single friends (2 male and 1 female, all over 30 years old).
My boyfriend and I sat together at the end of the row with the others sitting next to my boyfriend. During the movie we held hands. After the movie as we exited the theater he drops my hand. I ask him if this meant he didn't want to hold hands anymore. He responded by saying he doesn't want to disturb the group dynamic or make his friends feel uncomfortable by holding my hand.
Background on the friends: the female friend is recently divorced and one of the male friends has trouble talking to women, the other friend was my friend first as I worked with him at a previous employer and actually introduced him to my boyfriend 

They all know he is in a long term relationship with me, that we live together, etc. And all I was asking for was for him to hold my hand.

I feel like by actively choosing not to hold my hand he is putting his friends before me. They were fine with me going to the movie with them and like I mentioned earlier it's not like they weren't aware we are ivn a relationship. I don't think holding hands is throwing our relationship in the face of his single friends, all of who are over thirty years old. 
He feels like if we were holding hands it would have changed the dynamic of the group and made them uncomfortable.

What do you think?

Edit: he asked me to change it to just friends instead of co-worker friends.",2019-07-07 02:27:24,6,2,relationship_advice

611,ca3r7r,throwaway487921,"(18M, 18F) She says I’m acting different, things are awkward now","My main question is at the bottom. 

This past week things have gone bad friend-wise between my crush and I. We went from hanging out alone for the first time (and having fun) and watching a movie and getting dinner with our friends while sitting next to each other, to barely talking on Snapchat or in person (she also stopped sharing her location with me) and her telling me that I’ve been acting differently and things have become awkward. This all took place over the past 5 days.

I have no idea what went wrong. When we hung out alone (never called it a date), we talked for a bit over coffee and then I helped her with getting groceries, still just the two of us. At the movies my friend (who knows I like her) switched seats so I could sit next to her, but she was curled away from me so I couldn’t make any moves, but we did talk at dinner with our friends. 

Wednesday morning I accidentally sent her two messages (nothing bad) which I deleted before explaining what happened but I guess I was acting weird (and I apologized for it in the evening), but then she stopped sharing her location (a sign that she doesn’t trust me, even though she did for a while). 

Thursday we went to barbecue with friends and though we talked a bit there when we were walking next to each other (friends with us) I didn’t talk since we were watching fireworks. Friday I ask her how her day’s going and she responded really coldly. I asked if everything is alright between us, and she said that things have been awkward and I’ve been acting differently. 

I apologized and said that I never intend to make things awkward even though I’m shy. , but I also don’t know what I’ve been doing differently (since I’ve treated her mostly the same). She said that she likes being friends with me so at least something got repaired. 

But I’m still confused about why she’s reacting this way. Is she upset that after a “date” (hanging out alone) that I didn’t make any more moves? Or is she attempting to push me away because she knows I like her (which doesn’t explain a lot of other behaviors indicating the opposite). I wanted to ask her out or tell her how I feel but I’m not sure if that’s a good idea (other redditors are telling me I should).",2019-07-07 06:12:17,9,1,relationship_advice

Cutting to the chase, he went to a therapist for the first time today and just told me he feels a lot of pressure to get engaged but he doesn't feel ready. He doesn't know why not. 

For me, I'm terrified I'm wasting my time. All I can think is that there's a reason he doesn't want to, and when he figures out what it is, we're going to break up. But we do have a good relationship, and I love him, and he says he loves me. So if I walk away because he's not ready then I've thrown away the best relationship, and best friend, I've ever had.

Have been for about a year and some change. After being in for awhile I finally got a duty station for the next 4 years and so my buddy owns a house where I got stationed and I met his tenants friend (we’ll call her Jenna) and her and I started a FWB deal, this has been going on for about 2 months now and we specifically laid out rules such as, we can see anyone else, this isn’t a relationship, and we’re just really good friends. And to be honest we have become literally so close even without the sex. The kicker part to her is, and this is gonna sound so cliché but she’s a stripper. She said she wanted no feelings but she displays feelings as though she’s into me and I recently went home for a 96 and she even texted me she misses me, as in not my dick but MISSES me misses me. Which is very confusing because I broke the rules and caught feelings VERY HARD for her but I’m trying to get rid of them. And I’m still partially in love with her which really sucks because I see her text other guys but she never actually has sex with them she turns them down left and right just to be with me, which again is VERY confusing. That’s just the back story to one side of this decision. On the other side I am also seeing this girl ALSO in the military but not same branch as me but she lives right outside my base vs the stripper who lives an hour away (I may have been late to work once or twice because of this) this other girl we’re gonna call her Megan. Megan is great she’s everything I could ever want in a girl she’s insanely hot, has a stable job and likes all the same things I do and we were so into each other the first time we hung out we didn’t even have sex. Now Megan laid out the same rules the Jenna did. We can see other people,  were just friends for now. And we’re seeing where things go. Megan has her own house and kind of her life put together a little bit more than Jenna does if we’re being completely honest but I’m the type of person to help out with that stuff so it doesn’t really matter to me. On to other topics, sex with Jenna  is phenomenal. Like she knows exactly what I like and I apparently satisfy her very well so it works out. On the other hand sex with Megan is ALSO Phenomenal she may not be as experienced as Jenna but I feel like I just have to work with her more to open her up more in that aspect. All in all I have no idea what I’m doing here I’m in love with both of them and I don’t wanna cut either of them off. Jenna has told me she does not want a relationship period. But she’s not fucking anyone else and treats me like a boyfriend and she also just got out of a very controlling relationship of two years so I understand where she’s coming from. Megan also doesn’t want a relationship but has kinda hinted at seeing wherever this goes she’s ready for it Megan also treats me like a boyfriend and loves to constantly hangout with me even if sex isn’t involved. Jenna though it’s sex all the time which I have no issue with. (But damn does ya boy get dehydrated) Also they know about each other but have never met. either way all in all they’re both beautiful and amazing women and I have no idea what I’m doing at this point in my life and I need help. 

TLDR; I’m in love with a stripper (No seriously) and a girl in the military, and both are my closest friends I have no idea what to do with this. I have no idea what I’m doing with my love life please send help.",2019-07-07 02:23:50,11,2,relationship_advice
614,ca0m4q,messyassbitch,I'm Borderline and think I've created a toxic relationship because of my issues. Break-up or fix it together?,"Throwaway account because I’m embarrassed. Sorry if this is long winded and rambling, I’ve never done this before.

I should preface this by saying I am almost positive I have Borderline Personality Disorder. It has been suggested by previous partners and my research confirms it. I waited for it to pass but it didn't really.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year. We met in a different city than the one we currently live in. Our relationship progressed very quickly (all of mine do...) and he ended up moving with me back to my home town within a month of sleeping together. We were friends for 4 months before that, acquaintances for 2 years before that. Our relationship has been great overall, but we have some communication issues and have since the beginning. They often turn into fights but this is not out of character for me in relationships. In the beginning we were both drinking a lot and this definitely played into it. Frankly I can’t remember most of the shit we fight about but usually I'm overly emotional and angry about something and he's condescending and not empathetic so one small thing escalates into a huge argument. I would always wake up the next day, hung over, feeling so horrible about the whole thing. I felt like there must be something fundamentally wrong with our relationship and me if this keeps happening. He wasn’t unaffected exactly but was able to brush it off MUCH easier than me, and insisted we got too drunk but aren’t bad for each other. I almost always felt like I was the one instigating these fights and felt very guilty about it so the fact that he was able to forgive so easily was relieving, but I still hated it and wanted it to stop.

I don’t drink anymore and he only has a couple beers at home while watching a show and that’s it. Our fighting has reduced significantly as a result, but we still do fight, just not as explosively as when we were drinking. However, it feels like we have the same issues, but they’re more repressed without the alcohol... if you know what I mean? I get the sense we both go on the defensive when we feel a disagreement coming on and this actually makes the bickering worse when I’m never trying to fight to begin with. 

“Splitting” is a big thing with Borderline where you view people as all good or all bad based on any new evidence and you latch onto this. I feel like this also fuels our fights because if he does something I don’t like, it can go into my brain as something WAY bigger and more meaningful than it is and it’s exhausting for both of us.

I’ve been reading this forum a lot lately and relate to TOO MANY of the “toxic” people/relationships that everyone calls out in the comments. All of my relationships have been very unstable and I’ve always blamed myself for this. One time things got so bad after a break up that I became severely depressed and anxious and didn't want to go outside or to events alone because I was terrified of running into an ex. I didn’t understand why I was acting out so much and struggling to maintain stable relationships and a stable sense of self. 

I’ve recently come to terms with the fact that being Borderline sometimes causes me to act abusively at times without even realizing it (I promise you it is not out of malice but an inability to think clearly while spiraling). I’ve brought this all up my current boyfriend but he says he doesn’t think I act abusive towards him. I said I appreciate that but that I don’t feel good about the relationship dynamic that I feel like I’ve created and am perpetuating. He’s asked me to call it out next time I feel like the toxic dynamic is at play and I agreed. This is all great and seems like we could turn our relationship around right? I haven’t mentioned here yet that periodically (perhaps every 2 weeks or month?) I get a little distant (possibly because of splitting?) and I question our relationship and whether I should just be alone instead. But he’s so sweet and supportive that I don’t want to throw a good thing away over a weird feeling? Sometimes I fantasize about being alone but other times I really love him. Sometimes I wonder if our relationship will even survive if I continue down this path of self-growth and evolution... Will I be over it?

I’m tired of feeling and acting crazy (what feels like) all the time and I want to change!!! I plan on going to therapy this month but my question is: Should we work this out together or are we in too deep and would it be better to heal independently? I’m really really conflicted and taking a break isn’t an easy option because we share a 1 bedroom and he basically moved here for me...

Please don't attack me! I do that enough in my head already. I probably sound crazy but this is definitely not all my doing, we play into each other's issues and that's part of the problem. We attract what we are not what we want...

615,ca1uap,wtfimsad,"BF wants to take a ""not-a-break"" break: sad and confused","My BF of two years sat me down and told me tonight that we should go a bit without seeing each other. Our relationship has been wonderful, we've always communicated well, we've always made each other happy. He told me that he is afraid of hurting me and that when he is around me, he is only able to think about me, as a result he isn't able to watch after himself and his actions as easily and worries about causing me harm (emotional, never physical). It felt like being broken up with. 

He keeps saying it isn't a break, we will still be dating and still text, but we won't see each other. I am more sad than  have ever been, and I'm having trouble understanding what else this could be aside from a break. Does anybody have experience with something like this? How did it go??

618,ca3mrt,Sarahkisekise452,I (25F) can't cum despite my bf's (24M) best efforts,"TW: Sexual Assault and Rape

I'm not actually sure of how legitimate triggers and stuff are but I'll put that there just in case it is real.

Me and my bf have been having unfulfilling sex, he's been able to cum but I haven't been able to. We've been dating for a year now and sexually active during the majority of it.
He is becoming embarrassed and insecure over it and we've tried everything, we've looked up every remedy and position but nothing's working.
I get fairly aroused and feel a decent amount of pleasure but I never even feel close to orgasm. I try to tell him that some girls don't but I'm hiding a sort of secret.

At ages 12-16 my dad and, on occasion, his friends would molest and rape me. 
When I was 13ish I started becoming aroused at their touches and when I was 14 I actually orgasmed.
After that I began regularly reaching orgasm at his assaults. I've never been able recreate it outside of it with other men, women or by myself. 
My boyfriend hasn't been told about any of this and he doesn't know that I ever was forced into intercourse.

It's both embarrassing and shameful but typing it out is actually getting me aroused. I love my bf with all of my heart and he's the love of my life so it's frustrating that my body is acting like my rapist dad is better. 

I've found myself fantasizing about my bf assaulting me too which leaves me disgusted and upset.
I know there's such thing as rape role-play and I know that might work but I definitely couldn't, the entire situation is already upsetting and actually seeing my bf pretend to rape me would probably not help, even if I do orgasm it wouldn't be worth it if it took that amount of bad imagery and shame.

Does anyone else have this problem? If so what did you do to solve it? 
If the only solution is rapeplay then is there a way to increase my bf's confidence without orgasming? Should I fake some?",2019-07-07 05:55:33,6,1,relationship_advice
619,ca0gr1,valleoderso,I feel like i'm in a movie or so.. Three guys are intrested in me!,"Okay, so for the record. I'm just an average girl and i'm not really popular. I have a group of good friends but never more. But recently I got in touch with an old friend and his new friends and also met some people over the subreddits r/needafriend and r/makenewfriendshere . Also I'm 16, because my age may affect how you'll think about the situations. 

I haven't had a lot of luck with relationships and crushes, so some month ago I just thought to myself, that I wouldn't try getting in relationships anymore and that i'll just enjoy being single. I know that may sound like a stupid statement from a 16 year old, but my last boyfriend was emotionally abusive and so dating got pretty hard for me at that point. 

But anyways, now to my situation: 
About a month and a half ago, my former best friend and the ex of my now best friend (let's call him Collin) texted me, because of my birthday and after three years not talking to each other, we decided we should meet again, in the group we hang around somw years ago. So we planned that meeting together and eventually met like two weeks later. 

At the same time, his best friend (let's name him Danny) got my number from him and started texting me. It was just nonesense we were texting, but since the moment Danny saw a picture of me, he seemed intrested, without really knowing my personality. Danny often would ask me what kind of guys I like and if I had a boyfriend. But we didn't text that often. 

Then the meeting happened, we drank a bit and Collin brought me home. I wasn't really drunk but he insisted of staying with me and looking after me. We talked a lot and he stayed until 12 am, went home for maybe half an hour and immediatly came back, when I said I wasn't feeling well. But that was pretty much it. 

After that, I was sometimes hanging out on discord with Collin and Danny and just playing some games together. And in that time I met this one guy on r/makenewfriendshere (let's call him Jake). We just clicked and we talked for maybe two weeks now but he pretty fast fell for me. Usually I don't realize when someone likes me, but that time it was just obvious, because Jake told me about 'a girl he met on reddit, that he liked' and then told me things that perfectly matched me. 

While I just met Jake, Danny asked me out on a date. I haven't met him irl yet, so I just changed the subject and tried to avoid answering his question. But some days later, he messaged me in the middle of the night. He told me that Collin had a crush on me and that he knew him for some years now and he could tell when Collin liked someone. I didn't believed him, so he told me to ask Collin himself so I did. Big mistake, because now Collin confessed to me. 

I was suprised and confused, so I thought I'll try to get an advice from a friend, so I just asked Jake on his opinion on this situation. I didn't knew he liked me, but I could quickly tell after I told him about Danny and Collin, because he got upset and I regreted telling him. 

Jake confessed to me some days later and since then it wasn't the same between us. I miss our conversations, but I know we can't go back to how it was before. I haven't talked to Collin since, I thought about asking to meet up but I was too scared. And Danny only messaged me and asked if I wanted to game with him. 

So now I'm asking for any kind of advice on the situation! 

Should I talk to them? Separately? Should I meet up with them and maybe bring some friends too, so it won't get that awkward? Should I reject them all or try dating one of then? What would you do in my situation? 

Any advice would help me..",2019-07-06 23:56:31,8,3,relationship_advice
620,ca1oyj,hasorand0m,I feel like girlfriend does not have my back.,"Me 27 gf 32 

Went out to eat out at our favorite restaurant.

We were sat down by the hostess.

And our server was being rude to me.

When i was talking to him, i felt very uncomfortable.

And when i was talking to him, he was insulting me  by making fun of my weight.

Saying “oh you like cake snacks?”

And my girlfriend didn’t even interrupt him to defend me.

When i asked her about it later she said “oh i just wanted the conversation to end so i let you two just talk it out”

I feel like she knows him low key and does not want to ruin her relationship with him and mine so she stays out of it, even though it is my first time meeting him.

But Deep down in my gut i know she knows him .

Because he did say to her “i think i know you from somewhere”

Then asked her where she works at and she tells him full details where she works at.

And then i saw the sparkle in her eyes as if he had given her a diamond ring.

And when the bill came. I paid it in full
 
Then i proceeded to ask my gf “what do you think is a fair tip?”

She says “your the man you decide “

I feel that sentence verifies she actually knows him personally so that when they do get together behind my back she can say “no that tip was all him “


I dont think my gf had my back, and it hurts.

621,ca6s29,Suha2565,I (F18) want my mehr to be at least 600k. I had a fight with my fiancé.,"**Mehr: is a mandatory payment, in the form of money or possessions paid by the groom, to the bride at the time of marriage, that legally becomes her property. I have the freedom to ask what ever I want.  We are muslim btw.**

Basically, I told him that I want my mehr to be 600k, I also told him that in the contract (our Islamic marriage contract) I will write:

\-I don't want you/him to marry on me or to get a second, third, fourth wife.

\-that I will work, study when I want and I can also stop working and studying when I want.

\-that he must promise me to not try to stop me when I want to go out. that I have the ultimate freedom to go out without permission like he has.

\-that we will live in the house my father bought me, its also under my name

\-that I will not cook nor clean, we will have to get a cook and cleaner.

\-that we will start having children after 4 years.

\- also that we will have 3x sex a week. And that i will choose what days. Ok this sounds WEIRD I know. but in islam the wife must always be ready and not refuse when he asks her for sex. If she refuses and she isn't ill, then the angles will curse her all night. So I don't want any headache from all this cursing and husband stuff. I just want to have sex when I REALLY want I don't want to force myself. I know myself very well, I can only do something when I am feeling it or want it, other than that I cant force myself. If I force myself I will become depressed.

Is there any problem with this? I don't see any problem at all, but he was really mad for the first time. He even asked if I really loved him. I mean its not about love, I just want to feel **secure**. I have seen a lot of muslim women end up in a depressed married life, so I always promised myself that I will do anything to get all my rights.

Am I really wrong? he is wealthy btw so he can provide all this. English isn't my first language. I am 18.",2019-07-07 13:23:18,102,0,relationship_advice
622,ca3kx0,melsmelsmels,My SO doesn’t wanna watch movies that I wanna watch but I watch the movies he wants to watch with him.,"Hey guys! So just a quick insight, at the beginning of our relationship my bf and I would watch movies together and it wasn’t a big deal if he didn’t want to watch a movie that I wanted to watch but over the past recent months, he’s began to not watch ANY movies that I wanna watch with him. He’ll either call them “cringy” or “boring”. 

So today we went to watch Spider Man: Far From Home (Not a big fan of the new Spider-Man but this movie was amazing! I recommend it.) and I saw that The Lion King was gonna be released this month and I told him “oh can we come watch this movie?” And he just made a disgusted face and just turned away. I felt embarrassed and sad. We have came to the movies everytime he wants to watch a damn movie but when I ask to watch a movie, whether it’s in the theatres or at home, it’s a simple no. 

What can I do to make it come to his attention that what he’s doing is unfair?

623,ca3kt2,wela_wahine,Is it possible that my boyfriend of 10 months just isn’t into me and only with me out of convenience?,"I don’t know why I’ve been feeling so insecure lately, but I’m having these thoughts that my boyfriend might not be into me. 

We’ve been together 10 months. I’ll mention some positive things- He is very respectful towards me, we haven’t even gotten into a fight yet. When we are together, he is very much “there”, focuses on me, is very affectionate physically, hugs me, kisses me, the other night he just held me through the night. We both have kids from a previous marriage and have recently met them. The kids get along great. When first entering this relationship, we both told each other we haven’t introduced our kids to anyone we’ve dated and wouldn’t do that with anyone unless we’re serious about them. Well here we are 10 months later and we have done just that.

Some negative things that get me thinking- He’s a workaholic. And I mean, when he’s not with his kids, he is consumed with his work that sometimes I feel like he’s absent and doesn’t always reach out first. He’s also not verbally affectionate. AT ALL. No sweet words, no compliments, no pet names. Nothing. He will reciprocate if I tell him I miss him or can’t wait to see him, but won’t say it first. No “I love you”, but none from me either, only because I’m afraid I won’t get the response I want and it will bring me down. 

Like I mentioned though, a totally different man when we’re together, he shows how much he cares in that sense. What got me thinking tonight though was that the other night, he downloaded an app on his TV which requires a paid subscription, which I have. I offered to share with him a couple of months ago so no big deal, but he texted me the other night just to ask about the download and my credentials. Fine. Then today, I hear nothing from him, granted he is with his kids so I’m not expecting it, but he texts me tonight. Not to say hello, not even a conversation starter, not to ask how I’m doing, but his very first question is if I’m watching the event on the app. I tell him no, and ask him if he was. He said he was trying to while the kids were playing but it requires a purchase in addition to my paid subscription. I had to explain how it works. But basically this made me feel like crap that this is the only reason he feels compelled to reach out to me. For his benefit. Am I reading too much into this? With all the things I’ve listed about (positive and negative), does it sound like he’s just not really into me after all and with me out of convenience?",2019-07-07 05:48:23,1,1,relationship_advice

I clicked with this girl unlike anyone else I've met before. We have a lot in common, share the same humor and generally got along before we started dating.

But since we're dating she's started showing a different side to her. In a strange way she's very demanding.

She wants me to be an asshole to her half the time. It's exhausting and after a year I don't know what to do about it.

To get what she wants she deliberately starts arguments or tries to get under my skin.

She knows which topics get me worked up, but when I realise what she's trying to do she finds new ways.

One of the ways is that she will bother me while cooking because I'm passionate about it. Even going so far as to ruin the food just to annoy me. 

&amp;#x200B;

She expects me to be controlling/dominant to an extreme in most of our relationship. She expects me to read her mind and make every decision accordingly.

She has high expectations like our vacation which does not fit our budget at all.

I recently went through a bad break up with a girl I’ve fallen for pretty hard, and her feelings were similar. I did something pretty shitty that led to the split. 

Since she decided she couldn’t be with me post-incident, she has been messaging me every day. Completely normal and friendly conversation like nothing happened, minus some flirtation. A couple weeks of this have passed, with her saying this isn’t something she can get passed, while I have made it known I’m wanting to do anything I can to make it work. 

This week, she was complaining about being lonely, and fished for an invite out with me and my friends. We all go out, and she leaves a bit early with some of her friends. I tell her that it was nice seeing her, I miss her, etc. She invited me over to her house to cuddle, and I stupidly agreed. We didn’t talk much (it was late) but she said she missed me while crying. We fell asleep holding each other. 

The next day, I do something sweet for her, say goodbye, and leave. I didn’t hear from her the next day. Eventually she reaches out and we talk for a bit. She said she still can’t seeing anything because she’s heartbroken and it’s so fresh, but that not talking at all hurts too much, and returned to just messaging me all day as if everything was normal.

634,c9iw27,mapofatlanta,My(23 f) boyfriend(25 M) of 5 years just passed away and now his ex gf (25 f) won’t stop posting on social media how much she misses him,"I dated my boyfriend from the time I was 18-23 and he was 20-25. We met when I moved away for college and bonded because we were both originally  from the same area.

We’ve lived together for 4 years and have had an amazing, beautiful relationship. We grew up together, experienced being broke together, losing loved ones together,  adopting pets together, getting our first grown up jobs together, seeing the world together, everything both good and bad, we were in it together and it always felt so right. 

We had an incredibly trusting relationship. We knew each other’s phone locks and used each other’s phones all the time. If he was in the shower and his phone would ring I would tell him and he’d respond “can you grab that for me?” Looking through each other’s phone was never a thing, because we used each other’s phones so often. I never once saw anything weird or questionable.

my boyfriend died nearly two weeks ago in a car accident and everything has gone to shit since. Besides the overwhelming pain and loneliness I feel all the time, i also have been dealing with his ex gf, who dated from 16-18, going on Facebook and Twitter everything saying how much she misses him and he was her true love and how much she misses talking to him everyday and all this bullshit.

I’ve never met his ex gf, but I had heard of her. As far as I knew, she was just a typical highschool sweetheart and that’s it. They dated when they were sophomores and broke up before college because he went away and she stayed. Nothing special.

The only reason I knew about the posts is because an old friend of mine who still lives in our home town actually works with her at a Restaurant. She had said she hadn’t been going to work and it’s because her bf passed away and she screen shorted all the stuff she was posting on Facebook and showed me. I was in disbelief.

I have no idea what to believe or think right now. She keeps posting stuff like “I miss hearing your voice” when I’m pretty sure they haven’t talked in YEARS. I don’t want to sound naive but it’s hard to believe he was cheating on me with her because we lived together and were together ALL the time. We had similar work schedules and loved spending time together. Besides the fact I would use his phone all the time and never once saw anything weird, i truly don’t know when he would have the time to be texting/calling her because we were always always together.

I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. As painful as this already is, I can’t help but think what if he was cheating on me with her. I know this is the last thing that should be in my mind, i just feel so stupid and don’t know what to believe. I don’t understand why she would just lie about this though. He has pictures with and of me everywhere, and everyone knew we were in serious relationship. I understand that she might be grieving too, but I feel like she is purposely trying to make me look dumb and trying to gain all the sympathy as the “grieving girlfriend” when they broke up nearly 10 years ago.

635,ca1ffy,KJM31422,"Me (M24) visiting home for the weekend, got into fight with step mom, I'm not sure how to react to some things she said, I'm just baffled.","A little background: my step mom and I have never seen eye to eye, we've a tumultuous but by no means terrible relationship. She and her daughter moved in with my dad and when I was around 10. As a kid I lied a lot and snuck around and she absolutely hated that and always called me out on it, but she has a pattern of waiting until there are not witnesses to say really awful things to me and often  when I try to stand up for myself I feel like I'm bullied into admitting fault so she can ""forgive me"". Also my dad was recently diagnosed with cancer but has been in remission and is close to beating it for the time being.
 

Now to what happened today: I'm in town visiting for 4th of July weekend, everything has been going as expected so far, the usual family Dynamic of teasing each other etc... We're in the desert and I do not do well with heat at all so I haven't been sleeping well. This morning my dad and step mom woke up and said that were going to go to a lake nearby for the day to explore. I felt that I had made it clear in previous I didn't want to be outside, but I went along with it cause I was about 30% awake and didn't have the mental capacity to put up a fight at The moment. 


We got to the lake after a rather arduous car ride and tensions weren't particularly high but I was grumpy cause of the heat and not sleeping. When we get there we look into a boat tour (I'm not really a huge fan of water or boats) so when they guide tells us the tour will be an hour and a half I ball and say I don't want to go, my step gets mad because she really wanted to go, I offer to stay on shore so her and my dad can go but the damage was apparently done. we get into an argument where I tell them I feel like I'm never heard when I say I don't like doing something that they like to do, and that they don't seem to understand how I don't like some things I did as a kid or that they think I like. 


It escalates 


My step mom launches into insulting me and telling me that the way I went about telling them I didn't want to go on the boat was manipulative, tells me I'm always manipulative in the family Dynamic so that I have power in the situation, and equate my aversion to water and boats as a sad and pathetic fear of life and aversion to nature, tells me that my not doing well in the heat is bullshit and basically accused me of lying and faking everything to steal the power from her. When I try to defend myself she attacks more and essentially bullies me into admitting that yes I was trying to manipulate the group dynamic so that I would have the most power in the situation (I don't feel like this is true at all). 


We're driving home still screaming at each when my dad pulls over the car and says he needs some air because he thinks he may be having an anxiety attack from us arguing. My step takes this opportunity of my dad being out of the car to launch into a massive, toxic fully trip and say what essentially amounts to ""it's your fault he's having an anxiety attack and walking around out there in the 105 degree weather, he may be dying. You don't care about making him happy or him being happy otherwise you wouldn't have started this whole argument""


I have absolutely no clue what to say, so before I do something rash, I get out of the car and go sit on the side of the road to have an what I now think was an actual panic attack. My dad asks what happened I say ""I can't do this anymore, I'm taking an Uber home"". He goes over and pulls the car up where I'm sitting and tells me very nicely to please get in and my step says something bitchy and vehemently denies what she said about my dad to guilt trip me into seeing the entire situation was ""my fault"" 


I still have no idea how to react... My only thought is how dare she. How dare she use my fathet potentially dying soon against me in an argument, that is a very real possibility and something I think about almost every day. I'm still I think in shock - this is not the first time she's said something like this to me, and she has a pattern of saying horribly toxic things to people only when there are no witnesses. 


Im not even sure what I'm looking for from this post, I jsut needed to say this all in some capacity, my heart is pounding out of my chest even as I type this. I jsut don't even know what to think.


Tl;Dr step mom and I have rough but not terrible relationship, she has a history of being toxic to me and others when there are no witnesses. Got into an argument on family vacation, she accused me of manipulating the family, bullied me into admitting fault so she can ""forgive me"" and used my father's cancer and declining health as a guilt tactic in our argument when there were no witnesses, vehemently denies it around my dad. I don't even know what to feel or think...


Edit: to clarify, yes I know I should have spoken up in the morning about not wanting to go to the lake, I'm under no impressions that I handled the situation perfectly, or even that well.",2019-07-07 01:37:41,0,2,relationship_advice
636,ca1f7i,Alin1010,Me (15F) and a friend of mine (19M),"For the viewers who are currently reading my post, I wanted to know if this boy likes me or not. To put my long story short, I'm a Freshmen in High School and I went to volunteer in a summer school and there I met a college male student who works there. Everyday when the kids that we tutor finish their classwork, he would come to sit by me and we would talk about school life and our favorite subjects etc... But recently, he's been bringing up topics like girlfriends and having feelings for someone. He told me he has a girlfriend who went to my dream college when he asked me about me dream college. He also told me a lot about his dreams of being able to work for google since he majors in comp. sci. Out of Jealously, I blurted out that I also had a Boyfriend when I actually don't. Then he started telling me how he had his first love when he was 14 and I lied that I had just began dating this year. He also showed me many pictures of him when he was on vacation and some of the prototypes he made for projects in school. During lunch breaks, he would ask me  if I wanted to eat or if I would be hungry if i don't eat. To be honest, I had a feeling that he likes me, but I'm still doubt it because of the fact that he has a girlfriend already. I feel like we have a lot in common and we were always coincidently adding on to one another. For example, once I said that I would climb a ladder because I'm not afraid of height, he told me he was afraid of heights... I just wanted you guys' opinions on this. Do you think he would like me or not? If not, or if so, please explain. I genuinely want to know the answer. Thx for reading!",2019-07-07 01:36:56,5,2,relationship_advice
637,ca3d8m,Holycrail,"[21 M] In a slump, kinda need reassurance, kinda need a slap in the face."," 

Hey internet,

These last 2 weeks have been absolute torture and i'm hoping for ""something"" by venting into the void that is Reddit. So without further a do..

I met this guy on tinder at the beginning of the year. He's 38, and lives 220km away from me. We dated for the first three months of the year, until he confided in me that the age difference makes him uncomfortable and the distance was an issue to him, and told me he wanted to remain friends. After i distanced myself i thought i was well enough about the situation to conduct a friendship. We planned a camping trip for a week, just him and I. When the trip was over and i was home i sent him a text pretty much confessing i still had romantic feelings for him. He suggested it would be best for both of us if we ""didn't talk for the time being"" because its ""unfair to both of us.""

It's barely been a week and all i want to do is speak with him, but i cant because i don't want to further destroy what we have left of a relationship. I feel genuinely hurt, and its been taking a toll on my health. I haven't been able to stomach a meal in the last week, and have been living off of pretty much solely water.

On top of that my car decided it wanted to die (some engine failure my mechanic says isnt worth trying to fix). This has me stressed out because i need a car to be able to make it to work, and ive already missed 4 days of work following my week off when i went camping. So my job is at jeopardy.

I stupidly made an appointment to have a dealership pick me up tomorrow and discuss options, knowing well that i only have 700$ to my name, and im too anxious to call and cancel. plus, even if i did have money for payments and insurance, once come September i wont be able to make payments because i decided i need to go back to school.

Which brings up my next issue. I'm unsure if i want to go to school for what i signed up for (Heavy duty Equipment.) I already did my schooling for the first portion of a plumbing certificate, and found out quickly it wasn't for me, and backed out of the field, and i really don't want to take a student loan out and have it happen again. It's hard because i dont know what i want to do, or really what im good at that interests me (i know.. another 21 year old that doesnt know what to do with himself.)

So i'm laying in bed, pit in my stomach. Can't drink, smoking weed hasn't helped, hell i even went and talked to a therapist yesterday morning, and im only feeling like things are getting worse.

So here i am asking for help, or maybe just somebody to help me see something from a different perspective. Sorry if any parts of this was confusing, im more than happy to explain the things i mentioned in more detail, but that the jist of it. But i'd like to emphasize that the thing thats bumming me out the most (weirdly?) is the guy who broke my heart.  

Thanks in Advance.",2019-07-07 05:20:17,1,1,relationship_advice
638,ca1edn,relationsadvicepls,Should I (F22) pay him (M23) back?,"BACKSTORY


In the spring of 2017 I started dating a man that would end up verbally, emotionally and physically abusing me for over a year while we were both in college. I finally found the courage to leave at the end of the summer in 2018. 


Over my 2018 fall semester and winter break he basically lied, harassed and tried to manipulate me into being with him again including suicide threats, blaming, insults and general threatening, sending flowers and promises of going to therapy that never came true. I stayed relatively strong, ignored mostly (not smart to block the number for RO purposes) and put up with the crap he spread. Then, halfway through spring semester, we bumped into each other at a bar and I gave him the opportunity to explain how he changed, him mentioning that he did in fact go to therapy.


As anyone who has been in an abusive relationship knows, the abusive partner lies. A lot. No he had not been to therapy or changed in the slightest but I was still trying to get over what he had done to me and was not over him yet. I gave him the millionth chance and after a honeymoon phase he went back to being the same abusive jerk he’s always been. So eventually I cut off all contact, blocked him on almost everything and have not heard a word since. 


DILEMMA


So, while I was still working out if he was lying to me I went through a rough patch where a lot of my money was going to unexpected school fees. I had always refused help, but there was one time he insisted I borrow $50 and get it back to him whenever I was able. I agreed and had every intention of paying him back as I’ve now received my security deposit. 


Yesterday, I was speaking with a friend and mentioned having him blocked on everything except Venmo. When I explained why she said, “You don’t owe him anything because of the way he treated you. Block him and move on. He’s a horrible person and you’ve done enough for him. Don’t open that door again.”


So, I thought I’d reach out to the internet because you all love giving harsh, honest opinions. I don’t think paying him back and then blocking him on Venmo would “open a door,” but my judgement with him is shit. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 


He fucked up my life and I’ll be working through shit for a long time, but I mean it’s his money. My friend just has me rethinking. Do I pay him back or just blow it off?",2019-07-07 01:34:18,7,2,relationship_advice
639,ca3d65,awaykshckaksjdjthrow,I [19M] am considering breaking up with my [18F] girlfriend of over a year and a half because I’ve fallen out of love and have feelings for someone else. How can I approach this in the least hurtful and harmful way possible?,"Before I start, I realize right off the bat that a) I’m not at all the good guy in this situation, b) there is no way in which this WON’T hurt her, and c) I don’t expect her to still like me or want to be friends with me. I just want to figure out how to do this in a way where she gets hurt the least, because she doesn’t deserve that

TL;DR at the bottom

I met my gf when we were both sophomores, and we started dating our junior year. We recently graduated. For the first year and several months, things were amazing and we felt in love. I was naïve. I know that highschool relationships rarely last

About 3 and a half months ago, my gf started having second thoughts about our relationship, and began to close herself off and distance herself from me. This was a very difficult time for me, as I am a very affectionate person and I need that in a relationship. Over time, without realizing, I began to fantasize and crush on other people, specifically someone that I became friends with at the end of my junior year

Now, a month into summer, I realize that I have really fallen for this new girl, and no longer feel the same about my gf. About a week ago I had a serious talk about how things need to change in our relationship if it is to continue, and my gf understood, apologizing for how she’d acted and the things she’d done (the specifics of what she did aren’t important here - only that it was toxic behavior and she’s apologized profusely)

The first two or so days afterwards, things were great, but after that I noticed that she had already started moving backwards into old behaviors. My patience is thin and my entire friend group agrees that I should break up with her. Last night, my gf came over, and I didn’t enjoy myself near as much as I used to. I simply didn’t have fun. To me, this is the nail in the coffin. I plan on breaking up with her next week, if not this one

All that being said, I truly believe that she’s not a bad person. She’s just done things that I can’t get over, and continues to do some of them. We’re both young and have plenty of time to grow and develop and mature. We simply weren’t ready for a serious relationship. She doesn’t deserve to be hurt, so I just wanna know how I can break things off in the least hurtful way possible

TL;DR - I’ve fallen for another girl after my gf closed herself off from me for months. Despite promises to change, my gf seems to be the same, so I want to end things. How can I do this without hurting her too much?",2019-07-07 05:20:01,1,1,relationship_advice
640,ca3co0,lacedbrain,"I (22F) made negative comments about my ex, and my bf (21M) said that those comments remind him of the issues he has with me.","Last night, my bf and I were having a heart to heart about our relationship. It started off with him talking about his insecurities - he struggles with depression, anxiety and has low self esteem. He told me that I'm a ""constant reminder"" about how shit he is doing in life because I have problems with him often. These problems I have are generally stemming from my own insecurities created by him a while back as he used to make me feel not cool enough for him or inadequate. This is one downside to our relationship and I'm trying to work on it.  


However, then my ex (I'll call him Billy) came up in convo.. and we discussed why I broke up with him which was because he was too insecure and wasn't helping me grow in life, I said that I got sick of being with someone who was stagnant and didn't want to go anywhere and I was way too young to feel stuck in life. Then my bf said ""those comments you made about Billy remind me of you, you don't seem to be doing cool things or be interested in going travelling.""   


I got incredibly defensive and upset, I explained to him how would I have time to go travelling if I'm studying towards a degree and sarcastically said ""oh I'm not doing cool things, am I? I'm not doing x y z"" and listed off some things that I'm personally proud of. He then went on to say ""I feel like I help you grow and that you don't help me grow"". I didn't understand this really, because I truly feel like I help him be a better person. He then said he feels like he's getting old and that it scares him, that he doesn't want to be boring and that he's never lived with a girlfriend properly before. He said that I need to be doing new things with him, and possibly going out for drinks more often with him, and complained that about me not really being into drinking. I'm much more of an adventurous person and would prefer to be going on long walks, or going on hikes but every time we do that it's up to me to plan it and organise the food and equipment - it gets tiring when he's not equally interested just because he'd rather be out partying/drinking. He also often goes on about how social humans are and that we need to be out talking to more people. I just couldn't care less about having stacks of friends..  


How do I go about having a further conversation about the above? I'm genuinely still upset that he feels like I'm not enough fun, but I also truly don't have much time to be planning amazing things and there's no reason why he can't do that for us either. He's much more into drinking and that his most favourite activity, and unfortunately I don't really care for it. I feel like he truly mainly wants me to be less of a nature geek and wants me to become more laid back and ""cool"".  


TLDR; my boyfriend would love me to help him become a better person, and for me to be more of a social butterfly, but I'm stuck on how to do so and I'm also hurt that he seems unhappy with me. How do I talk to him about this?",2019-07-07 05:18:16,1,1,relationship_advice

I can’t talk about any of my feelings or experiences and get any real reflection/empathy back. I ask him about his childhood and relationships and he never had close friends or remembers his childhood well. It’s like he doesn’t have feelings. When he explains how his “feelings” towards things are, it’s all just a thought process and it makes my stomach turn. It’s like being with a robot. He’s caring and willing to do the motions of relationship things. We get along well now after this time because he likes me a lot and thinks I’m the best. He says I’m like the closest person he’s had in his life- but that feels crazy to hear because I feel better connected and have more meaningful talks with any other friends I’ve had til now.

643,c9xlhg,AliceThrewtheGlass,Boyfriend(30) just dropped a $15k debt in my (28f) lap. Hes been hiding it from me for the last year.,"I've spent all of my life avoiding debt. I went thru a really shitty time in my early 20s where I had to have emergency surgery on my jaw and I got a small debt of $1000, with a crazy high interest rate. It took me years to pay off but when I did I swore I'd never put myself in that situation again. Last night my boyfriend of over 2 years told me he has racked up $15,000 in credit card debt since we've been together. 

I had no idea this was happening. He works a really good job and we take small vacations about twice a year, to neighboring states where I pay half of all the expenses. Over the last year we have had one date night a week and I pay for about 1 or 2 a month, he insists on paying all the other ones. 


Hes mentioned in passing before that he needs to be more careful with his spending, and I've tried to respect that and have offered to pay for more of our outings but he always turns me down. 

I'm hurt that he didnt think he could share this with me sooner, I'm mad he lied to me about it for over a year, and I feel guilty for not noticing sooner and letting him pay for so much stuff. 

We had plans to get married in the next year or so and to start a family soon after that. We wont be able to really save for a wedding now that our money will be going to this debt. Now I'm having doubts about his ability to be responsible with his money enough to be a father, which makes me feel guilty even feeling like that. 

I'm at a loss.

Edit: He says the money has gone twords eating out when I'm at work and not home, and twords his lunches, and going out for drinks with his friends etc... he also said that a decent sum of it has gone twords me or our time together, dinners, movies, gas for beach days.

644,ca3bp1,PeeVinC,My (23M) girlfriend (20F) wants to break up with me because she does not feel the same anymore,"When we started our relationship she started to set expectations. It was kinda mature to hear it. Sadly, I didn't know it were all words. One of the many things we set was that our relationship is something thay is gonna be serious and that she's tired of looking for men that just makes her a piece of shit. I told her that what makes a commitment work is a significant experience between each other that, if remembered, it would make us strong during the cold days. I guess.. She had her own experience but she must have forgotten it. then.. it must not have been so significant at all. 

We have been together for 2 years now and we have been through a lot of things together. Traveled to some place together. Then the time came when she had to go home far from where we usedl to be (just at the same county, Philippines) for about 3 months. She isn't good at communication in long distance relationships. She used to get mad about little things.. like when we play in an online game. She blames everything on me. I am certainly not a bad player. During our kinda long distant relationship we really weren't that well. She says doesn't feel the same intimacy as she feels with me before. I did nothing wrong between us. I don't do anything against her. In fact on about our 6th month together, she cheated, had sex with her ex, and I accepted her, I understood her. I don't get why she can't appreciate something that hurts so much for me to forgiver her.

Now she finds wrong in everything I do. She is going to law school and I just want to set everything well before she goes busy on law school. I thought everything would be good now that we are together again. But I am so sad that.. She told me she didn't feel anything when we had sex one night. (I remember, that's the same thing why she has finally moved on with her ex, and yes she cheated on me, had sex with her ex to know if she is still in to him or not, which could be determined if she would feel good pleasure while having sex.. nvm that I have forgiven her and educated her that the means is wrong for the certain end.) Here I am telling her that if she's not satisfied anymore we could spice things back up. She told me being in bed isn't the problem. I told her I see the same thing too and I see that perhaps it is something with me not being able to give so much effort for her to feel loved. I am damn broke. I just got a decent job and I haven't get my first pay yet till 3 more days. I told her that perhaps we could spice things back up by going somewhere and spending time together and catching up as honest as we can be and have deep talks and all. It is something we lost for a long time of dull talk on the phone when she was away. Despite all the positivity I am trying to shower on her, she doesn't seem to be pleased or atleast cheered up or something to look forward too between the both of us.

I want to know how things could be better now. What are other things I could do aside from spicing things up or is there something else I could do to make things better? is there something wrong with me? because I can't accept we are just breaking up because she doesn't feel the same anymore. it can't be just it.

TLDR: My girlfriend wants to break up with me because she doesn't feel the same as she used to be with me and I want to know how could I save our relationship.",2019-07-07 05:14:57,1,0,relationship_advice

Yesterday (Friday), I called him to chat and he said he was driving a state over to visit all his old fraternity buddies and the girls they used to hang out with. That’s fine, he has a super demanding job and never gets to enjoy himself. However, at the end of the phone call, he says “Okay bye I’ll talk to you Monday” and then I get upset. I asked why that long and he said it’s because he’s going on a weekend bender and won’t be able to talk. 

That really annoyed me because he does this every weekend he drinks where he’ll just pretend I don’t exist until he’s sober again. Am I being too controlling in still wanting him to reach out? Just to check in or say hi? I know he wants to spend time with his friends and I respect that but I’m wondering if it’s normal and okay to take a break from talking to drink with your friends for a weekend?

648,ca3a4y,magnusderius,Help on moving forward after a breakup?,"Hey guys, 
Recently my girlfriend of 15 months decided to end our relationship. One day, she texted me and asked me if I was busy, I said no, and she asked me if I wanted to hang out. I told her yes, and she said to wait, and that she would pick me up because she had to drop off stuff at the post office anyways. 

Eventually she gets to my house and I come out and get in her car. I asked her how she was doing and she said not very good. I asked her what was wrong and she almost immediately started crying and said she wanted to break up. She explained she felt awful because she felt like she was lying to me. I asked her what she meant, and she said she felt she was lying every time she said 'I love you', and that she kept going back and forth and she didn't want to hurt me by lying to me anymore. I gave her a hug and wiped away some of her tears and told her everything is gonna be okay, you can't change the way you feel, bit that's okay too. I asked her how long she felt like this and she said she didn't know. She also stated she wanted to stay friends and that she didnt want to go on bad terms. I told her it was alright, and gave her another hug. Eventually I got out of the car, told her to stay safe, and made it back inside.

Now I'm turning to you guys for help, because I'm not sure what to do.

Please, any advice is appreciated tremendously.",2019-07-07 05:09:31,1,1,relationship_advice
649,ca1an1,_babyAcolyte,How much information should I (20/F) tell my new boyfriend (21/M) about how my old relationship ended?,"I was in a year and half long relationship with my ex (23M) that ended back in early March. I had been struggling for a while with that relationship as I felt he did not make any effort to understand me or listen to my worries about our relationship. Specifically, he gave me horrible advice to deal with my depression causing me to shut down in the middle of conversations while he rattled on. As well, when I mentioned how I felt insecure in the relationship as I have plans to move away to graduate school and he was greatly opposed to that, his only response was that there's no need to feel insecure.

I am not proud of this next part, but I reconnected with an old flame (21M) in December who by talking to and spending a lot of time with, while simultaneously rekindling those old feelings, helped me realize how my current relationship was going so poorly.

I broke up with my ex over text the day my dog died in March due to the extreme stress of the past two months finally tipping me over the edge. However, during the weekend I agreed to meet up with him to talk about my choice and I admitted to feelings with my old flame, which were not physically acted upon. My ex and I had sex one last time on the weekend where he agreed to 'let me go' explore these feelings with this new guy as he was confident I would come back to him. He also made it known that it would be up to me to reach out when I was ready.

Immediately after I left my ex's house that day, I headed over to see my old flame and I gave him oral sex. I think I was so excited to be free that I immediately acted on my chance. During the week, he and I spent many intimate moments together which were quite nice and I thought would last awhile.

However, my ex reached out to me after a week wanting to chat again. I was still hung up I suppose, so I agreed. I don't think I was fully prepared to loose someone who had been in my life so regularly. After a conversation, which my ex said a few mean things, like he has too much self worth to take me back right away as if that was what I wanted, we decided to go on a date. Afterwards, I consented to giving him oral sex in his car. Yet, this is where he assaulted me. 

Throughout our whole relationship, he was very aware that I never wanted to swallow at the end of oral sex. In this moment, I realized he was about to cum, so I tried to pull back, but I felt his hand on top of my head pushing down and I was forced to swallow there. I don't remember feeling anything but shock. My current boyfriend knows about the assault, but not the timeline of events.

The week after was one of the most suicidal I have ever felt, though I am doing much better now. Against better judgment, I saw my ex again the following weekend to read him a list of how much he has hurt me and left me feeling violated. Though his response wasn't anything moving, I let him drive us to my dorm and have sex. The following Monday, I agreed to see a movie with him where afterwards I let him drive us in his truck to a dark parking lot where we had sex. I know I didn't want to, but I still let it happen. Immediately after coming home, I sat in the shower once again feeling violated and used.

The day after, I finally called him and told him I would not see him anymore because I refused to wait around till he changed. He implied I could not talk to my old flame while he was allowed to hook up with whoever he wanted since we had broken up.

Though he's reached out since and tried to talk, I have refused to have sex with him again, likely ever. He is now blocked as well.

Now, my old flame and I continued seeing each other exclusively, with him telling me of his wishes to be in a relationship with me. I needed till the 18th of June to finally agree to be his girlfriend.

I am periodically filled with guilt for the two or so weeks I was intimate with both guys. Neither of them know and I am unsure if it is necessary to disclose the timeline details to my new boyfriend.

Though most of the sexual encounters after we were broken up were consensual, I know I still felt pressured to give in, as I had throughout the relationship. But because they were consensual, I feel like I am at fault too. The difficult part is that my boyfriend's friend slept with another woman at the start of his relationship, which his current girlfriend hasn't gotten over. I am not sure if this situation is comparable. Advice is always appreciated.",2019-07-07 01:22:46,1,2,relationship_advice
650,ca39n0,Superfly724,Coping with the end of a relationship,"I (25M) ended an 8 1/2 year relationship back in mid-April but we continued living together until our lease was up on July 3rd. That whole situation was rough, but on the normal days things weren't much different than they were when we were together so it was kind of easy. I ended things because she was emotionally and verbally abusive, along with being manipulative and pretty controlling. It lasted way longer than it should have, but we got invested into the relationship when we were really young and the deeper into the relationship we got the more entwined our lives became and the harder it was to end it.

I met her when I was 17 and freshly out of high school with no car and no job, so being single as an adult is something completely foreign to me. Even though it was my choice to end it, and all I wanted was to be away from her at that point, I can't help but feel lonely now. I've tried talking to some other girls over the last few weeks, but I either don't get past the 3rd message before they stop responding, or it's very clear that they're not actually interested and are just humoring me because they're nice people. I'm not really looking for a relationship, but I want to spend time with women to have new experiences and find out what it is I'm really looking for. 

When I broke up with my ex I was brimming with confidence. I feel like I'm a fairly attractive guy, maybe a 6.5 or a 7 out of 10, and I've been exercising and doing some light workouts to try and stay toned which increased my confidence as well, but all my confidence in the world vanished in a week and I was dragged back down to reality that being single is not going to be as easy as I thought it was. I thought I was completely comfortable being alone, and I begged and pleaded for alone time when I was with my ex, but now that I'm alone all the time I kind if miss the companionship. I don't miss the name calling, or the constant fights, or being told I'm a piece of shit for not reacting to something properly, but the loneliness becomes much more apparent when  you can't get another human to carry on a conversation with you.

I'm trying to make plans with old friends, to keep myself busy, but I can't fill every day with that and I end up alone with my thoughts a lot. I've tried Tinder but I haven't gotten any matches yet. I'm really not the kind of guy to sleep around, so maybe I'm being too picky with my selection cause I skip most of the girls that seem to be just advertising their bodies, but I'm not trying to get in over my head here. I've tried reconnecting with girls I went to school with but that just hurts worse because I'm getting ignored by people I know personally.

I don't think I'm that weird. I'm not pushy, I don't keep texting if they don't respond. I don't blame girls for not wanting to talk to me or anything. I try to ask questions and be interested in what they're saying and I don't bring up my problems or whine to them, but still it seems like I can't get anyone to talk to me.

What have you guys done to cope in this situation? What made things easier? Did meeting new people help, or is it better to solely focus on yourself for a while?",2019-07-07 05:07:48,1,1,relationship_advice
651,ca384t,[deleted],I (22M) feel I should leave long term partner (22F) due to feelings for another person (21F),"I'm not sure I (22M) love my current long term partner (22F) of almost 6 years as much as I thought. Everything should be fine. We get along fine, sex life is good, we underrstsnd each other... but after finally meeting my long distance best friend of 10 years (21F), it's really thrown everything I know on it's head.

Me and my best friend (who we will call Sue) have always had a bit of a thing from back when I was in high school, however we both kind of agreed to leave it be as we just couldn't handle the distance of the relationship. However meeting her again brought back these feeling all at once and it honestly felt like meeting my current partner  all over again. I'm not sure if it's love, or just that I care about her tonnes and it was over whelming seeing her, however it still made me have a long hard think about our relationship.

In the time since I've experienced these emotions from meeting Sue, I feel they are slowly and slowly becoming more permanent. Each time I talk to my current girlfriend, I feel shittier, and I honestly feel that we should end our relationship as she doesn't deserve this type of treatment from me. I don't want to say I love her as idk if I really do anymore. 

I cant continue to date her knowing I feel so strongly for someone else, as it would be cheating emotionally and simply lying to her/abusing her trust. However it would absolutely destroy her and everything in both our lives, as she relies on me so heavily that I'm not sure how she would cope. She needs me for lifts, shopping trips, cooking, printer, basically everything. Plus her biggest fear is me leaving her for another woman, and of course if I say anything about Sue and my feelings, she's going to have a full blown mental breakdown which will be difficult to work through.

We live together. We sleep together. She doesn't have a car so we drive places together. It isn't the type of relationship where I can just say ""we are done"" and then suddenly go no-contact to let her work through the pain herself.

My girlfriend is amazing. I do care about her so much, but I just can't ignore my feelings for Sue and honestly, if I do try to ignore them I'm simply going to be causing more harm than good to her. I am just unsure of how to end things.
I'm not sure how to go about the process and could use as much help as possible, or just suggestions.",2019-07-07 05:02:39,5,1,relationship_advice

653,ca18gb,lotso_huggin_bear,Lost all of my best friends after 20 awesome years... Over something stupid. 36m,"We not totally stupid. I met my best friend 9
(we'll call him Joe) 20 years ago in college, and through him, became friends with his cousin and brothers. One of the brothers (Frank) and I became real close in recent years because of common interests and because my best friend got married was busy building a nest. Fast forward to last year, Frank decided that it was time I met his friends, they were 5 to 7 younger than me but we hit it off real well and even Joe would hang out with us from time to time. We did everything together, hung out, traveled, movies...etc.

Things were chill until December 2018. Some the new friends were very cool and started calling me to hang out and stuff, because we live in the same area while Frank and Joe lived 40 mins away. I never arranged these outings, I'd just accept the invitation.

After a while I noticed Frank was getting a bit distant. We used to hang out 3 to 4 times a week, but he stopped calling all of the sudden. And when we met, he'd barely even talk to me. I asked him straight up if I did something wrong and he just brushed it off as nothing. I asked his brother to talk to him and he got the same answer. Then small annoying things started to happen, like they'd all hang out and not tell me or go see a movie and not even bother calling me (we had seen every single MCU movie together) so when I found out from Joe that they went to see the new Avengers movie I flipped! Then Joe told me it was Frank's decision not to invite me! And that he's been upset and felt betrayed that I was hanging out with his friends! I felt absolutely shocked and horrified that this was even a thing! Guys getting jealous of other guys hanging out with their friends! We're in our effing 30s! I got so upset that I decided not to call any of those people including Joe because he talks about daily life and activities they do together as if nothing had happened! Frank never confronted me and told me to my face wht his problem was.

I just feel like I'm all alone and that I've wasted so much time on people that don't give a shit.",2019-07-07 01:16:09,4,2,relationship_advice

655,ca36f8,ironmanfryingpan,I’m in love with my close friend and I’ve decided I’m going to tell her,"Sorry in advance for the long read.


I’ve know known her since freshman year of high school (4 years ago) and we still talk to this day. I started liking her a couple weeks after meeting her and my feelings have just been getting stronger ever since. To the day I die, I will regret not having the balls to tell her how I felt about her back then. 

She’s perfect in my eyes in every way. I fell in love with her attitude, how chill she is, how open she is, how helpful and strong she is. I never want our conversations to end and just looking at her puts butterflies in my stomach and my heart beat faster. I’ve never met anyone like her. I’d give up the world and then some just for her. But I don’t think she feels the same way towards me. 

She had her eyes set on this one guy in my school known for just fucking and moving on but nothing came of it. Finding this out hit me like a truck but I stuck by her side because I thought being her friend at the very least is good enough for me. 

She left my school halfway through sophomore year and it devastated me. I couldn’t even tell her how I felt on her last day at the school. All I could do was give her a necklace I bought the day before for her and hug her goodbye. I started talking to her best friend at the time only because I thought i lost the love of my life. I started going out with her best friend shortly after and things were going smooth, until she texted me out of no where and asked if I wanted to go to her birthday party. I said yes immediately and went and had the time of my life. The dress she wore had me breathless. I remember that day like it was yesterday. A couple of her friends were there but I only focused on her. 

After the party, her best friend was mad at me that she wasn’t invited and that I went. She’d hold that against me and start talking shit about the girl I really loved up until I ended things at the beginning of senior year. This was also around the time I found out that my close friend had gotten a boyfriend. That news hurt me more than any other news I’ve received in a couple years. But since I was single again and could hang out with her now without any repercussion, I hit her up and asked if she wanted to hang out some time (I grew balls in those couple years without her in my life). 

She told me about one of our friends birthday party and that I could go to it and how she’ll be there so I decided to go. At the party, since this was the first time I’ve seen her in 2 years, seeing her had me frozen. I could only think about my feelings towards her and how they were one sided. 

I needed to get my mind off it so I started talking to one of the girls I met at the party. My close friend was actually trying to push us together and I didn’t know how to feel about that. The girl I started talking to got a lot of my attention that day and 2 weeks later, I asked her out. We started dating but then she changed. The problems that comes up with any relationship would be handled very poorly by her. She would be really disrespectful towards me and threaten to leave me if I don’t change the way I do things. I ended things a day before our 2 month anniversary. One thing I liked about going out with her though is that I got to see my close friend a lot more as long as she was there with me.

It’s been 3 weeks since all that has happened and I don’t know how much longer I can go with feeling this way. I don’t want to wait for my close friend to get out of her relationship because who knows when that’ll happen and I don’t want waste my time but then I see her and forget everything I just said. But from what I’ve seen, they fight a lot but seem to make up fast which could either be a good or bad thing. I also found out from my close friend that the boyfriend gets mad whenever she hangs out with me or anyone of her dude friends despite her knowing them longer than she’s known him. It’s clear as day how insecure the guy is. She can’t even hug her friends hello or goodbye or that would be another fight in the relationship. Obviously you can’t do certain things while in a relationship but she can’t do a lot of things I think she should be able to do. She basically has to give up seeing us as much as she wants to for the boyfriend to be happy. I honestly don’t think they should be together, even if a part of me is just saying that because I want to be with her. 

To try to get over her is way easier said than done as whenever we’re together, she is very touchy and sometimes our conversations suggest she’s flirting but I don’t know and I doubt it. She is loyal after all. And I can’t help but be reminded of her relationship every time I think about me being in one with her since I’ve seen her and her boyfriend doing things couples do normally but it just messes with me. 

Something happened recently though. A couple days ago my friend walked in on my close friend and her boyfriend and as soon as he entered, the boyfriend got off from his knees. The next day, my close friend tells my friend that her boyfriend proposed to her and she showed him the ring. He’s not sure weather she was joking or not. 

I was speechless hearing this. We’re both 18 so getting married right now is crazy to me. They have been going out for maybe a year and a half but I don’t thinks that’s enough time to propose to someone. 

I just don’t know what to do with my feelings. No one should have to hide their feelings but I’m afraid if I tell her I’m getting nothing in return and possibly losing her. That would be a nightmare to me because being her friend at the very least is good enough for me.

But I’ve decided, after I got some really good advice from my last post (which is very similar to this but not the same), that I’m going to tell her how I feel no matter what happens after. I just don’t know when I should do it and what exactly I should say to her. 

Here’s what I have planned so far: in the next couple times I see her, maybe 3 times from today, I will show her our first conversations which is funny and cringy. Then I’ll ask her, based on how we texted, if she liked me back then or am I delusional. Whatever her response is, I’ll just get lost in her eyes on purpose then ask if I can talk to her privately. There I’ll tell her everything. What I think of her basically toxic relationship, some of the stuff I told ya about and whatever comes from my heart at the moment. Finally, I’ll tell her “i don’t remotely think you feel the same way I do towards me but that’s ok. I just really needed to get all that off my chest or else I don’t know what I’d do”. I’ll probably go home right after and lastly tell her “I understand if you don’t want to talk to me after today. Just know Ive treasured every second I got to spend with you. Take care.”

656,ca6xnv,indyannaj0nes,Should I stay or should I go,"I need advice! Should I leave my husband or should I try really hard to fall back in love with him. Last year in March I told my husband I was sooo depressed and unhappy. I said I needed help, I would just sleep all day, letting out two girls just run a muck in our house. I asked him to take a more active role in our household. I told him it feels like you don’t care about me or our family, like he’s just a ghost in our family, always hanging in the sidelines and behind me not beside me. He only did stuff that needed done when prompted and never took initiative. He never asked if our bills were paid or if the kids should go to the doctor or what extra activities should they be doing. Just didn’t care 🤷‍♀️ I just handled everything. After telling him how unhappy I was he changed or did nothing. He seemed concerned but didn’t know how to help me, so he didn’t try. So I took things into my own hands and started working out, eating healthy, getting b12 shots, massages, me time. I felt great! I lost 30 pounds, and I looked pretty cute to myself lol 🙈 But I still felt empty inside and unfulfilled. But I did notice how nice it felt to be noticed by men, since working out and being confident made me noticeably more attractive now. I especially liked the attention of a friend at work, Robbie. He was very good looking and a fun goof ball of a guy. He liked big butts too, which I had 🍑🍑🍑. I wanted to fuck him silly, I’m a very sexual minded dirty girl. I love to get fucked a lot lol. Like a princess in the streets but a freak in the sheets 😉. Soooooo, naturally I asked my husband if we could try swinging or an open marriage. So I could fuck Robbie without fucking up my ok marriage 👌🤦‍♀️ It took some convincing from me to my husband that I still loved him sooo much and this isn’t a bad thing yada yada yada ( I’m full of shit, I was emotionally unattached to my hubs already at this point) So the dumbass agrees to me fucking who ever I wanted. Of course he got to as well. But alas he’s a nerd and has no game 😂 So we sign up for a swinger website to start our strange sex adventures. We chat around a little on the site, and get really horny for each other and fuck a lot lol 😉 Then we start talking to a guy from California who wanted us to send him vids and pics of us gettin busy 😳😳😳 We make a super hot vid of me deep throating my hubs and the guy goes nuts and says we’re so hot together and we should do porn. We felt great 😬😬😬👌 the thrill was exhilarating! I WANTED MORE!!!! I quickly brought up me going to fuck a man solo by myself. He agreed and I went to the swinger website to hunt for my next fuck. Mind you, me and my hubs are 10 years apart in age. He was 27 and I was 17 when we lost our virginity’s to each other. I was excited to experience different dick lol 🙈🤤 I found my guy quickly, Ivory, a super cut good looking engineer who lived in the city over from me. He was gracious and kind in our messages to each other and he seemed legit ☺️☺️☺️ The night I went to get the living shit fucked out of me by Ivory my husband didn’t sleep a wink. As soon as I arrived home freshly fucked my hubs couldn’t keep his hands off me! He thought it was soo hot that I was essentially a hotwife and a milf to boot. I was his personal porn star essentially. He wanted to see me get fucked by another dude now. I agreed if under the right circumstances. We made a plan to go out on the town and we try to get fucked, either as a threesome, or if one of us gets lucky separately we part ways and meet up after. I’m looking super hot, like Zoe in New girl meets Pamela Anderson 😜 I also recently downloaded tinder 😂👌 We’re at a super cool arcade bar, it’s packed.

657,ca3648,anotherthrowaway489,"I [18/M] broke up with my SO [18/F] recently, I don't know what to do now","18 year old guy here, using a throwaway for obvious reasons 

Broke up with my girlfriend of 5 months two days ago, we were really good friends prior to that and opened up to each other about some of our personal stuff. She opened up about her family situation, and I opened up about my severe anxiety.

Her family situation is beyond horrible. Her parents are abusive and have physically and psychologically abused her in a plethora of different away. They've beaten her for talking back, called her a whore for dozens of different reasons (all complete bs), they don't allow her to go outside of their house or hang out with friends, they don't allow her to talk to guys, they've tried on numerous occasions to prevent her from becoming more independent by trying to stop her from doing her driving test, preventing her from applying to get jobs, and saying that if she doesn't get into the university that they want her to get into they're either moving to a different city or the worst thing, they're getting her married. I'll skip the specific instances of physical abuse and mental abuse mostly because as I type this I'm barely keeping it together.

Now I and her friends advised her several times that her situation is beyond fucked and she needs to leave for her own survival before something more awful happens. She doesn't want to leave her parents, she thinks she deserves this shitty situation, which is complete BS because she's easily one of the most genuine, caring, and just good people I've ever met. A few weeks ago she told me that she'd ""rather die than leave her parents""

Like a couple of weeks ago I had started talking more to one of her friends and opened up to them about me and my girlfriend's tenuous situation. I told the friend that I love my girlfriend so very much and that I don't want to leave, and that I can't give up on her. I told the situation to one of my friends who along with the other friend basically drilled into my head that this wasn't my fault, that my girlfriend wasn't my responsibility and I have to accept her choice and I can't force her to do what I think is right no matter how shitty it might be. While that's all correct and I am close to fully convincing myself that it's true before I broke up with her I was so conflicted and I didn't know what to do. My girlfriend's home situation had gotten to me intensely, and I basically shared some degree of her stress and anguish. Not healthy at all especially for what was an amazing relationship built on trust, caring, complete honesty, and all that. I guess I couldn't take it anymore. For the last few days, She and I had been talking non stop about this, about how she wasn't going to leave, and about how it was hurting me severely now. My friends knew I wouldn't be able to stop myself from caring that much about her and being that invested in her situation, so they told me that for my own sanity and mental well-being that I needed to end things with her at least for now so I could take care of myself.

Two days ago me and her were talking, she told me that she'd talked to her friends and they basically told her the same thing that mine told me. That if she isn't going to leave, that she should end things with me before one of us breaks or both of us. She couldn't bring herself to do it, so I did it, I ended my relationship with her. Neither of us wanted this to happen, we're both still madly in love with each other and not even slightly ready to move on. Today she tried to convince me to stay with her, and I told her that I couldn't do that because I needed to heal and take care of myself first (no matter how selfish I feel for that). 

I feel like complete shit, and we're still talking even though ""officially"" our relationship is done, she still said she loves me right before we stopped talking for the day a few hours ago, and like an idiot I said it back. All my friends have said I made the right choice, but I can't help but feel I've made a huge mistake. I still am madly in love with her, and I don't know what to do now.

He blames it on being tired or he doesn’t feel close enough to me but he’ll try more, and says it has nothing to do with me and sex is just a lot of physical work. But we’re young! We should have the energy to do these things. 

And I’m human so I’ve asked him if he’s asexual (no), if there’s someone else (no), if he’s not attracted to me anymore (no), if he’s not in love with me anymore (no). Now he’s saying he “might have depression”  but I have depression and still want to have sex, I get everyone’s different but.. idk. We can go 1 week-1month without having sex and we LIVE together, I feel like I’m at my end, we aren’t having sex or engaged, he’s barely romantic and I feel like I’m at my wits end here, but I love him, supposedly he’s in love with me too, and I’ve been best friends with him since I was 13, we’re each other’s first for everything but kissing. 

I don’t want to end it here for fear of being alone and never finding anyone as sweet and patient as him, but sometimes I think it’s better to be single and live my life.. Am I wasting my time? Or is there something we can do? Because “communicating my feelings to him” doesn’t work.",2019-07-07 04:52:47,14,1,relationship_advice
660,ca156p,keanuroberto2,Why can’t I let go of her,"She was truly awful to me. Like truly truly awful. She led me on. She told me about all the other guys she slept with, in detail sometimes, while we were in bed together. She had no respect for me. She made me feel like a total piece of shit even though I was trying so hard with her.

I just now found out that the guy she had been telling me about that she slept with a few months before, was the same fucking guy she kept liking all the photos of during our relationship. Something I made a real effort to not get jealous over. It’s also the same guy who she ‘went for drinks with’ while I was seeing her. 

I’m physically shaking right now. I’m so angry. But she doesn’t give 2 fucks. She ghosted me and never spoke to me again. But she still goes through all my Instagram stuff. 

Why the hell do I still long for her. I miss her every day but I hate her guts. I can’t even bring myself to block her on Instagram. 

Any advice? It’s killing me",2019-07-07 01:06:33,4,2,relationship_advice
661,c9zsw0,OublieQuest,Can I (29F) even fix this relationship with boyfriend (29M) that I destroyed?,"A few days ago I destroyed my relationship and I regret it. My boyfriend and I had been together for just short of three years. And though it had been a rocky start, I pursued him so hard. Maybe I should have known better. He gave me lots of mixed signals early on. He had a favorite person that was an ex. He was a notorious flirt. He floated the idea of me moving in early on and then he started to flake on that when my lease was up at my place. Yet I kept pursuing, pursuing, pursuing. And we were able to work out most things. He chilled on the flirting, I moved in. For a golden period of time we were so good.

&amp;#x200B;

About a year and a half ago we started talking about getting married. I was certain that he was ""the one"" and I am the kind of person that would scoff at such a concept. But this is the first and only guy I have ever considered marrying and I was actually excited about it. He seemed to be on board... until we ran into what I see as the catalyst of our unsolvable problems. This being that I wanted to elope and he wanted to have a huge ordeal of a wedding.

&amp;#x200B;

We went to counseling. He barely made an effort. And by the end of it when I was going alone I had to make a decision on what I wanted. The decision that I made was that I was going to wait one year to see if things got better and if he would propose. He knew I had a timeline he just didn't know when the end was.

&amp;#x200B;

We had other problems as well. He is christian and I am atheist, he dislikes how much I hate certain groups of people (namely christians and conservatives). To clarify I don't hate individual christians...just the groups of them that tell me what to do with my own damn body. We agreed however on what I saw as the important things. We are both liberal, both pro-choice, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So, three days ago after he got offended by a quote I posted on our kitchen message board he said we were diametrically opposed, I said if you haven't figured out if you want to marry me by now then I am walking in a few months. There was further conversation about our differences.

&amp;#x200B;

That isn't how it ended completely though. I spent the next few days begging him to let us try again. That we know what our differences are and we can work on them. I can be less abrasive and more considerate and he could be less sensitive and more empathetic to me.

&amp;#x200B;

But the one other thing we have in common is how stubborn we are. He won't budge. All I really ever wanted from him was for him to want me back, and make that commitment. I think I threw all of myself into this relationship, good and bad parts. I love him and all of his flaws. I know I am not a perfect person and that this post makes him out to be worse that he really is. Believe me, I know I am a shitty person. There are many more sides to this story but that would take too long to write.

&amp;#x200B;

I told him I wasn't going to give up on this relationship. Not unless he told me he was giving up on me. He didn't want to say it, I know because he didn't want to hurt me further, but he eventually did.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have boxes stacked in the dining room with my things. I don't know where I am going. I will be staying here with him for a little while longer. I guess in general I just don't know what to do. It just sucks. I want to fix this but I don't think he wants to. I don't want to give up but I know I should.

TL;DR - I broke up with my boyfriend because he doesn’t know if he wants to marry me yet. Instantly regretted it and wanted work on things. He doesn’t seem to want to.

662,ca34b1,hootanannyhoedown,I'm [28/m] I cheated on [30/f]and was forgiven but I'm over it.,Over the past 4 years. My girlfriend has gained a significant amount of weight. She is always complaining of pcos symptoms. But refuses to do anything about it. Part of that is she has alot of facial hair she keeps it shaved but it bothers her and she always complains about it. I have always tried my best to totally ignore that part about her and I have always been fine but. That combined with a 50+ pound weight gain and sexual issues are becoming alot for me to ignore. Let me tell you about the sexual issues. The untreated pcos makes her only have a period once every 2 or 3 months. AND we have sex so infrequently that when we do. She starts her period right afterwords. She says her starting it has nothing to do with me and it's just the time for it to start. Then we don't have any sex until it's over. The other sexual problem is. Oral sex. She goes down on me and ends up getting these sores in her mouth because she is sensitive to bacteria or something so if she had those oral sex is not happening. And guess when she has them? All the time.  When does she get them? Only after it's been so long I'm not even interested and then she tries to do it to make me happy and I don't even want her to touch my dick at all because it will start her period or hurt her mouth or something. I'm also going to mention she has seen a doctor and been tested about the sores. Doctor says just sensitive to bacteria. I don't think I'm gonna be able to pull myself out of this and find her attractive again. There is alot of damage done here and I really want things to work out but she has not worked on herself at all and it's  been too long for me to wait around and be supportive anymore.,2019-07-07 04:49:07,3,0,relationship_advice
663,ca33sa,awkwahd,Did I (22M) ruin things with this girl (21F)???,"I was seeing this girl for a month, her name is Victoria just imagine how hot she is, even her name is hot. She’s like a 10/10, curly brown hair, hazel eyes. Small cute ass. Fuck. And she is so witty and sarcastic. We went out a couple times and she came over tonight finally and we fucked for the first time.

I was nervous. But the beginning was good. We made out and she was a great kisser and I went down on her and she was 100% clean and trimmed, fuck yeah, and she came twice. For real too, she wasn’t faking it I could tell. And she gave me head before we fucked because she’s perfect and we were fucking and I knew I was gonna bust quick, we had a lot of foreplay and I was like 99% there. So I told her I’m gonna cum and she starts talking dirty and it made me go a bit crazy and went I came, I just went “hiyAAAA!!” Like I was doing karate or some shit. But in a weird moaning choking way. I don’t know what the fuck I was thinking. She looked at me. It was fine, she gave me a kiss and cleaned us up and I thought we were ok. Nope

I asked her to cuddle and stay the night and I’d make her a sandwich if she got hungry. She left right afterwards and said she had to be somewhere in the morning. I even offered to drive her home and she said she was fine taking the subway and I texted her a while after asking her if she got on yet and she said “yeah” that’s it. No ❤️ or ☺️ or “I had a great time with you”. 

Did I fuck things up??? Is it over. How do I fix it. She is really amazing. Should I make a joke about the hiyaaa",2019-07-07 04:47:26,2,1,relationship_advice
664,c9zs76,AnonButchPOS-,I [25F] abused my girlfriend [21F] while black out drunk.,"I had a difficult week emotionally about two weeks ago. I don’t want to go into the details about why but I was in a very low place and suicidal, hurt and angry. So to cope I went to my gfs house and started pounding Jell-O shots. I don’t remember anything for most of the night, including getting up off the couch to go upstairs.  


The next morning my gf got out of bed early and went downstairs to study for an upcoming test. She told me that we had had sex the night before and that I had choked her well. We usually engage in light bondage and spanking/ slapping/ spitting. She is strictly a sub and I am strictly a top. This is only the second relationship with a woman that I’ve been in, but I have been physically abusive in relationships with men. It was stuff like slapping them too hard on the arm and they didn’t like it. I have definitely dealt with anger issues and mental illness for most of my life. So now I’m dating this petite girl who is into being dommed. I’m larger and I work out often. 


A couple of days after the incident she told me that it was not consensual. I was being rough and hurting her and she wanted me to stop and I didn’t respect that. I don’t know all of the details but I know I scared her and hurt her. She wound up with bruises on her ass from me biting her, and she is newly terrified of being choked. She’s also now dealing with social anxiety and anxiety in bed. Obviously she trusted me and I violated her trust. 


Of course I feel like fucking human garbage. I have no idea where this came from or that I was even capable of this kind of violence especially against someone essentially helpless. I went to my therapist and we formulated a drinking plan of 3 drinks per day 3 days a week. I joined Narcotics Anon and she has scheduled an appointment with a therapist for this Monday. 

I’ve apologized. We’ve held each other and cried. I’ve never been in a physical fight or on the receiving end of serious physical violence. I literally was in shock that I was capable of this kind of monstrosity. I feel horrible and have been asking what I can do to make amends. That I understand if she were to go to the police or her family or anyone. She cares about me and “doesn’t want to get me into trouble” or stop talking to me. She doesn’t have anyone to talk to about it even though I’ve told her she is welcome to tell whoever she wants to and that I can accept any consequences to my actions. She is afraid of losing her relationship with me forever and can’t confide in her family as they would (UNDERSTANDABLY) want to go to the police to press charges. 

She has been experiencing social anxiety when going out in crowds. She has new triggers in bed that we discussed so I can avoid triggering her new trauma. What can I do to make things right? As I mentioned before she doesn’t want to stop dating me; but I would understand if she did or if she came to that conclusion down the road.  

Please no homophobic remarks. If violence in a lesbian relationship upsets you more than the violence committed every day in heterosexual relationships, you need to re-evaluate your priorities. I am looking for advice for someone who has been in this situation. I will do everything I can to make things right. I have an NA meeting tonight if I don’t respond. 

I know I am human garbage and I agree. I am so sorry. This is the worst thing I have ever done and I would give anything to take it back. But I can’t. So what can I possibly do to work towards repair.",2019-07-06 22:49:26,33,3,relationship_advice

666,ca32vf,ImpossibleWay4,Should I talk to him or not?,"So this past year I broke up with a guy I had been dating for a year and a half. The primary reason was that I didn't think I'm what he wanted (yes, I'll admit, I deal with self-esteem issues).. Sometimes he wouldn't keep his word about coming to visit me, but usually he had pretty good excuses when he couldn't (we live 30 miles apart and he has some family issues). He's also very close to his family which has serious issues, like his mom's depression and his dad's alcoholism. I always felt like he's prioritized them way above me. 

Other than that, though, our relationship had been great. We enjoyed the time we spent with one another. Anyway, he was pretty devastated by the breakup. Since then, he has been sending me stuff from his trips overseas (he travels a lot for work). This breakup was nothing like any other I've been through -- this one was painful, whereas the other breakups I've had were pretty easy. I've cried myself to sleep more nights than not. More recently, he sent me a (very expensive) sweet gift for my birthday that I had said I wanted but couldn't afford. He's said that he is willing to give me more priority and cut some strings with his family. But I'm afraid of him going back to his old ways and I don't know if I could handle that again.

Should I give him a second chance? Or is he just trying to buy my affection and put on a front?",2019-07-07 04:44:20,3,1,relationship_advice
667,ca32n8,throwaway595030392,My (20M) boyfriend (26M) is pressured by my social media usage,"Hello,

Me and my boyfriend are managing an LDR. We are together for 2 months now. We met a few times but other than that we sometimes voice chat and most of the times text.

He recently started a new job, which has been stressful in its own right, and he says that he feels constant pressure if he does not reply to my texts in time. My work is in the tech industry, so I can usually spare more time for texting, hence the difference.

In addition, he says that I overuse ""I love you"" to that point where he feels that if he does not return it I would feel like he does not love me as much. Worth saying that he is my first ever relationship and I am overflowing with emotions, and I tend to just share them. So yeah, I love you comes a lot from me.

Thing is, I can understand both his points. Sometimes when I'm working and he's off work I can feel the same kind of stress to reply. I usually refer to it as ""love stress"" (kinda like having ""Work stress"", ""financial stress"" etc), but I usually brush it off because I want this relationship and I feel like this is another thing I have to deal with when managing an LDR. While I am okay with that, I can respect the fact that he cannot deal with it as good.

We have had a few arguments surrounding it. He always apologised and says that it's his fault for not managing his stress. I really have ZERO need/want to cause him any stress. It just happens.

I have actively tried to adjust my social media exposure in general, and specifically I know not to text him at work if he's not texting me. We had a big fight yesterday and it came up again, and I told him I was actively trying to reduce it and he kind of dismissed me. I know he's going through some mental struggles too, so he's generally more agitated and irritable. I would like to be as supportive and understanding as possible.

What's the best play here? How far should I tone it down? What do I do so that my relationship does not crumble because of a bad habit? (and I do acknowledge it as one)",2019-07-07 04:43:35,0,0,relationship_advice
668,ca32lc,qwertyasdfmnbv,My (24m) gf (22f) has been very upset lately and I can’t think of how to help.,"A little backstory. This may be a little long (and probably confusing), I tend to get lost in my writing. TL;DR at the bottom.


I’ve been with my gf for a year and a half now, she was my best friend for around 3 months before then and still is. 

When we first met she just had one best friend who she did everything with. 
I had a decent sized friend group and slowly integrated her into it. Her friend became very busy between work and school and wasn’t around much anymore, but she was hanging out with my group now so she didn’t mind too much.

We got closer and closer, started hanging out alone and texting all the time. Not romantically yet. Her friend got a boyfriend and was pretty much out of her life by this point.

A couple months later we started dating. We fell into the local music scene and got real wrapped up in that, big parties at least once a week.

That went on for quite a few months, and we were getting a bit out of hand with our drinking. (We knew enough to keep our hands off all the drugs floating around, luckily.)

Fast forward through all that to January of this year. I decided to go back to school and finish the last few semesters I dropped out on. We cut back quite a bit on our drinking and partying and convinced each other to get back to the gym. She decided to stop drinking entirely since she was really feeling awful after drinking.

We were still hanging out with all our friends, she just wouldn’t drink any alcohol. She noticed that people were slowly talking to her less and less in person and wouldn’t text her as much. I didn’t really notice until she pointed it out.

Now she’s convinced that none of our friends want to bother with her anymore since she doesn’t drink. Another one of our friends who went sober agrees that they feel like they’ve been excommunicated by the group.

They all still text me regularly and when my GF can’t hang out I’ll still hang out with them.

No ones outright mean to her, and I’m still not totally convinced anyone’s avoiding her because she won’t drink. But she’s been super upset about this for the past few weeks. 

For the most part, it’s just been me and her hanging out alone and going on a lot of dates—which I absolutely love. But I do miss going to parties every now and then, or sitting around a fire with some people. When I do hang out with our friends she never wants to come. Of course I would never choose them over her, so I’ve been declining a bunch of invites lately. (No one ever tells me not to bring her, but they are all friends we made together and both of us used to get texted separately.)

I don’t think any of our friends are purposely excluding her, the majority of them are genuinely good people. She’s pretty shy and reserved when she’s sober and the complete opposite drunk, so she’s thinking that no one finds her fun when she’s sober.

I don’t want to stop hanging out with all of our friends, but she’s really not comfortable hanging out with any of them anymore. I would never tell her she has to go home so I could go to a party, plus I wouldn’t have much fun without her there anyway. She knows this and it makes her feel even worse. She’s constantly volunteering to go home so I could go have fun. I reassure her that going for a walk with her is still 10x more fun than going to a party but she still feels terrible and guilty. (I really would much rather hang out just the two of us most nights, I’m not lying to her to cheer her up.)


TL;DR: Me and my GF are part of a massive friend group of heavy drinkers. She cut out drinking and now feels that no one wants to bother with her anymore. I hate seeing her upset all the time but have no idea how to help her. 


I’m not even really sure what the question I’m asking is, but does anyone have any advice?

If you need anything clarified let me know, I’m not the best at organizing my thoughts.

669,ca31kv,snipscoop,I (21 F) am not always physically attracted to my boyfriend (22 M),"We have been dating for almost 5 years. The relationship has been on and off, but officially on for the past 3 years. When we first began dating, I struggled with my feelings for him because he treats me right and is my best friend, but I wasn’t physically/ sexually attracted to him. As the relationship grew, the physical attraction and sexual attraction developed but has never really been 100% consistent. We connect really well sexually even though I tend to lack a libido. My main concern I guess is that I love him, our relationship is great, he is my best friend, he knows how to please me, but I often don’t find him physically attractive. Is this normal? Can anyone relate? Please help

Edit: there are times when I think he is the hottest/ cutest/ sexiest guy, but more often than not I think he’s not very cute. The beginning of our relationship a lot of people (friends and acquaintances) would tell me how I “could do better” and how “not cute” he is. I know this contributed to my overall feelings no matter how hard I tried to shake It off.

670,c9m1wb,shhwiajd-dis,Not allowed a plus one to my best friend’s wedding because it might cause a scene...,"One of my close friends, Ana, has just announced her engagement - and I’m absolutely thrilled for her. She asked me to a bridesmaid and so far I’ve been really involved in planning the wedding.

There is one slight point of contention between me and my friend - my ex-partner, Will. Will and I were together for 8 years. In my view, he was extremely abusive emotionally and was also physically abusive to me once and very physically intimidating to me otherwise. 

Will and Ana are also friends. During my relationship with Will I kept quiet about all the abusive behaviour because I was embarrassed. After we broke up, I told Ana about everything and she expressed that she felt awful she had not known and if she had she would have been there for me. Despite this, she maintained a friendship with Will and made it clear she would not be “taking sides”. 

It’s now two and a half years later and I’ve started seeing someone else. Will started seeing someone else shortly after we broke up, but has made it clear to Ana that he is still not over me. 

Ana has invited Will to the wedding, together with his new partner, but has asked me not to bring anyone as Will might “cause a scene”. 

I feel extremely uncomfortable about this. Firstly, I feel I want someone there to support me if I have to see my ex. Secondly, I think that if she is concerned about Will making a scene, it should be him that isn’t invited, not my plus one. Finally, although she says she isn’t taking sides, I feel like this is exactly what she’s doing when she considers how he would feel about me bringing someone and not how I would feel...

I’m reluctant to talk to her about my feelings of anxiety towards Will because she has already dismissed them once. Am I being unreasonable in the way I’m looking at this? Is there something I’m missing that could justify her stance? I don’t want to make a fuss and say I’m not going to go to the wedding, but I’m seriously viewing it with a lot of anxiety now knowing my ex will be there and I will be alone. Any advice would be really appreciated.  

TLDR; my friend asked me to be a bridesmaid, invited my abusive ex and told me I can’t have a plus one in case he doesn’t like it. What to do?",2019-07-05 22:20:29,113,263,relationship_advice
671,ca0zvx,rufus1985,Is my partner (subconsciously or not) stringing me along when it comes to marriage and kids? And is he being careless with my feelings or am I just overreacting?,"My partner (M32) and I (F34) have been together for 8 years. We have a really loving connected relationship. He is sensitive to my feelings most of the time and is a wonderful person which is why the following is so upsetting and so alarming. 

So lately, because I’m getting older and my ovaries have an expiration date the subject of having a child is coming up. We both have said that we want one in the future for years and now I can see it happening in two years. We’re in a bit of debt so our plan has been to pay off our debt in one year and then save money for the next. When I broached the subject of having a baby at the end of the two years I got a really noncommittal “maybe” because he doesn’t want to have a child unless we are financially stable, have a home, etc. He grew up in a normal sort of nuclear family suburbs kind of way and I grew up with an amazing single mom who took us from living on welfare for the first year of my life to working her way up to earning a really great living while raising me all by herself. Because of his upbringing I think, he can’t fathom getting married or having a kind unless everything is planned and perfect monetarily off the bat. Though I understand where he’s coming from, I’m 34, times ticking and I’d rather have a kid then wait for the “perfect time” and find out I can’t have a kid. So yeah, we talked, he wouldn’t consider the alternative, I said I wasn’t sure I could gamble this, that it’s a part of life I want to experience no matter what and if he can’t commit to a plan and a timeline or even just a solid answer then he needs to tell me now so I can figure out what to do. This is a big big issue obviously. So anyways it was a heart wrenching kind of awful conversation and in the end we just went into separate rooms for the night and in the morning he left for Montreal with his parents and right before he left I told him to really give this some thought while we were apart. 

So today after 2 days of not getting into anything and just texting that we loved each other and missed each other he sends me a video along with a couple other videos of dogs being cute or hilarious or whatever only this one video is a full 5 minutes of dogs reacting to their humans being pregnant or holding their baby or just dogs interacting with the babies they love in a really beautiful cute way. I know him so my first thought wasn’t “oh he changed his mind!”. No, what happened was he just happened upon this “cute baby and dog video” and sent it to me completely ignoring the sensitivity of the situation. I sent a message back saying “that was a bit much considering our last couple days together eh?” And he said “sorry, I thought you’d find it cute.”

So that’s what happened today.

Last week, (Part b of this longgggg story - I’m so sorry!) In a moment of “genius” he said “hey! Babe! I have an idea! Since you have such a hard time remembering to turn off the oven why don’t we do this: every time you forget to turn off the oven, well push back having a kid by 4 months.” To which I replied by immediately breaking into tears and we had it out.

And finally because were here and I may as well get some opinions on this as well since I think it kind of applies to the overall vibe or is and marriage etc.  Last year he’d been really wanting to play this prank at his sisters upcoming wedding since he was mc’ing it. He’d been talking about doing this for 2/3 years before hand and I’d always, always been very vocal about how disrespectful and shitty it would be for me. And 100% not funny. I also said, if you’re sister gets married before us then I’ll be pissed, joking but also not joking. He knew I was ready to get married at that point.  The prank was: while he was doing his Mc speech he would casually walk over to me, get down on one knee, look me in the eyes and then after everyone gasped he would say something like “one second sorry, I just have to tie my shoe” and everyone would erupt in laughter and I would say something like “hahah oh you!” 
So anyways, the week of her wedding came (we still hadn’t gotten married or engaged ourselves) and he asked if he could do it again and I was like “fine, if it’s really that important to your speech....”, the day came, he did it, everyone was shocked but not in a good way and all night I had people coming up to me saying how sorry they were and asking if I knew he was going to do that. It wasn’t great.

So yeah, that’s what’s been going on. In between those awful moments there have been lovely beautiful times with a caring wonderful man but I guess what I’m asking is are those bad moments big giant signs that he doesn’t want to marry me, doesn’t want kids and is happy with everything as it is right now even though when I ask he says that “someday” he does want to do those things with me? Again, it’s been 8 years. 

Thoughts? And also, because when I’ve tried to explain how bad those first two things were to him and he’s basically just said “im so sorry I hurt you but I don’t think it’s that big a deal”, just to get some perspective on those two first situations, that’s pretty shitty right? Like insensitive, and ignorant and hurtful and all those things. Or were those two things okay and I’m just overreacting?

672,ca0zo5,wela_wahine,"Is it a bad sign that my boyfriend doesn’t invite me around when he’s with his kids, even though I’ve already met them? He didn’t include me all weekend knowing I would be alone.","I’m just curious what others think, because it’s likely not a big deal.

We have been together 10 months, both have children from previous marriages. Just recently (the past month), we finally introduced our children to each other and have had two instances when we both had our children the same weekend and set up play dates, and the kids had a great time with each other. 

Since it’s only been a month and we have only seen the kids during the weekends we have them (weekdays too difficult due to work schedule), we have only been around them a few times, so integrated, but still getting acquainted.

My question is, is it odd and/or a bad sign that he does not invite me to spend time with them when he’s with them? It’s just a change in schedule due to the holiday this week where my kids went on vacation with my ex-husband and I saw my boyfriend Wednesday evening through Thursday morning (4th of July). That evening he got his kids and still has them. I haven’t had mine since, due to the vacation. My boyfriend knew I was alone and will be alone this weekend but has not invited me to do anything. I honestly thought nothing of it because having kids of my own, I understand he most likely wants to enjoy his time with them and not have to include anyone else. But my friends brought up the thought that the kids have already met me so why is he still keeping me separate? Of course these friends don’t have kids, but this is nothing to be concerned about, right?",2019-07-07 00:50:34,6,2,relationship_advice

678,ca2ypz,DrugInfo247,Need advice on how to proceed with friendship. Can’t tell if long time best friends want to be friends with me anymore,"I (29F) have two best friends Laura and Mary. We all have been best friends since we were 12 years old. I was in graduate school until I was 25 and worked a lot to pay off student loans, but still saw the girls a few times a year. Still texted a decent amount and things got busy with all of us but I always considered them to be my best friends forever. 

They both are married. I am single. Mary has a baby. Laura is planned to give birth this month. I was texting Laura to see what hospital she would be at and didn’t hear from her so I asked Mary to please keep me in the loop if she hears anything. Mary says that’s her news to share with me and I’m sure she will let you know. I said I understand. I felt like that statement just meant we really aren’t as close as friends as I thought we were. 

I am not on social media, but go on occasionally. I see a post from another mutual friend of ours that Laura has given birth. It’s a picture of Laura, mutual friend, and baby in the hospital. Laura comments on the friends photo so I know she has looked at her phone. I also see Laura has posted pictures of baby on her own instagram. No one has told me and it’s been 2 days. My best friend had a baby and no one told me for 2 days.

The kicker is also I saw on her Instagram that they had an annual girls weekend trip up north. I was uninvited. Last year when they went I asked them why I wasn’t invited and that I was kind of hurt by it because I do want to spend time with them and I miss them and I love them! They said it was planned last minute. This year I was uninvited again. They just started this trip last year so it’s not a long standing annual event.

I congratulated Laura and she’s been texting me a little bit. I just am so confused. I don’t know what I did. I always try to reach out. My birthday was in April and Laura tried to come to dinner but was feeling tired since she was pregnant. Mary came. I don’t know what happened between April and now. Or how to even go about this. I obviously am not going to say anything to a new mom because she has more important things to deal with then an old friend with hurt feelings. 

I guess I just thought these girls were my best friends through and through and it seems like they don’t care to be or consider me theirs. I am the type of person who has a handful of friends/relatives who I see less than once a year, but are still great friends and pick up where we left off. This is just throwing me off and I feel sad about it. Any advice is appreciated.",2019-07-07 04:29:54,2,1,relationship_advice

We've talked about marriage and having a family, but I don't want to have children and he does. Although my SO is not pressuring me, he thinks he's going to change my mind.

For additional context: I've lived a sheltered life for 23 years. I was never allowed to be independent. Now that I recently graduated from nursing school, I'm ready to find a job, save a bit of money to buy a car, and find a place of my own. I'm ready to live the life I've always wanted. But I honestly don't see myself marrying young or being a mother. I've had this conversation with my boyfriend quite a few times in the past and he always gets visibly upset. Today, the same topic was mentioned and again he got upset because I told him I'm not ready to think about marrying. I feel a bit guilty because he's a supportive and amazing person, and I love him immensely. However, I have personal goals to accomplish and I don't want him to wait for something I can't offer him.

I told my husband that I’m pregnant and I thought he’d be excited and he said he’d like a paternity test just to be sure. As if there’s any way he’s not the father of our baby. I feel so horrible that he thinks I’d cheat on him. I don’t have anyone to talk to. It’s fucking embarrassing that he thinks I cheated and I can’t even tell my friends

I don’t drink or go out to anywhere besides shopping or a friends house for dinner. I was a virgin when we met and I’ve only been with him. I don’t have a ton of guy friends or anything, just guys I work with that I talk to sometimes as friends and they know I’m happily married and we’ve never met up outside of work or anything. I don’t even know WHEN he thinks I may have cheated like I don’t just go out randomly. I go to work and sometimes to the mall alone. It’s not like I randomly disappeared one night and he has reason to doubt me. We go out together most nights. Like it’s just insulting and confusing.

I refused to do the test because I never cheated and he said my reaction tells him what he needs to know and if I were “innocent”, I would have agreed and not gotten angry. Of course I’m angry, I’ve never been with anyone else, only him. He knows I’m not even that type of girl to sleep with someone randomly. When would I have even found the time to cheat on him?? It just doesn’t make sense that he’s accusing me of this, I’m not that type of person. And this is supposed to be a happy time, we’re supposed to be excited and happy about our baby and instead he’s saying I cheated on him when I would never do that, it’s crazy. He got mad at me when I said no and that I’m disgusted that he doesn’t even trust me and he said it’s obvious since I’m making a big deal about it. Of course I’m gonna make a big deal out of you accusing me of cheating when I would never think of doing that. It’s insane",2019-07-06 00:16:25,371,177,relationship_advice

So I told her how I felt and even though I panicked and ended up sounding really stupid she was super cool and understanding and helped calm me down and all. But in the end she said “I have a friendship with you that I have with no one else and you could never mess that up” because I had mentioned I never said anything because I was afraid of damaging our friendship. I’ve taken this as a big fat “I’m not interested in you that way” and am doing my best to move on while still talking to her on a mostly daily basis over(texting for the most part). I’m doing much better than I thought mostly in part to her helping calm my nerves from the whole situation and her being so cool about it. But now I’m confused because I went without texting her for one day and she texted me that night asking if I was okay and said I was worrying her cause I was silent that day textwise.

I've been talking to a girl I know for a while now, she's turning 21 and I'm 20. I matched with her on tinder in December and we've been texting since then, except for a few weeks in February I think when she decided she wanted to go after someone she's been into for a while. Since then her and I have still been talking, I've never dated anyone before

We've hung out twice at my dorm but they were last minute things where I was drunk, the semester was ending, and I texted her asking to hang out. I've been going back and forth on this, before the semester ended and while e were texting I was really busy but also made excuses to not hang out with her because it made me nervous and specifically because hanging out with people I don't know too well makes me anxious too 

I don't honestly know if I'm attracted to her but she's told me before that she's been ditched after getting really close to someone and thinking they wouldn't ever break up and I'll so scared about hurting her and being mean that I've not done anything, I don't even think I'm in a position to date someone I don't even know if I can get through my junior year of college much less date someone which sounds pathetic I know. I just have no idea what to do and I feel like not making a choice and continuing the way things are is just making things worse. 

I know no one can tell be where or not to end things with her, I don't even know what we are we've never talked about it and I'm too afraid to even kiss her which I'm sure upsets her, but I was just hoping for an outside opinion I guess?? I'm sorry this post is such a mess

686,c9zjfm,BillNyethe911Guy,"My (27M) SO (23F) doesn't post me on social media, am I just insecure or is there a reason?","**Background:**

My SO and I have been together for about a year, we essentially lived together at my previous home, and have since moved into our own apartment. From my perception we have a pretty good relationship. We rarely fight, we're financially/occupationally stable, and we share similar views on some of the bigger pivot points when dating another human. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My Dilemma:**

It is fairly straight forward, aside from an occasional Snapchat story, I am an unknown presence to outsiders on her social media. Since we began dating she has switched her Instagram profile to public from private. Her best friend also has made a comment that no one knows we are dating because my SO doesn't post anything about us. Additionally, while not certain, I do not think it is a privacy thing for her because she used to and still has pictures of an ex fling on her Instagram. I have posted photos of her but have since stopped because I feel silly showing off a girl that makes me feel like I'm a secret.

I am bothered by this because it eats at my insecurities. I have an awful past with SO's cheating/deceiving me and it has made me feel pretty inadequate, albeit I am likely part of the common denominator in this because of my insecurities. My SO is aware of this and has realistically been more understanding than any other women I have dated. With that said, she has said some things regarding other men and past men that certainly didn't help this feeling, but she hasn't really been in a solid serious relationship before (she had some flings, but only really dated one guy while in high school) so I have chalked it up to inexperience and just the age gap we have. It just doesn't help when I reflect on this particular topic.

I have casually brought this topic up to her before and she is somewhat adovidant, so I am a bit lost as I haven't been able to get reasoning from her. I am looking for some outside opinion on how to navigate this or why this might be happening.",2019-07-06 22:26:00,10,3,relationship_advice

This was around 3 days ago. Well tonight I heard she was with her ex at the bar.   Safe to say I am devastated. I keep blaming myself because she was an amazing girl, but I just didn’t open up in time to fix stuff and make her feel how she wanted and deserved. I guess deep down I couldn’t let my guard down till I lost her and then it was too late.  I don’t know what to do with myself. She just told someone I know today that she loved me and misses me but needs some time to think. So here I am sitting and was basically praying I’d get another chance but I guess not. I’m just really lost and feel so empty. Just feels terrible knowing it was my fsult that I didn’t fix everything when she used to say she felt I didn’t love her. Also hurts to know she couldn’t fix stuff with me after I showed I could fix it, yet took back a guy who left her for someone else. Just absolutely lost and empty.

688,c9xomr,imokty666,I feel like my family doesn't stand me,"As the title says, I'm certain my whole family hates me and it got to the point where I can't bear it anymore.

Basically, I (17f) always had a tumultous relation with my family. I have one older sister (25f), with which I have never gotten along to. I know you may think it's just me being a teen and it's just in my mind, but hear me out, I need to explain a few things so I'm sorry if it's too long.

I moved to the UK 3 years ago when I was 14, the first year was desastrous, I got bullied at school and got really depressed. I'm not the type of person to keep it to myself when I'm feeling sad, so I tried to explain to my parents what was going on and how it made me feel. The result: my dad told me the bullying is totally my fault as in his mind no one picks on anyone for no reason, while my mom told me she feels bad for me, but never made an effort to listen to me or give me advice and my sister didn't give a care about me. 

I know it was a hard year for all 3 of them, but I really needed to talk to someone, I didn't have any friends at school or outside, the only friends I had were my friends from my home country, 4.000 kilometres away from me. 

That time has passed and I got over it on my own, 
I never made new friends though so I had no choice but to spend all my time outside school inside my house. I like being alone, but when I experience too much and I have no choice, it makes me really really sad. So I tried to befriend my parents and my sister, they were my few choices and I really tried to be as social as possible, making jokes and spending time outside my room as much as possible, always asking if any of them need help with something and even planning for family trips. Nothing worked out, my jokes were turned into ways of showing how "" disrespectful "" and "" not funny "" I am according to my dad, my help was invisible and we never had family trips without conflicts. I gave up, it seemed like I could never get closer to them, so I didn't want to hurt myself trying it again and again with no result.

These were years ago and nowadays everything is worse. My verbal conflicts with my family became physical, whatever the cause for the conflict, but it ALWAYS links to me somehow, so I am always the faulty one, everything that happens it is always my fault, my sister is always excused and I always get yelled at and grounded.

Today, I had the worst conflict ever with my sister. Now, to mention that because of the number of things that happened since I moved abroad, I have a treatment from the doctor to follow, as my mental problems have physical outcomes. My biggest problem is my anger management, I can't control myself when I am angry which I think it's because of the number of conflicts that happen within our family everyday. I can't keep calm anymore, it's just too much for me to take in and it shows. So, to make it short: I was making jokes with my aunt as I am currently on holiday in my home country  and my sister always gets upset when I make jokes ( tbh I don't really know why,I make jokes out of nothing with everyone  ) and she just suddenly got up and went into my room and took money ( my money ) as she said she paid for my hair to get done that day ( even if my mom told her to do so ) and she just took my money out of sudden. I got really really annoyed, mainly because I'm going to the beach with my friends next Monday and I have a tight budget. I stayed calm and asked her nicely to give my money back but she started being really stubborn and started yelling and shouting about me not being nice to her and not respecting her. She called me retarded and mentally impaired, and then I got gradually angry, I called her names back and I tried to physically get the money from her but she was pushing me and scratched me with her long ass nails. Then, the climax of the conflict, the point where I lost control, I told her to give my money back otherwise I will punch her in the face. She didn't and I kept my promise, I punched her and she started bleeding (not a big deal since my hands were also full of blood since her scratching ) and of course she started screaming and crying, excalating the situation. It wasn't even that bad I didn't broke her lip or anything. So she called my mom ( on the phone ) and talked to her for 15 mins or so. It was really painful what I heard, they called me crazy and stupid, my mom told me she doesn't want to see me or talk to me and my dad... I'm sure he was even angrier.

That was today, earlier in the morning, now we have a wedding and I feel like my sister told one of my relatives about what happened, but as you know, the "" gossip "" went from one to another and upon my arrival I've had a lot of disgusted face expressions looking upon me and not to mention I was literally ignored and not even greeted, even if I wasn't in the country for 2 years. Now, I am at that wedding and I really do feel like crap and my theory about what my sister did is growing stronger. No one is talking to me and it does hurt as they are my relatives. I really don't know what to do. I don't even know if posting here was a good idea. I really want to befriend my relatives, I want everything to be good, but I don't know what to do. Every gossip that is going on in my family is always about how unfriendly, uneducated and problematic I am, it is never good and my parents are not even denying anything. Please help me, if not how to deal with my family, but how can I care less about this? I really made an effort all these years to change myself so I can be likeable by them, but it seems like whatever I do is still not ok.

I'm sorry if it's too long, I'm really sorry. I tried to give some context relevant to my problem.",2019-07-06 19:39:09,3,5,relationship_advice

We probably just admired each other from afar. 


He’s a good looking guy, nice body, funny, was really sweet at first. 

We on and off talked for about a year. He drove to meet me at my college. Things started there. I lost my virginity to him months later when I graduated college a few years ago. 

He was confusing, and complicated, maybe slightly insecure. But he was also really sweet at times. 


Later he kept asking me for a threesome. (Our hookup session happened every three months for 2 years, mostly him initiating it). We never had a threesome, I refused. I knew he was wrong for me. I thought in the beginning he was serious, only to find out after months of talking that he probably didn’t want anything serious.

He later hurt me pretty bad by saying I was the worst person he ever hooked up with.....but he was one of the only people I’ve ever hooked up with. It mostly consisted of him jack hammering....and climaxing after 3 minutes. He would usually get his snot all over my face....idk how...but I’d never say anything bc why would I intentionally make him feel self conscious? 


We haven’t talked in over a year. But I did message him a witty message about his dating profile, since we are still matched and I was bored and scrolling. He told me I was beyond creepy.


Kind of hurtful, idk why I did that. He’s the only guy I continue to want to go back to. It’s wrong, I know that. But I am so attracted to him. I wish i could get past this! 

He constantly had me on edge. And upset . Why does this happen? Anyone else going through something similar ?

The two middle children are actually with his wife. Couple months later a girl starts and he wants to start something with her, she has boyfriend. Fast forward a year and a half, he's 39, she's 25, I'm 29. They're quite close, friends. She admitted that they've kissed on a night out but it meant nothing. 

She ends it with boyfriend and starts something with me, married guy becomes so jealous and starts bad mouthing me, won't speak to me. 2 months later she feels she wants to try it again with boyfriend. 

Eventually they split up - turns out boyfriend is abusive, and she's been dealing with it for years - and married guy has absolutely turned her against me, and convinced her he's the only one she can trust, and no one else in office. She tells me he's the most honest person she knows and she trusts him, tells him everything. I question how close they are and she says they're just friends and that's it, but since that comment they've stopped talking in office, will only text each other and colleagues have seen them wait for each other outside work.

I had things stolen from my desk, and things left on my desk - turns out married guy has been in office when he's not supposed to be, and it's been confirmed by another colleague who had to let him out the office, after he got locked in. Management revoked his work pass.

His wife has contacted HR to say she has received a text saying that him and this girl are having an affair, and it's been known by management - named our managers - and has requested an investigation. Management have no idea what she's talking about. Wife is saying it's a data leak, HR have asked for proof of the message. Married guy has obviously instructed this, as it went directly to a manager's direct line in another office, only accessible from our system - so has gone over the heads of our direct managers. 

If the message exists it's not come from anyone in work - it's been made to look like it's come from management to get them fired, I guess. My system has been hacked so I think this married guy is trying to get me and 2x managers fired - and I don't know why. If they're having an affair, why is the wife getting involved - surely married guy would deny it? If it's not real, what is the point of fabricating this? The girl I think is oblivious to the whole situation as she's been giddy and excitable in work, acting very strange. Like incredibly happy.

697,ca2u1r,thehiighpriestess,4 years// 4 days,"My BF &amp; I have been together nearly 4 years, living together for the majority. We have grown up together, and are both very invested in each other’s lives. We share the same friend group, purchased furniture together, moved out on our own, and even adopted our own dog a few years back. I’ve only ever loved him..and still cannot see myself connecting with anyone else on the same level. 
 
However, for the past almost year, he’s been doing many things to act out, then chucking it up to his depression or denying it altogether. We have one car, &amp; I work full time. He leaves me stranded at work almost weekly because he’s out cold not answering anyone’s calls or texts. once I’ve gotten home via UBER, he’d be completely odd when woken up. Acting almost lethargic..putting  on a different, cold personality, then claiming he doesn’t remember in the mornings. On top of this, he doesn’t ever do what’s asked around the house, even when reminded. I make a decent amount more than him, and always have. Neither of us have ever been upset by it, but it does mean I’ve contributed to the majority of bills as well..

Lately I’ve been finding coke hidden around the house. When confronted about it, he only argues with me. 4 days ago was when it all came to a head. We’ve been looking to move relatively soon, so I decided to check his phone in case any realtors had emailed back. We both know each other’s passcodes &amp; have been looking pretty heavily. He’s also he’s very terrible at following through, even when it’s just checking his email.  What I found instead, was receipts from the night before of cam sites and porn. He’d spent money on several websites while I was asleep in the other room. He was aware of my uncomfortableness with him watching, let alone paying for porn.. especially live cams?? Not only did I discover this, but I also came across more coke &amp; the proof he had bought it while I was sleeping too. I woke him up immediately, called him out, and told him to leave the key. He attempted to argue a bit and then left. 

It’s been almost four whole days and he hasn’t reached out... not for me, or our dog, or any of his stuff. I don’t know what to make of this. 4 years together &amp; all I can assume is that this is his way of showing his lack of care for me. I spent 4th of July alone, and he didn’t even contact me then. 

I guess I’m just looking for confirmation, or a decode of what may possibly be going through his head..

698,ca2tks,mr_rainyday,Just realized most of the meaningful relationships in my life are based on one-sidedly helping people,"During a conversation with my (22F) SO (23M) I suddenly came to a realization that most of my relationships with people who I have either been attracted to/close friends with follow a similar pattern. They come to me for advice about an issue that they have, and then I give them advice. I believe that whenever this happened, they would develop a strong bond with me, because I'm willing to listen and reciprocate. But whenever it comes to the contrary, I find it extremely difficult to confide or unload my own emotional issues onto them. Additionally, some of my friends will solely contact me only for the purpose of ""ranting,"" or complaining endlessly about their problems... honestly, until recently, I did not realize it has gradually been wearing me down emotionally. It's hard for me to go back to lighter topics or confide in mine when they don't seem as important.

Dating my SO made me realize that spending time with people doesn't have to always be a chore. I also tell him about my issues/vice versa and it generally doesn't impact the atmosphere of our relationship. Unrelated, but maybe I have trouble trusting people? 

Something that I really want to figure out is, how do I enjoy spending time with my close friends again? They're not my close friends for no reason. I still really like them and want to enjoy hanging out with them. How to keep our current friendship fun while also allowing for emotional vulnerability? After I do want to help them, but sometimes it's just too much.

699,ca0r5y,throwaway19694212,What qualifies someone to be your rebound? And how do you stop being desperate for love?,"Stupid question I know but I’m confused and need to get my thoughts out there, maybe someone has similar thoughts or advice.

Definition of rebound (Quora): A person is identified as having a rebound when he/she enters a relationship quite soon after a breakup. It is an undefined period wherein a person is involved in a romantic relationship while having unresolved feelings of their past relationship.

Sorry for the rambling, I know this is a long post but two of those guys, who I thought were really good friends despite the breakup, just decided to block me. I feel like life is trying to get back at me for being so stupid in love and hurting people... But this is not about me, it’s about the future and how to not hurt anymore people even with a stupid little heart like mine.

Here goes the stupid/endless story of my dating life in the past three years. Pretty stupid because I don’t know shit and I’m lost right now, and only recently realized dating was not as simple as it seemed (also, I have anxiety so I tend to overthink everything and that’s the perfect example of it)

So I (F19) think I need to go back in 2016, when I started getting very strong feelings for a sort of friend with benefits. I was young(-er) and desperate for love, so just fell straight into his arms and since he was nice and the sex was good, I just let myself go. Until he came crying to me one day, saying his girlfriend had just broken up with him. So basically I learned all of a sudden that 1)He had a girlfriend, 2)He was cheating on her with me... Unfortunately that didn’t keep me from being desperate for his time, so we kept on seeing each other (just for sex). I couldn’t let go.

Until this new guy came along... Tinder. He was from across the world, we never met each other in real life and the reason why he was saying that he loved me and other cheesy things is still a mystery to me. But about six months after that started, I noticed this super hot girl kept on showing up on his instagram stories etc. (yeah social media was super important for me back in the day), and as the stalker I am, I found out that this super hot girl was his ex-girlfriend... Or girlfriend should I say? Quite heartbroken...

I moved countries and decided I needed to stop focusing so much on love and start making friends instead, still a bit broken by this weird ass LDR... Until I met my first love. We were together all the time, I once again lost myself in love since I needed it so desperately, until I realized how unhealthy the relationship had gotten. Tried getting out of it several times but the need I had for love, cuddling and all the other nice things relationships can offer kept on taking me back to him. (of course there was a lot more to it and I honestly just loved him so much it hurt like hell breaking up with him over and over again)... I couldn’t say no.

Until I met this new guy. Perfect, perfect guy. From his appearance to his values, family, how he treated me in this relationship ( ,and the sex)... I thought it couldn’t get anymore perfect.

...And guess what? Until I met this new guy! Who made me realized I hadn’t loved the perfect guy in some time, but liked the idea of the relationship instead. Except the new guy lives far away, and it just isn’t the right moment for it. 

But my heart needs love so desperately, I can’t let go this new guy even though I know it won’t be anything. I feel lost without love. But at the same time I want to break this vicious, never ending story of “desperate for love-rebound-desperate for love-rebound”... 

I want to stop hurting people. I never did any of this on purpose and it’s only recently I realized I haven’t had a “break” of love in a long time, and this always ends up hurting people. I feel so childish for always falling back into the same pattern, disregarding the fact that I might hurt someone in the end... But I can’t help it

The reason why I consider most of those guys as “rebounds” is because they were people who came along my way while I was healing from my previous relationship. They made it a lot easier to forget the previous heartbreak, since well.. Since they gave me love. But in the end I never really had time to heal, since only a few weeks/months passed by.",2019-07-07 00:25:40,3,2,relationship_advice

I tried breaking up with my ex many times over the course of past two months. We’ve only been together for six months, including those two months of off-and-on. Break up reason: his debilitating depression and anxieties. 

He claims I’m the perfect girl and that I’m the only girl he’s ever loved — and will ever love. 

He says he’s not giving up and not letting me go. He wants to “get better” so he can deserve me, because he knows I deserve so much more. 

Part of me feels this is touchingly romantic — his undying loyalty and pursuit of me. On the other hand I find this concerning and alarming because he’s not respecting my choice to end the relationship. I feel like he’s almost manipulating me to stay.

702,ca2rqq,hennyhalapenooooo,Was my (25/f) exbf (25/m) an abusive narcissist?,"One of my exes was the standard model. Northern European, 6’5” tall, immaculate sense of fashion, handsome face, perfect voluminous blonde hair, muscular fit body, the whole package. He was just the standard catalogue runway model. 

I am an average-looking Asian girl. Nothing special.

Recently I’ve been reflecting on our relationship and I’m wondering if it was unhealthy. I’m most definitely over HIM but the treatment I experienced by him is still bothering me. 

- He always wanted my nails long, and preferred either white or black nails. When my nails were short and natural, he would wince and call them out asking, “what is it?” Like WHY I didn’t want long nails. He made an analogy; that I would still love him with a buzz cut, but I would be more attracted to his longer hair. 

- One time he didn’t let me go out of the house wearing a certain tank top I had because it was “long.” He asked if I had anything shorter (like a crop top). I had to literally get approval from him on the type of tank top I was wearing. Later when I got upset, he explained himself saying he stood by what he said, that that tank top didn’t do me justice to how “beautiful” I was. 

- He took me shoe shopping because he didn’t like my shoes. He bought me a pair of white adidas shoes. During shoe shopping, he got irritated in the store (one of the few rare times he actually got mad at me) because I didn’t know how to gauge how shoes fit me. He angrily asked me, “Have you ever bought shoes before???” In front of the employee. After he bought the shoes, I immediately switched it with my current ones. He took me to a full length body mirror and said, “see? The shoes really pull the whole look together.” 

- One time I wore longer black socks with those adidas shoes (slightly over the ankle). We were at a pizza place and he literally pulled my foot onto his lap and said I needed to wear white ankle socks with those shoes. 

- He has a lip fetish (dark lipstick and gloss) and we went to Sephora together to pick out colors and gloss textures he likes. I didn’t feel beautiful at all, but absolutely objectified. The entire time, I was running around the store trying on like 10-15 different lipsticks and glosses and looking for his approval. He looked unimpressed and stone faced the entire time, his eyes wandering around the store, until finally he gave a slight smile and nod to a gloss I bought. 

- one time when we were outside, he saw a girl wearing short shorts and asked what I thought about wearing those types of shorts. 

- he asked if I had a “goal body.” He himself was working towards a goal body (more muscle, gains). he said he loved my body and was happy with what he had, but didn’t like how I was insecure about it (I have always had body image issues). He then said he would like to help me and said I shouldn’t lose fat, but build muscle. 

- one time he looked around mannequin display clothes and said, “see that’s how I want you to dress.”

703,ca2rab,oof-kaploof,"My friend says she's ""in love"" with my bully, what should I do?","background info:

basically, there's a guy who we'll call Valentino because Valentinos I know are usually assholes (no offense, anyone named Valentino). 

imagine the douchiest, most annoying prick you can think of and you have Valentino. 

he's sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, and just an overall jerk. this is the guy who called me a blue-haired fag on valentine's day and told me to go back to mexico (i'm a mexican immigrant). 

he has also called my friends bad names but usually hates me the most (probably because out of my friend group, i'm in the most minorities).

so, one of my friends, let's call her Sophie, i of course rant to her and our friends about Valentino because he was being a *bit* of a bitch and what does she do?

she says being called a fag (multiple times) is ""no big deal"" and continues to defend Valentino as if he were the victim. this is coming from a white passing cishet by the way. 

and then a few months later she tells me who her crush is... you guessed it ladies and gentlemen. i don't even have to say his name.

anyway naturally my friends and i are just a *little* pissed at the fact that she likes this dude and we tell her so. she says that he's a nice guy if you get to know him or some shit and obviously that's not true based on the shitty way he treats people.

eventually she confesses to him. and guess what this dude says? he says ""sorry, i don't date white people"". (she's ukrainian but white-passing.)

and of course sophie is just like ""okie dokie"" and continues to excuse how much of a jerk he is to people. 

current situation:

this morning my friends and i (on our group chat) had an argument with sophie about valentino because he had said that homeless people are ""lazy and it's solely their fault they're homeless"" and she agreed with him. of course my friends and i are put off by this and continue to argue. 

at around 11 pm she texts me this:

❝I read a book, and somehow the compassion that the characters felt reminded me of what i feel for Valentino, the affection was only slightly similar and yet, it made me feel like somebody understood. If you read the book, you might just brush the surface of myneed for himwhy I can't live without him and why he's so important to me. Why just being in his presence brings me happiness, and as to why I feel completely lost without him. You might just begin to barely brush the surface of understanding my emotions for him. He's the first (and probably the only) person to ever make me feel this way. Calling him a ""crush"" or saying that I like him would be incorrect. I am completely in love with him, and call me an idiot or whatever else you want, but that simple fact will not change. I don't care if my love is unrequited because I will always love him and strive to surround him with happiness. I don't care how bad my life becomes, or how much dirt is thrown on my name, I will always care for him.❞

and i genuinely am speechless. she's always been the emo one of us (which a whole other problem, because she really gets on my nerves, always complaining and acting like she's the victim) (and she also basically self-diagnosed herself with disorders when she definitely does not have those mental illnesses) and for her to say she's ""in love"" with this jerk feels like the last straw for me.

we're young, and i don't think she actually loves him.

i've been trying to be supportive and so have my friends because we know she can be sensitive about her feelings and can go to dark places easily. i don't really know how i should deal with this- i don't want to sound like a jerk and tell her how she should feel or something but i hate the fact that she puts him over her friends.",2019-07-07 04:05:40,5,0,relationship_advice
704,c9y9gg,tradersnows,"My(21F) ex(20M) talks to others about how “crazy” I am. It stigmatizes my mental condition and interferes with my social life, and I need advice on how to handle it.","In general my(21F) ex(20M) is very diligent about telling other people people that I’m crazy and treated him poorly. From what I can see now, he always prioritized his romantic ideals and what other people thought of him. I also think he has some traits of covert narcissism. Some of my less close friends that have ties to him have also withdrawn from me and have become more skeptical of me in general. Because we are in such a small university in which he is in a “student leader” position, my reputation that was largely defined by him tends to precede me. 

For an in part explanation of where the “crazy” comes from, I do have C-PTSD and a panic disorder from some very real and deep stuff, but I keep it under control very well. My emotional triggers seem to be being gaslighted, lied to about things that effect me, and  hot&amp;cold behavior towards me. When this happens consistently, I go through an “episode” where I lose touch with reality and can continue to break down until crying/screaming and switching between fight and flight. Even though I do get dramatic, the closest thing I have gotten to mean or abusive to anyone has been accusing them of using me, intentionally hurting me, and not loving me. I do also yell because of the intensity that I feel, and I understand how this could be perceived as anger instead of distress, even though I am aware enough to say that I am distressed and not angry while it is happening.

Any time he treated me in a way that hurt me, I would try to talk to him about it and he would either go silent for a few hours or show me how upset he was at himself while doing nothing to truly fix it. He did lie often, try to pit me against other people, refused to stand up for me and our relationship to others, secretly spoke poorly of me, and much more. I shouldn’t have overlooked these red flags but I was just so caught up in feeling sympathy for him I didn’t even know they were there. These things eventually built up to where I started having panic attacks, especially when he got more “comfortable” in the relationship.

At the end, his greatest concern voiced towards me was that other people would see him as dating “that” girl with a panic disorder. He also wanted to take a one year break and then “reconsider” the relationship. He blocked me on everything after I stood up for myself and told him that I’m not waiting that long and that there’s probably someone else out there waiting for a chance with me that would treat me better/be a better fit. [in which I did find someone[24M] that I am in love with and in a much healthier relationship with].

Some of the things he and his friends have been saying(that aren’t true) that has interfered socially(because we go to a small college where many people we know are mutual):
I’m “crazy”
I was mean to him and 
I’m “spoiled rich” and don’t know how to work for what I want in life
I’m lazy and not capable of getting the degree I am in college for. 
I became “slutty” after we broke up and work
My experiences of being sexually assaulted in the past are a lie.
I’m a sociopath
I pushed him into ‘going further’ physically
I have “daddy issues”
I’m full of rage and blow up on people unreasonably

He’s also revealed lots of my personal information including past self harm and my abusive parent.

He even took it to Twitter and quoted a tweet about how men who treat women badly make those women appear to be the ‘crazy one.’ And said “no she was actually just crazy.” Multiple people who are friends with him and have mutual friends with me liked it.

Also, ever since the breakup, he has also tried to become more friendly with my friends, which I try to ignore but it also creates complications. 

I think one of the reasons why this bothers me so much also is that I still want the best for him, and him not letting go of the past concerns me for his sake also because I want him to be able to heal from the pain the breakup caused him as well.

TL;DR: My[21F] ex boyfriend[20M] is basically telling people that I’m crazy and I’m scared of how far it will get. I need advice on how to best handle this and how to remain secure in myself although I’m facing so many people with negative opinions of me and possible vendettas.

705,ca2pwd,BlueBomber97,Falling out with a crush who is also apart of my friend group.,"So my close friends and I have always been a pretty big group, consisting of a group of girls and another group of guys. Myself, and the rest of the guys, used to do things separately from the girls a lot of the time, and had a ton of fun together. Recently, I had started to date one of the girls in my friend group on a spontaneous kind of thing, never saw it coming, but we moved pretty fast. To make a long story short, she was never really that into me and kind of strung me along. I was fine with the idea of us not working out, but what set me off was when after we just agreed to stop things, she brings her ex with her on a lake trip that my close friends and I go on every summer. This made me resent her pretty badly, and because it’s still fresh, I don’t think its healthy that i be around her for a while. However, my guy friends make all their time to hang out with her, without me being there, and think it’s childish that I want to have time with them, without her being around. Is it wrong of me to want guy time with my friends, like we used to? I just want to be able to get over this, and I don’t feel I can do so if I see her every single weekend, but I also don’t want to have to go through it alone. I want to be around my friends.

The girl I was seeing still watches all my stories and she used to like my posts even after she had ghosted me. I haven’t posted in a while but I suspect she still would.

She was very narcissistic and my therapist suspects she had NPD. She was pretty emotionally abusive tbh and very self obsessed. She really made me lose all my self respect and made me feel like everything was my fault. I’ve unfriended her and unfollowed her on everything but she still follows me Instagram, I felt like a full block was a bit harsh and I’m also not really over her, so struggling to being myself to do it. 

I’m finding it really strange that she still follows me and she’s very active on social media, posts pretty much every day so I’m pretty sure she’d have noticed I don’t follow her anymore. 

I just find it a bit weird and slightly unsettling? Sometimes I wonder if she’s doing it purposefully to confuse me and keep me on the hook.

So me and my boyfriend are together for more then 2 years he is my first boyfriend but I'm like his third girlfriend. He is always caring and generous towards me.

So this all started when we were just enjoying a long drive. And his friend called him (Just telling his friend circle is very very big mainly guys) he called when I was saying some sweet things to him and he just picked it up so it was all normal here buy after putting down his phone he just takes a U turn.
When I asked him what happened he said that his friend needs some help this shattered me as he promised me last week that he will take me for a long drive and we just drives for like 10 min and he cancelled it.

So as he was drying he noticed that I was angry he asked me that we will go for ride tomorrow. I asked him that if he likes his guy friends more or me. He paused for a little while and said that his friends mean a lot to him and he loves them and they come first to him before me.

This word broke my heart I remained silent he dropped me my home and said sorry. I cried when I entered my room and started thinking about this. I don't know what to do should I leave him or do what

708,ca2p5p,BlindGuardian00,"Had a falling out with a friend, but I'm in love with his sister, what do I do?"," Recently, I (18M) had a falling out with my best friend (15M). We were extremely close and everyone could see it. But what made our friendship slowly die was the fact I noticed him using me for money, me talking shit about him one time, him constantly trying to get me feeling depressed, my constant suicidal thoughts, etc. We had a talk on the phone about 2 weeks ago, in which he said he doesn't want to be my friend anymore because I'm an ""Asshole.""

Now, here's the conundrum,

I'm madly in love with his sister (18F) (Almost 19). You can say I'm ""18"" and ""Don't know what love is"" but I honestly don't care, I love her. I know I do. He knows this, and didn't want me to date her (which may have been a reason why our friendship ended.) But here's the thing though, I asked her out to a movie during the last week of school, and she said yes, but we never went on this date since this situation with her brother. I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place, do I follow my heart and make things even worse between us? Do I just give up and loose the potential for an amazing relationship (Everyone admits we're perfect for each other, even him)? Would a relationship between us even be pragmatic because of this?

709,ca0mga,aspiringesl789,I never know when I am in the right or wrong in my relationship,"I (25F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (37M) for 4 years. After the first year or so, we began having a lot of problems. I can’t really call them fights per se, because mainly my boyfriend becomes upset with me all of the time. The “fights” we have usually are one-sided in this way. 

He is very sensitive and (self-admittedly) insecure and will read a lot into my actions. This is an example of an issue we had the other night: 

We were eating dinner at his place. He has one couch and a chair that we sit at in front of a TV. He was on the couch and I was in the chair (because I find the chair to be much more comfortable). He said something like “you’re not sitting next to me” at one point, but only as a passing remark. I didn’t realize he was seriously upset. The rest of the night he gave me the cold shoulder and when we eventually discussed what was bothering him he said that he was upset I didn’t sit next to him on the couch. 

I was so shocked this could be such a huge deal. He was in a bad mood the entire night and would barely talk to me. I pointed out that he doesn’t sit next to me on my couch at my place all the time and I’ve never gotten upset with him because of it. 

If I kept track of every incident like this I could write a novel. He gets so upset with me all the time over the tiniest things and it ruins our entire night and even the following days! I don’t understand why this happens. 

Was it inconsiderate of me not to sit next to him on the couch?",2019-07-07 00:12:24,4,2,relationship_advice
710,ca2ot6,biggerbears69,Incredibly unhappy best friend will not break up with SO,"So one of my best friends has been dating this girl for somewhere in the ballpark of two years. They used to be incredibly happy and loved each other a lot. However, things have changed recently.

They fight all the time, constant tension when they’re around each other. Even I can see it. She is always upset with him about something. He’s dead tired of her treating him like that. 

She’s about to go to uni, so they’ll be hours away from each other within months. That’s probably been a part of it.

Anyway, he loved (loves?) her a lot and cherishes their memories together, but is incredibly unhappy. He’s said he used to never even acknowledge other girls but now he really wants them. Our friends all agree that he should break up with her, because he would clearly be happier after getting over her. But as it is, he claims that he would be throwing away what they had. Feels like he would regret it. Fears that it could potentially get better and he’d break up with her not knowing that. He said he felt like he lost a part of himself when he thought they were breaking up. The constant emotional distress is really getting to him, to the point that he’s visibly upset even when hanging out with the boys.

Despite this, he never wants to be around her because he hates every second of it. She acts like an immature, petty child towards him and it causes constant arguments. When he has tried to have conversations with her about it she just gets pissed, refuses to speak, and ignores their issues.

I don’t know what to say to get through to him at this point. He will not break up with her, despite knowing he is completely unhappy and it will almost certainly not change. I truly believe their relationship has run its course. They’re locked in a stalemate, both getting unhappier and unhappier, but it appears that neither is making an effort to call it quits.

We met in college so he didn’t know I was 17 at first and we were just friends. After being friends for about four months he told me that I really liked me and that turned into love. What’s weird is when we use to hangout it was while we were only friends but I moved back home so I haven’t been able to see him for two months and that’s when we began loving each other as more. I’m super nervous to see him because I haven’t been romantic with him in person. Also he’s the first guy I felt like this for.

Now I know he’s older and he’s gonna want to have sex. He doesn’t really talk about it a whole lot but we’ve brought it up a couple times. He also knows that Ive only had sex once and that was while I was drunk so I don’t really have experience. 

Anyways lately I’ve been getting frustrated with him. I don’t like relationships and he’s no different. I hate the fact that I care about him so much because he could hurt me at any moment and even though he treats me really really good I’m just so nervous to be with him and and be around him. (I’m always nervous) I love him and he’s always there but a part of me wants to just stop talking. I’ve tried to do this several times and it doesn’t work out.

What I mean by that is I’ll tell him that since we don’t see each other and I’m about to move, that it’s probably a good idea for us to stop talking. I tell him specifically that I don’t want to be in this relationship and he’ll be on the same page and then he will say something like “You not going anywhere” (in a cute way) or he’ll get sad or I’ll just miss him and give in.

716,c9z5nc,IHateLebo,"I (24f) flew across the country to surprise my (27m) boyfriend, and I discovered that he had hired an escort a few days ago. How do I proceed?","I flew across the country to surprise my boyfriend who does seasonal work to celebrate our one year anniversary. It had been about six weeks since we had seen each other. I might catch some flak for this, but I was going through his phone while he was getting gas. We have an open phone policy, and I like to go through the funny banter that he has with his friends. 

While going through his phone I saw that he had texted his roommate ""might be having a weird night, I have an Eros coming over. She can just leave after a massage though, I don't care"" and then later, ""there are no rooms available. I'm pissed."" He was on the road for work and sent this to his hotel suite-mate at 5am. 

I obviously confronted him about it. After a while, the details that he ended up giving me were along the lines of he was belligerently drunk. He found her on Craigslist, and invited her over with intentions to cheat. When she got to the room, he couldn't go through with it, so she gave him a massage for ten minutes and then left. He insisted they did nothing intimate. He said his roommate was asleep in the bed next to him. I had him call his roommate and say verbatim ""I just came clean to my girlfriend about the night I had the girl over. She needs to hear what happened from your perspective."" His roommate replied that he was at the casino, came home and fell asleep and didn't know what they had done. 

I must admit that I was not talking to him for three days at the time he met up with her. I was being a brat and it was my fault. I told him I wasn't going to talk to him and I was just trying to prove my point. We made up quickly after the three days. I know it was immature, but I work 12 hour days and we live in a time difference so we don't talk a ton anyway. Normally just a goodnight conversation and a quick call on my way to work.

I'm devastated and never thought he would do anything like this. He has constantly berated cheaters. I asked if he wanted to be together still, and he said yes. I asked if he would do anything to fix it, and he said ""I don't know what you mean. I probably wouldn't do ANYTHING you asked. Anything implies a lot."" I asked if he would call his mother and tell her the situation, and he said absolutely not. He said ""I love my mother more than I love you."" I don't think he said this to be cruel, but it stung. I would never have made him, either, I just wanted to find comfort in knowing that he would do whatever it takes to apologize and have me begin to trust him again. 

How do I proceed? Do I accept the fact that although he had terrible intentions, he couldn't end up going through with it? Or is this relationship a lost cause because he tried to cheat? I live in his house that he owns and we have a dog together. I originally thought we were going to spend our lives together.

717,ca0hw5,mrmysterious98,(20M) matched (19F) off tinder yesterday and things are escalating quickly what do I do?,"So I matched with this gorgeous girl, I didn't expect her to respond to me as a lot of girls don't. Anyway we started talking and things were going great, they still are but we have a few differences which could be red flags. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first one was that her boyfriend of 4 years dumped her 3 days ago. I know 100% that this is just a rebound and I told her that's not what I want to be. She assured me otherwise but I just don't know I'd believe you can get over someone for 4 years in 3 days! 

&amp;#x200B;

The second was that she is into rough sex and choking. I don't know if I have it in me to do that however I told her I could give it a go. She's very sexually active and it kind of worries me she may just be in this for sex but she seems to be wanting a relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

The third was that I told her I wanted to take things slow and her response was just ""oh"". I think she wants to move very fast, she was telling me how she couldn't really have sex because it hurt her and I said that is ok it doesn't bother me sex is not urgent at this stage of a relationship, and then she was sexting me for ages which confused me a bit, 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on what I should do? I know it sounds dumb but just after talking to her for 1 day I know I really like her! She's beautiful kind and easy to talk to. I am just worried about getting hurt as everything seems to be going a lot faster than I'd like.  Is it best I distance myself and don't get too attached?

718,c9p1nf,Throawai34521,I (32M) am dating a girl (37F) who I think has a mommy fetish,"She's often found random reasons to baby me.
For example if I say I've had a hard day at work I'll get an 'awww!' and when she'll hug me in a way that puts my head on her chest even though I have to bend a little and she has to tip toe. When we cuddle I'm almost always either little spoon or she has me lay my head on her chest. 
She seems to want these things and I've never minded doing them, I actually like them to a certain extent so I let her.
Recently she's been more obvious, adding 'poor baby' to her 'awww's and often doing subtle baby talk. 
A lot of times our sex life caters towards me as she likes pleasuring me (not that she doesn't get her turns too, just that it's my turn enough to be notable)
There's also some more subtle things like her packing me lunches for work with napkins that include cute little love notes, I thought it was sweeter than most usual gestures and didn't think much of it until I recalled a classmate of mine in elementary who's mother did the exact same.
But the most obvious was a month or so ago when after a particularly rough day of arguing with her parents about some personal stuff she asked me for a sexual favor.
She wanted me to lay and her lap and suck her breast while she jacked me off. That's really what made me figure it out and after some research learned that it's a commonish thing called a 'nursing handjob'
I accepted and it was surprisingly nice, she has a nice lap and being that cuddled up was comforting.

It was enjoyable and I didn't know it before but I think I like being babied, at least to this amount. But I still felt guilty and gross simulating a mother/baby type thing but sexually, it felt wrong even if I really did like it.

To add some more gas to this flame, the other day she had me respond to a text while she was driving and when I unlocked her phone I saw a still opened half-way played pornhub video of some guy with an enema being put in a diaper. I pretended not to notice and sent the text. (I'm def not interested in that kind of stuff)

Is there something mentally messed up with me and her to be turned on by this dynamic and do you guys think it's wrong? I can't shake this guilt. 
Also should I address this or just let things keep going without talking directly about it?",2019-07-06 03:37:27,41,85,relationship_advice

We met through a mutual friend and started seeing each other, after talking for two weeks. We hit it off pretty quick, I enjoy his company and we have a lot in common. However I have run into a couple problems and I’m not sure if I can look past them. 

Firstly, when we first started talking we got to know each other. He had told me that he had an ex girlfriend of over 5 years and they had broken up about a year ago. He had told me that she had moved in with him at some point in their relationship and he was going to propose to her... until he found out she was cheating on him. As I am younger I haven’t been in a long term relationship and I don’t know how I feel about him being in a serious 5 year relationship in the past. I know his past shouldn’t define him, but it does bother me. 

Secondly, as we have been seeing each other he mentions marriage in our conversations. I’m still young and want to continue with my education. He says “why do you need school, when I (referring to himself) am well off and can provide for you ( talking about me)”. I honestly would love to settle down but I know he may want to start a family before he’s 30 years old and I’m not sure if I’m ready for that type of responsibility in a few years. 

Lastly, he is CONSTANTLY with his friends. He’s an amazing guy but I am the one who is checking up on him and he says he’s been super busy but he makes time to see his “boys”. I find it extremely annoying and I don’t know how to tell him I don’t like when he is with his friends 24/7 , but he’s a grown man. 

Any advice that I can receive will be helpful. I don’t know if I should continue talking to this man, as he seems serious about me but parts of his past still lingers in my mind and I’m not sure about marriage at such a young age.",2019-07-07 03:29:57,6,0,relationship_advice

I also am kind of still into my other best friend (15f) who I have asked out before.

But has now been wearing a t-shirt and shorts when around me [I unexpectedly caught her with her friends once and she was back to her sweatshirt-pants deal]) And has been hanging out a lot more with me lately (until she had to go to a summer camp).

Are you glad you did it?,"Looking for perspective - any fathers (parents) who don't have a relationship with their children and wish they did? Who would or would not want to hear from an estranged adult child? -- Anyone who reached out to a parent they never knew growing up? 

41F here who has not seen or heard from my father since parents divorced at age 5. There is no concrete set reason that I know of. He knows I'm alive. I know where he is and have debated reaching out to him off and on for years. My mother took me out of state when they divorced 35 years ago. She passed away about 15 years after that. She made it clear that she would not discuss or answer questions about him. She would only say that he had ""issues with women"" and that I (meaning me) was better off without him. But, she had severe emotional and psychological issues of her own and was not the most reliable source for information. 

Obviously I haven't done it yet. If I did reach out, it would be to at least have one interaction with this person I came from. I have no illusions or hopes that he would or could be the father he never was or that the interaction would be anything other than awkward and emotional - maybe something like closure? Or the idea of replacing the inevitable ideas or assumptions about him that my mind has created across all of these years. To replace it with a real human interaction with whoever he really is. 

But a thought that stops me is: if he wanted to interact with me, wouldn't he have? Should I leave him alone? I don't have kids, I haven't been married. I don't know what it is to have a child and then have the relationship fail.  I don't know what it feels like to struggle with money, stability, responsibilities and lack of steady work on the scale that it seems he has. He's not homeless, he has other kids. He's worked enough to now have a house (in his 60's). He's not been in jail. I think he's just didn't want to be a father? But I really have no idea. He lives in a distant state and I know very little about his life. We have no mutual living/active relatives, family friends, etc. He's a total mystery.",2019-07-06 23:42:11,5,2,relationship_advice
723,c9p7k7,justthatoboist,"Update: I (16f) have always known I was adopted, and investigation revealed that my parents had twins that died","Tl;Dr at end

First, I’d like to thank everyone for their advice and help on the last post. I don’t know how to link my previous post on mobile but if you go to my profile it should be either the first or second post you see. 

Second, when reading through the comments there seemed to be two of thought: that I was LEGALLY adopted and that I was ILLEGALLY adopted. I’ll admit, I haven’t had a proper conversation with my parents about it, but I went for my learners permit today and it revealed some things about some of those incomplete documents in the first post. 

So in my state you can apply for a standard license/learners permit or a REAL ID one. They require different amounts of documentation and because I’m a minor my dad had to accompany me to the RMV. This is going to actually be the most unbelievable part of the whole story, but the RMV was completely abandoned, and we were served immediately. I handed in my application and my dad gave them the documents. I took the test, and passed! Afterwards, I was asking him what documents we used, as he had them in a file and just showed them to the clerk, and in my state there’s a two page list of potential documents you can use to ID yourself to the RMV. I also asked why I was getting a Standard and not a REAL ID, which needs extra documentation. He said we’d handle it when it came time for my license. To be fair, 90% of those documents are work related things and I don’t have a job yet so we weren’t overrun with options. My dad handled my ID 100%. 

Now I’d like to talk about the two theories of legal vs illegal adoption and ask for some more advice. 

Theory One: Legal Adoption
This is the one I always believed. Let’s assume that my birthdate is between the first and fourth of the designated month (see first post). That would put my dad at age 53 and my mom at 36 when I was born. That’s relatively old to have a baby, let alone two, as the twins were born on the fourth. She always told me tales about being pregnant and having to go to the doctor almost every day. Given my parents age, I don’t see how it would be possible to steal a baby. Also, if my mom was in the doctors so much it explains why the twins didn’t live long. 

Theory Two: Illegal Adoption
Kind of just what I said above. Between my parents ages, certain medical restraints, ages at the time and just plain knowing them, I don’t think they stole a baby. 

However, several people brought up that I had many characteristics found in gypsies. Gypsies are Eastern European. To make a long story a short one, I have an adult female who married into the family and is from Eastern Europe. She has two kids about my age but I learned through one of them that she has a son in his twenties now who she gave up for adoption, and they now have a very strained relationship after he attacked her down. It makes me wonder, if she gave up one when unmarried, why not give up her first while married to her grieving cousin in laws? We have the same hair and eye colors and I actually feel like I look more like her than her three kids. The one she gave up for adoption looks nothing like her, her son with her current husband looks just like the father and their daughter together also looks just like the dad. I look a lot like her. 

I know that I need to talk to my parents, but I’m about to go away to a music camp for a week, and I don’t know if I should start this fire before I leave. The cousins mentioned above live far away, but I’m seeing them the week after my camp. Since I’ve tried to talk to my parents about this so many times to no avail, should I just try to talk to her? I’ve never asked her about this before. Would it be better to ask her first or my parents? I don’t think she’s even aware I know I’m adopted. I don’t want to look like a fool if she’s not my mother, but I feel like I need to know. 

Once again, thanks to everyone for their help. 

Tl:Dr: I have an adult cousin who looks a lot like me and has a history of giving children up for adoption. Also, my dad couldn’t present enough documents at the RMV for me to get a REAL ID for my permit.

EDIT: I forgot to mention something about DNA tests. My parents are the most levelheaded people ever and always come to rational conclusions and openly mock conspiracy theorists. However, I’ve asked many times over the last few years for a DNA test out of curiosity and whatnot and they refuse to let me do one as they don’t like “the government knowing your DNA”. Think like Shane Dawson’s conspiracy video where he talks about how Ancestry and 23andme are helping the government collect everyone’s DNA.

She's really flirty and has recently expressed an interest in dating me. I feel the same way and but live three hours away and told her about how I feel about it but we haven't really had a conversation how about it.

Yesterday we went out to a bar and I invited one of my buddies I haven't seen in foreve. Everything was going pretty well but I was kind of getting a vibe that she was like being just as flirty with my friend as she is with me. I thought to myself I was just overthinking it and chalked it up to the alcohol. There were some weird moments though; whenever my friend invited me out to go line dancing for the next day, she said she wanted to go with me but I told him maybe, as I already made plans. He told me to keep him updated but kept asking him how will she know the details. The rest of the night went well and we were clicking just like before

Today during our brunch date he got brought up and she asked for his number saying that she doesn't know many people who like country music and like to line dance and that I'll be out of town. She even told me that she felt weird asking it because if the situation were were reversed she'd feel like it was weird too. I told her it was weird and dropped the subject and I pretty reserved for the remainder of our date, but I think I played it off pretty well. Am I overthinking this? On one hand she just might be a flirty person and we haven't had a conversation about us being serious but I still feel like it's a dick move to ask for another guy's number while you're on a date.",2019-07-06 19:55:00,3,5,relationship_advice
725,ca0a65,The-Wondering-One,"My girlfriend (24f) and I (25m) are going to potentially talk about breaking up tonight, but I want us to stay together. I need some advice.","Advice needed: tittle 

Before explaining everything I want to say that, I have every intention to stay together, and I’m going to try my hardest to do so. 

Background information:

I have been in a (seemingly) happy relationship with my girlfriend for little over six months now. We both work a standard 8 to 5. We see each other about every weekend. She always seems a little upset or sad if we only are together for one day of the weekend, and not the full weekend. 

I usually ask her to come over to my place, because she says she doesn’t think her apartment is sufficient enough for two people. I have asked her a couple times about cooking together at her place, to no avail. 

She often says that “I want to live together with you.” I feel the same way and say the same thing back. Unfortunately if we want to do that she would have to move in with me, until my lease is up next April. Because of that, we haven’t talked much about actually doing it. 

She also sometimes says something around the line of “hurry up and marry me” in a somewhat playful tone. Before this event, I was all for this idea. I’d like to, just in the future. 

English is not my girlfriend’s first language, so we sometimes have some communication issues. Although, we have been able to get through it, so far (until recently). 

Her birthday is coming up soon, and we have a trip planned and booked to visit the United States in late summer. She has spent a decent amount of money already, for this trip.  

She also has a coworker that reminds her of me, and that she used to like, when he was married. (more on this later). 

What happened:

Last weekend she stayed at my place, as usual. We played video games, watched Netflix, cooked together, etc. The normal stuff we usually do together.   I told her, that I wouldn’t be able to see her on Friday, the following week, because I had volleyball practice and a volleyball tournament Saturday morning. But I told her that I could see her Saturday night. She then says, she is going to “punish me” because I didn’t tell her about the practice and tournament, far enough in advance. She said she won’t meet me next Saturday. We were eventually able to agree upon seeing a movie together on Sunday (today). Just after she leaves, she messages me saying, “I already miss you.”  This made me think, “hmmmm does she really intend on not seeing me if she is already feeling this way?”

The next day (Monday) was a seemingly normal day. We messaged each other regularly and called each other. I said “I love you” (like I usually do) and went to bed. She said, “I love you too” (also normal). No problems at all.

Tuesday is where things get a little strange. 
The morning started off fine. Nothing out of the ordinary. We messaged each other as usual. Although after work she sent me a extremely strange message. She said, “If I get caught up with a strange person, can you help me?” I immediately messaged her and asked if there was a problem. She said. “maybe.” I call her, but she didn’t answer. She then messages me saying that she is on the train and she “escaped.” I started to leave for the subway, to head towards were she lived (I only know the area she lives in, not her apartment). While heading there I told her to call me once she gets back to her apartment. She said she will do that. Time passes, still heading over to the station, I call her again (because I’m paranoid). She answered saying she just got back to her apartment. I asked her, “do you want me to go to your apartment?” She says no I’m safe you don’t have to. Then I asked, “do you want me to go to your apartment?” She also said no. I then ask her about what happened. She says she doesn’t want to talk about it. After asking her countless questions all I got from her is that, there was a gross man involved in what happened. We talk a little more about random stuff and she goes to bed early. (I was really worried for her)

On Wednesday (still worried) I messaged her in the morning. I asked how she was feeling. She never responded. She then apologizes for not being able to see me on Saturday. I said, “Don’t worry about it. You probably have things you want to do that day.” I then ask her about were she wants to go for her birthday. She doesn’t respond (left as “read”) I then ask her if she is okay. Doesn’t respond. Now feeling extremely worried I asked if I can call her. She reads it and says “I'm okay! But I can't call you.” I told her, “as long as you are okay that’s no problem.” 

More details on what she was actually doing later.

Here comes Thursday. I messaged her in the morning.  Everything seems normal (I’m at least a little less worried). Thought the entire day she doesn’t message me. I thought, “well maybe she is busy.” I send her a message about what happened at work. She responded with two words only, “sounds fun.” This also seemed strange to me, but this was during work hours so it was understandable. Later that night, I messaged he saying that I missed her. She leaves it as “read.” (This is very strange because she always tries to cheer me up in some way if I am feeling sad or lonely.) I then sent, “goodnight” and she responded saying “goodnight.” 

Friday comes. We message each other in the morning and talk about our plans to watch a movie together on Sunday (today).  I then suggested to get lunch before the movie. No response. Left on “read.” I asked her if she had free time on Saturday, “what about meeting on Saturday?” No response. Left of “read.” (This is all before work has started for the both of us.)
She calls me after work and says she doesn’t feel the best and that she can only meet Sunday. (More on why she feels that way later.) I send her a message saying, “I hope you feel better soon.” No response. I said “goodnight.” No response. I said “I love you.” No response.  All these messages were left on “read.” (At this point I’m a freaking out in my head, because this isn’t normal) 

It’s Saturday, day of the volleyball tournament. I messaged her in the morning, but yet again, no response. She left them as “read.” (I’m thinking fine, maybe she wants to sleep. It’s the weekend after all.)
I messaged he later in the day asking if I can call her at night (which would be after the tournament). She then calls me right at that moment. I said that I want to talk to her about the volleyball tournament and “something else” after it’s over. She said okay. (That something else is questions about why she has been acting so weird.) the tournament ends and I’m able to finally call her.

The phone call:
I tell her about the tournament (she lets me know it’s a boring conversation). I asked her if I was being annoying. She didn’t respond. Then I told her “you can tell me anything you want, I’ll listen.” She finally told me why she was acting so weird. Turns out on Wednesday after work her coworkers (which she used to like, also now divorced) took her for a drive. During that time her coworker told her that he likes her. So, because of this she has been acting strange, and not feeling well. We then get to the topic of our relationship together. She starts listing off complaints about me. She said she wants me to plan dates more, with less uncertainty. For example see X movie then go to Y restaurant. I said, “okay I can do that.” She then says, “really? you will do that?” in a quizzical tone. I said “I will.” The next thing she said was that I should help more with our trip to the United States. I said, “okay will do.” Another complaint is that it is sometimes difficult to communicate with each other. At first she thought it was fun struggling to talk and then quickly open google translate or a dictionary app. Although now, it is stressful when talking about something important and one of us doesn’t understand it. The last complainant was that I am not very fashionable. She said she told me to be more fashionable, and I said I’ll try. But, She says I haven’t tried. I said “okay I’ll try to.” (Although I’m now wanting to talk to her about this, because is it really important?)

She then follows with a big question. “What would you say/do if we broke up?” I was feeling heartbroken just from hearing that question. I responded, “If you truly don’t feel like being with me anymore that is okay. We can break up.” She said “okay” then she asked “shall we do that?” I told her, “if we do, do this, I want to talk to you in person and I want us to explain each other why.”

That’s what we’re going to do tonight after the movie. We plan on eating at a restaurant and I was thinking about doing it there. How should I go about this situation?

Bonus info: 
Before leaning that this coworker likes her, she planned on going to his apartment to help give advice on rearranging his apartment. Then going out for dinner. I said it was okay (at the time) if it was something she really wanted to do. (She said she wanted to help him out, because she helped him out before). This will be the first time they meet outside of work, is what I’m told. 

TL;DR
My girlfriend has been acting strange because a coworker said that he liked her and now I think she wants to break up with me. 
I need some advice.

I just really like spending time with me and hope she feels the same way about me too.

I don’t know if I’m overthinking this but the fact that she said specifically when she gets back and that we should do something then sounds like a good sign right? I imagine that if she wan’t interested then she wouldn’t even include this part. Also would asking her to boba like this sound like a date since it’s just gonna be us there.

727,ca2c5t,2legit4thisshit,Communicating the problem always works in his favor,"Me (25fm) and my husband (31m) have been together for at least 7 years. I wanna die sometimes. Everything is okay except for one major problem. When we have certain issues I always try to communicate. But he never acknowledges my feelings. It doesn’t matter what. I’m always wrong and he’s never wrong and if he was wrong there was a good reason and I should understand. 

It’s tiring. I have to constantly walk on eggshells in order not to upset or hurt him yet he literally doesn’t give a fuck how I feel about the way he treats me. 

He’s good to me 80% of the time. But that 20% really makes me depressed. Most of the time it feels like I don’t even know what I did or said wrong for him to get that mad at me. I  got married because I truly love him. But sometimes I wish I hadn’t. I’ve tried so many times to try and be better but it’s never good enough. I still say or do the wrong thing. He always has his reasons to be mad. But when he isn’t mad he’s great. I don’t know what to do",2019-07-07 03:17:53,3,1,relationship_advice
728,ca2awe,ItachiUchiha1997,Am I in the friend zone or she really likes me? Some advise please,"So, there is this co-worker of mine. It's been a year since we met. Initially while getting to know her, we sort of hit it off since we were connecting on different things and topics and I really felt something for her. Things go on, we keep going out with a group of friends, she was really a good person at heart. She used to subtly indicate at a lot of times that I was a really good friend to her. After a while I sort of couldn't take it anymore, I confessed my feelings for her and she was actually speechless at that moment, I let her know that I'll want to stay distant from her try to forget her. Later over a week or two, She tried to convince me twice or thrice to talk back to her. But I was stern that I wanted to forget her, as my feelings had intensified over a couple of months. 8 months later, she tries to convince me again and I sort of give in to her explanation. She wants to keep talking to me and so on but she mentions that she has crushes but never felt like pursuing a guy in her life, so she'll never be sure if she would like me in the same way. The main cause of my confusion is that, I always feel that she likes me whenever we interact, I've seen no girl sharing so many things or being so playful with me while just being friends, it's probable that I'm very naive. Moreover, this girl has another female friend, whom I used to hang out with a lot. We were just friends. But this girl has indicated at different times about the female friend having a boyfriend and how I should stay away, subtly always. After this whole episode that lasted over 8 months that I don't talk to her, avoid her, I know it's really selfish but that was for my own emotional stability, I fell head over heels in love just about in 2-3 months. We both went out recently and I really felt that she liked me, It was just the both of us but quite a beautiful day for me which I'll probably remember all my life. We will probably not be seeing each other after a few months, she has a traveling job and I'll probably leave mine to join the armed forces. She knows about this and keeps asking when we would meet again in life. I keep telling her that I'll always find time for her, just a cheesy thing I say. Please know that we live in India and I'm 22 and I have no relationship experience, probably as I was never talking to girls invested in reading and my guy friends always. Sorry for the long post! And thank you very much for reading this far.

Today i told her i got issues with self worth that i need to work through before i can go any further and that i don't know how to fix it. She said she will think about how she can help me.

20 minutes ago she broke up with me because I'm not ready to propose and she is getting hurt because we obviously don't want the same thing. And she asked me about it many times but I'm always saying i need to be ready.

Which is true, i really feel that proposing to someone before I'm ready is dishonest and she deserves better than a lie.

730,ca0682,The-Scarlet-Starlet,I don’t feel beautiful,"I’ve been with my boyfriend a little over a year now, and he used to really bring up my confidence. He made me feel like one of the most attractive beings on earth. That I was the only one for him, and that made me crave his attention more. But in sight of recent events where he has been more complementary of over women’s sexual attractiveness I just haven’t been feeling entirely attractive. 

He never really compliments me anymore, and when he does it sounds forced and lacks context. For example, he would occasionally call me pretty and as normal I would deny it , explaining how I need evidence. But his evidence is, “Because I said so.” And just having this bland response makes me feel a little sad because it lacks context. It’s never, “Your hair looks so beautiful today because of its natural curls...” I just feel like he would rather be complementing someone else and not me.

I just feel very alone, and caged. I’ve gained weight, not much but more than I’m used too in the last year which might attribute to this. Or that my boyfriend likes girls wearing bralets or lace bodysuits which I’m not confident in wearing. 

I don’t know, this is more of a rant really. I’m just uncomfortable with myself and I’ve tried explaining that to him. But he can’t get that through this head, and I just need some advice",2019-07-06 23:27:33,9,2,relationship_advice

So just some background info: we’ve been dating for about a year and the beginning  (the honeymoon phase) was perfect! He was so patient and loving. We told each other that we loved one another pretty early on in the relationship too. After the honeymoon phase fizzled out things were still nice just not the same as they were in the beginning, around this time I started to want to hangout with my friends a little bit more because when he and I first started dating we only spent our free time with each other. At first he was fine with it but eventually things kind of took a turn, whenever I said I made plans with my friends he would get upset and sad because he felt like I wasn’t spending enough time with him. I started to feel really guilty for hanging out with other instead of him mostly because he was trying to make me feel like that. Not too long after that he started getting really territorial with me, he would get upset with me for wanting to spend time with my parents without him. 

Pretty recently I had a very sad thing happen and a friend of mine offered to bring me food to work, my boyfriend got upset with this because he wanted to come visit me and only see me. 
I’m kind of at the point where I’m not really sure what to do. I still really love him but I really can’t tell if he’s in love with me or is in love with the thought of me.

I haven't been in very many relationships, and don't usually enjoy putting out for fear of something not working properly, and embarrassing myself and/or hurting someone's feelings.

The beginning was very much how one would expect it to go, so i got some help from the doc who prescribes me something to help, and our sex life explodes! Sometimes i don't even need the help prescribed, but when i do 4 times out of 5 it works great. The thing is that there are still times when i strikeout even with the help, which happens, i get it. 

We still have great sex the other times, even if i don't come, i love every second of being with this woman.

I do what i can to make sure she gets off whenever the opportunity presents itself, and i feel like i'm doing a good job because she says she's satisfied (she'll let me know if i did a subpar job haha).

My girlfriend has a spotty past with abusive relationships, and was told it was her fault if anything went awry in bed. She feels awful when i don't finish, and i feel like a monster for making her think she's less than perfect. 

I have no idea what kind of help i should ask for, or how to feel anything other than guilt. I know neither of us is to blame but i feel awful, and i'd really like to know what the internet's thoughts are on something like this. 

Thanks in advance!",2019-07-06 17:00:36,7,7,relationship_advice
744,c9zvfz,kirstersj,"I can’t stand my mom anymore, I fear she resents me or she’s manipulating me. What should I do?","Hello all. Sorry if this is a bit all over the place. I’m at ropes end. 

My mom has consistently been one of my favorite people in my life. We are pretty close, and have been close for most of my teenage years (I’m currently 18)

About a year or two ago she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I watched her go from this active bubbly woman to someone who rarely left her bed. It made me heart broken, and I did everything I could to be there for her. I took her to doctors appointments and physical therapy. I took care of her on her worst days. I cooked for her and I cleaned her room. I even took over some of her work duties. She eventually found the right type of pain medication to help her, and I thought things would get better. And they did. 

But then I started to notice a change in her mood. Every day I would come home and she would have an attitude. She would accuse me of not helping her enough, and say that i am disrespectful. If she wasn’t acting angry towards me, then she’d be sad. She would constantly make me feel guilty for leaving the house to go hang out with friends, she would cry and complain. She would claim she was in pain and I was not helping enough. I noticed however, that she only ever was in this horrible bad mood when I was around. it was only me getting targeted with anger and sadness. If she went out with friends or was with my other siblings she would be smiley, happy, and her normal self. 

Now whenever I see her it’s a guarantee that she is going cry, complain, yell, or be passive aggressive. She brings down my entire mood. My siblings and I cannot laugh and have a good time because she will come into the room to complain about her problems if she hears us all together. She also calls me 24/7, and if I don’t answer the phone calls she gets angry and texts me with a lot of hostility saying to “answer my fucking calls”. I have tried to confront her about this behavior, but that is only met with her making me feel bad/guilty for even saying anything. 

The reason I say I fear she might resent me is because when I was little (age toddler to 12) my father was physically abusive to me. I was terrified with him and my mom made me feel safe, so I often ran to her when I was hurt or scared of him. She started going to therapy a few years ago and one day she came back and told me that her and her therapist believe that I put a strain on my mom and made her feel stuck and unable to take care of herself because she was my constant protector and caregiver back when my father was abusing me. I feel guilty and I feel like she is holding a grudge on me for that. 

I can not stand it anymore. I love her, and I appreciate all she has done for me and I don’t want to lose my relationship with her, but the only thing I’m met with anymore is anger and sadness from her. It feels like she hates me, and I’m just here to serve her. We used to have fun together and watch our favorite shows and play board games and go out. Now she’s just permanently rude and sad and only wants me around to do chores for her and I seriously fucking hate it. I dread seeing her name pop up on caller id. I hate going home because I know she’ll be there. Even the sound of her voice calling my name is starting to annoy me to no end. I feel like a shitty kid for saying all of this, but I don’t know what to do anymore. She is actively ruining and sabotaging any relationship we had. 

How do I go about mending this, and getting to the bottom of her anger towards me? I miss my mom. The women she is now doesn’t feel like my mom.",2019-07-06 22:58:20,2,2,relationship_advice
745,ca214g,LetsGetThisBread2467,Do I voice my concerns or deal with it?,"Ok to start it off, before college got out from the summer, this girl and I really hit it off. We had been friends for about 6 months before so the whole thing just felt natural. However she was dealing with a past break up and was not ready to fully commit. 

Now I got a call from her today saying she was ready to try again and that she had gotten over her breakup. We ended up talking for over and hour, and honestly I couldn’t be more excited. The thing is she told me that she started smoking pot a lot.  In the house I grew up in, pot was never seen as something that was ok, but I did grow up around alcohol. 

This is where it becomes tricky because I’ve never seen any benefits come from someone that smokes pot. All of the people in my life that have done it have gone really nowhere so that is the only prerequisite knowledge I have on the subject, and that’s why it bothers me. I guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with it if she did it sparingly but the way she told me seems like the exact opposite. 

I really think we hit it off, and would be sad to see if this was the thing that made it not work. So do I voice my concerns before I ask her out or do I wait until after and some time passes? The only reason I could see for the latter is that some people could do I don’t have a reason to care if we aren’t dating.",2019-07-07 02:43:47,3,0,relationship_advice
746,c9s5ap,ythrowawayinvisibley,Am I [24F] in the wrong for not wanting to be involved in my father[54M]'s wife family?,"So my mother passed away some years ago and shortly after my dad decided to pursue a mom's old friend, who he got married with.
My mom's family got distanced after this situation.
Dad's wife doesn't understand why my mom's family got distanced and she keeps saying that she wants to get along with them. I think dad's wife is in the wrong to want that.
Anyway now dad is involved a lot in her new family and people, but sometimes happens that dad's wife's family want/say things that me and my brother should be more involved with them.
Honestly since I met them I never had a good feeling about them but I just keep a lot of distance. Don't want to get involved in their life and I don't want them. 
My father however doesn't think the same. And we clash on this.

So I am wrong to not want to be involved in dad's wife family? 
Is there a way to be diplomatic ? Unfortunately dad tends to not have ideas on how to keep separated certain things. 
I think he should keep business with his wife and family distanced from me and my brother but my father instead wants to create the same thing that there was when mom was around. 
But that won't unfortunately can happen.

The problem is that if I also raise some discussions he thinks I am influenced by mom's family but my mom's family doesn't know so many things and I also got distanced myself from them to avoid more problems with my dad.",2019-07-06 10:27:13,10,19,relationship_advice

748,c9zt21,Duceowen,32 (M) my wife 25 (F) and I tried an open relationship and now my feels have changed,"So it all started when work sent me to Texas for a week. I downloaded a dating app and was looking for women to hook up with. Nothing happened but after I got home my wife went back to Washington to do some work. While she was gone she went and saw a movie with an ex boyfriend. She told me that he was the only one who ever made her squirt. So having already been okay with the idea (she went to New York last year and I thought she was going to hook up with someone) I suggested that she should try and hang out with him again and see where things go. Told her I'm interested in other women and maybe we could have sex with other people and still love each other. 

We talked about it a lot and both of us seemed pretty excited about the idea. I've re-downloaded dating apps to try and find someone nice to talk to. She's going to hang out with him again and I think oh she's going to do this so I convince one of the girls I'm talking to that we should hang out. So the day comes and wife's out with dude and I'm with other girl. I end up hooking up but she doesn't. I tell her I did and she's heart broken. I feel like shit because I thought she's okay with it.

She Flys back the nice day and when I see her she is really intimate and I feel like shit. We talk and have sex but something feels different. We talk more and she decides when we move back to Washington we are going to split up. I'm sad but I understand. I try to focus on work and our son and just enjoy what I have. After a couple weeks I've come to some sense of terms with it and not trying anything find a person back in Washington who has literally all the same hobbies and likes as me.

I start talking to Washington girl and she's great she makes me smile and laugh and happy. She feels the same about me and it's nice to be liked. Wife finds out that I'm talking to her because she asks and I tell her. Tell her I'm developing feelings and she gets upset. Next day she's so glad we are going to work on things and stay together. I'm confused, we have morning sex and afternoon sex and middle of the night sex but something feels different I don't feel connected like before.

I finally tell my wife that I'm not sure if we are going to work out I really like the feelings I get just talking to this other person. I feel bad because I love my wife but every day I feel stronger about this other person. I don't know what to do. Last night I told her I want to chose me over us and she begs me to wait until she can figure herself out grow and be the woman I need. I'm willing to try but part of me wonders if ill ever feel the same again.",2019-07-06 22:51:50,4,2,relationship_advice
749,ca1yxj,anonymouschick08,So I Won the Powerball... In DESPERATE Need of Relationship Advice,"For some, this may be difficult to digest/believe, but I won several million dollars in the Powerball very recently. I bought a few quick pick tickets. I'm choosing not disclose the actual amount for privacy purposes, but anyway, that's beside the point.

As of right now, the only people I've disclosed my winning to is my parents. I'm currently in the process of finding a financial advisor and team that I can TRUST, which, believe it or not, is a fucking task. But I suppose the point of this post is to seek some help as to how to handle the pressing issue of telling my partner.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a boyfriend whom I met last year around September in college, and we started dating in January. It's been almost 8 months now, and we've both since transferred from that particular school and have been doing the long-distance thing since mid-May. Our relationship has been rocky... we're both young (under 22) and learning. He's a genuine guy, and we've even had late-night discussions about what we'd each do if we won the lottery (ironic, right).

My worry is that the dynamic of our relationship will completely shift. Although we love each other, ANYONE would be tempted to become not-so-genuine in a situation where their partner becomes spontaneously rich. I really want this to work, because he's someone who loved me before I came into this wealth. I'm pretty much a loner and although this is unhealthy as fuck, he's my only real friend. I don't want to spend the rest of my life lonely and depressed like most other winners. Is marriage and a family even realistic now? Can I get some advice??",2019-07-07 02:36:58,20,0,relationship_advice
750,ca1yn8,throwawayyy975313579,What to do when married to an amazing partner but not so great husband.,"I feel bad saying ""not so great"" Because he (34m)  is an amazing partner when it comes to supporting our family,  doing dishes,  taking care of yard work,  garbage,  cars,  after dinner clean up,  etc.  He can be a great father,  teaching our 2 girls,  (4 and 2)  new things,  being silly, playing,  going on outings as a family, reading books. 

Our house can be so negative sometimes.  And it's so hard.  For all of us.  The girls screaming, (picture an exorcism) both of us loosing our patience and yelling.  I try not to fully blame the negative atmosphere on him because,  let's face it,  I snap sometimes and I can be nasty to the kids when I reach my breaking point.  But I often try to make excuses for them.  They are little,  they are hungry,  they are hot and cranky,  tired,  anxious,  trying to get our attention,  jealous of each other. The list goes on.  But while I do reach my breaking point over time,  I feel like he looses patience immediately.  There are no excuses.  He acts like he hates them and me at times.  And I've brought this up.  ""He's working on it"" But we don't need therapy.  Common phases said to the girls are ""what's wrong with you,  why would you do that"" ""This kid is a real genius"" ""They fucking suck"" ""I'm not dealing with this shit,  here you go"" (Passing them off to me)  

Im so in love with him.  I really am.  But then I hate him in these moments. Parenting isn't easy though,  so I try to sympathize with him. We all loose patience sometimes. 

Outside of the kids,  I also feel like I'm not getting what I need.  We have sex, fairly often,  and it's great.  But I feel like that is the only time I'm touched.  I'm longing,  so badly to be loved in a physical,  non sexual,  way.  Rub my back,  hold my hand,  spoon me,  cuddle on the couch,  brush your hand against my back while I'm cooking. I will try cuddling and offer to watch different shows at night but I always feel like I'm cuddling with tree,  not getting anything back.  Our children are amazing but they are sucking out my soul everyday and I'm just drained and empty by the end of the day.  I just need to know someone has my back and appreciates me.  Im also beginning to question if he is a narcissist,  since everything is always so negative and he is always super defensive.  He will text me he loves me each day he's at work but then is so snappy and short with me when home. (Not to mention,  always looking at his phone) 

What it boils down to is that neither of us are perfect.  Therapy would be a huge help but is denied anytime I bring it up.  I hate to even think of this but...  Do I stay with someone who acts more like a great roommate who plays with the kids sometimes until they get cranky,  despite feeling like I'm not truly loved?  Is being short,  and snappy to our kids enough reason to change our whole family dynamic and living arrangements when there is still a lot of positive things the children get from having him here? 

(Adding that things are never truly physical,  maybe just a little smack here or there for fighting siblings.  It's more verbal threats and hateful language) 

Is this just a phase?  Will it get better once the kids are older?  Everyone goes through rough patches.",2019-07-07 02:36:01,5,1,relationship_advice
751,c9ycg3,Under_my_cumbrella,Am I wrong for cutting my father out of my life?,"I (F21) want to apologize in advance as this will probably be quite the long read. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents were together up until 2 years ago. My father, we will call him Jay, was never the nicest man. Jay is an alcoholic. He is very emotionally abusive, physically abusive when drunk or angry, and thinks he is above everyone including the law. Almost every birthday or holiday we celebrated, Jay has made is about him. He would throw a tantrum about God knows what (usually work), punch or break something, storm out and lock himself in a room with his iPad until we go apologize to him. My sister, mother and I always tip-toed around trying not to upset him. Of course we were kids, made mistakes and weren't perfect, but we tried our best. 

&amp;#x200B;

About 3 years ago shit really hit the fan. Jay set me up with one of his employees, after hanging out for awhile, dating for a year and a half and then got engaged. Jay was happy with engagement, loved my fiance (now husband) and seemed truly happy for us. Fast forward to about an hour before my bridal shower, Jay threw a tantrum about work and how we are having a lot of company over. Yet again he punched a hole in the wall, yelled at my mother and I, and locked himself in the shop for the duration of the bridal shower. He refused to come in to say hi to family and friends, whatever. The tension grew until our wedding social. Weeks before the social we asked all the parents not to drink, including my husband and I. We didn't want to single out Jay, so we thought a blanket statement would work best. 

&amp;#x200B;

The night of wedding social my sister and I were picking up last minute items for the social, and when we came back home Jay was drunk in his shop. Sent a willing family friend in there with some coffee to sober him up. While that was going on we had the bridal party over for BBQ and drinks beforehand. At the BBQ Jay came out hammered, refused to talk to my fiance (R) and I, glared at us, and stayed 5 ft. away at all times. He loudly proceeded to tell the best man that B would be ruining his life if he got married to me. I brushed it off trying not to start any drama. Jay heads over to the hall to set up, I pull R back and ask him if he can just ask Jay if everything is okay, and just to ensure that we are all going to have a good time tonight.  We get to the hall and Jay is out smoking, perfect opportunity for B to talk to him. I start setting up the hall, and abut 20 minutes late R walks in crying and angry. Best man and I head to R to see what happened. For the last 20 minutes Jay was telling R how much of a piece of shit he is. I run out yelling at Jay to sober up or get the fuck out of social. He walks back to the house (which is a 2 min walk away). I get a phone call from my mom who is still at the house, so I run back home. Jay broke beer bottles on my truck, made a Facebook post stating not to come to our social because even he isn't allowed in, proudly announced he was leaving all of us and took off drunk in a truck. Due to that FB post not many people came, but luckily he never made an appearance. Shitty enough, we had to spend the social telling all of our friends and family that Jay is no longer in the picture. That was only the beginning. I will summarize the next 3 months as best I can. 

\- 2 days later he told R that he tried to screw some chick but couldn't get it up. 

\- 2 weeks later he locked himself in the shop, got drunk, literally screwed all doors shut, called everyone on his contact list saying goodbye he was going to kill himself. Cops arrived, and he charged at them with a machete and got detained on a 48 hour psych. evaluation. The cops came to the house, asked if my mother and I wanted to pull is firearms license, and we both said yes in a heartbeat. They gave us their personal numbers incase he showed back up. We live in a remote area where it takes 30 min for any police car to arrive. 

\- 7 days later he apologized to all of us (which is something he has never done before) and wanted to work through everything. We reluctantly agreed, but he had to see a therapist. He agreed, good. 

\- My mom did not want him moving in so R and I allowed Jay to stay at our condo until he found a place. 

\- Convinced all of us that the therapist he was seeing was a pimp, so he no longer went. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things were better than they ever been. He accepted what he did was wrong, apologized and we thought he meant it. The wedding rolls around and it is a beautiful day. He chose songs to slow dance with my mom, kept saying how excited he was for our future together, and was very pleasant to be around. The day after the wedding we receive a call from my mom asking if Jay was with us. We told her no and asked way. He used R and I as an alibi to cover up that he was with another woman (F24). He calls saying he is done with mom and doesn't want a family. A complete 180. 

\- Kicks my mom and kid sister out of the house, so they come live with us for a couple weeks until we get the shop situated for my mom and sister. 

\- Constantly sends us all texts about how shitty we are, and how happy he is without us. 

\- Emails paragraphs to my mother degrading her and their marriage - EVERY DAY FOR ALMOST A YEAR.

\- Mom gets a no contact order and Jake wants to file for divorce. Good. 

\- Kicks Jay out, and he moves in with the 24 year old. 

\- Started rumours that my kid sister (14) was on drugs and pregnant. 

\- Refuses to pay child support and left my mom with all his bills and debt along with all her debt and the house and mills associated with that. 

\- Will not acknowledge that he hurt us, or did anything wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

That brings us up to now. I haven't spoken to him in 6 months. Every conversation we has turns into a pissing contest, or he talks shit about my sister, husband or mother. Every time I ignore him he goes on FB to write a slanderous post about us. Yet he claims his ""door is always open for his girls"".  His guilt trips almost work, but I don't want to let a man like that into my life. Am I wrong for not wanting him in my life?

So I was just sick of it and I told him we were over and that he should leave. He said there was no way he was leaving and that we’re gonna talk this out and we’re not breaking up. I threatened to leave if he wouldn’t and he said he wouldn’t give me his car keys. I asked him again to please leave and he said no. 

It was frustrating and annoying. I told him we are not dating anymore even if he was still there and he said “yes we are. We’re not breaking up right now”. It was making me even more angry how he was saying no. I didn’t even wanna talk to him and he was just there and wouldn’t go away. 

Then in the morning he was still fucking there. He said he was sorry about the fight and he wrote a list of all the things we have to talk about and work on. I told him that I broke up with him yesterday and he said he wasn’t accepting that and he loves me and we’re gonna try to fix this. I just went to work and he’s at home. 

He is fucking frustrating and annoying and I don’t even know if it’s worth it to try again. Like I’m sick of things not changing and it shouldn’t be this hard. Relationships should be easier, what’s the point of doing all that? I’ve just been thinking this over the whole day.

753,ca1xga,Throwaywayy345544,I 28(F) blew up on my bf (25M),"He's a good bit younger than me, he's also a little bit shorter than me and weaker. 
I like it for the most part but a lot of times I can't control myself when mad, since he can't do anything back I can't help but manhandle him when I get upset.
I've accidentally made a habit of pushing him if he frustrated me. And I have a problem about raising my voice, especially lately.
To make things worse he has a history of being abused, his biological dad (who divorced his mom when he was 10-12ish, I don't quite remember) used to hit him and yell at him and I sort of remember thinking when he told me that I wouldn't ever do the same, like I was gonna protect him or whatever. But he can be really frustrating, he always zones out when we're walking around and bumps into shit and sometimes he'll zone out when we're sitting there so if I wanna get his attention I can either repeat his name or raise my voice a bit. I think it's also worth mentioning that he has a habit of not wanting to leave places, like, if we got to visit a friend then he'll want to stay for hours even when I mentioned that it'd be a quick visit, which is made worse when you consider that if we go somewhere I want to go he'll want to leave, like I enjoy going to my friend's parties but he says that parties tire him out and he'll usually go outside and wait after just like 20 minutes or so of being there. 
He's also a very whiny person which can be nerve grinding. He, no joke, complained to me about his work for over an h o u r.
I know that isn't that bad or anything but in not usually that bad either, just saying that we both have flaws. 

The other day me and him got into an argument (which he did start) which resulted in us both getting heated. 
After a while I pushed him into the bed, which was wrong of me, and then he got back up and kept going. It was obvious that things had gotten too heated and that he should've stopped when I had but he kept saying stuff and eventually started yelling. 
 This was wrong of me but I was very upset so I pushed him back down and, again this wasn't right of me, punched him in the cheek. It wasn't too hard or anything but I really wanted the point across and while that wasn't the way to do it, I was very mad at the time. 
I know it's easy to say 'abuse abuse' but I only hit him once and it's harder than you think to not blow up sometimes after a long day and having someone that'd just sort of let you especially when they egg you on.

So please, keep judgements aside and just help me figure out a way to keep this relationship  going. He's been avoiding me and telling me that he's thinking about ending things and I can understand that he's still worked up. What are some ways to get forgiveness for something this serious?

To put my long story short, I'm a Freshmen in High School and I went to volunteer in a summer school and there I met a college male student who works there. Everyday when the kids that we tutor finish their classwork, he would come to sit by me and we would talk about school life and our favorite subjects etc... But recently, he's been bringing up topics like girlfriends and having feelings for someone. He told me he has a girlfriend who went to my dream college when he asked me about me dream college. He also told me a lot about his dreams of being able to work for google since he majors in comp. sci. Out of Jealously, I blurted out that I also had a Boyfriend when I actually don't. Then he started telling me how he had his first love when he was 14 and I lied that I had just began dating this year. He also showed me many pictures of him when he was on vacation and some of the prototypes he made for projects in school. During lunch breaks, he would ask me if I wanted to eat or if I would be hungry if i don't eat. To be honest, I had a feeling that he likes me, but I'm still doubt it because of the fact that he has a girlfriend already. I feel like we have a lot in common and we were always coincidently adding on to one another. For example, once I said that I would climb a ladder because I'm not afraid of height, he told me he was afraid of heights... I just wanted you guys' opinions on this.

I got a question for you guys. I'll try to make it quick. 

So I have been dating this girl for two years. We started dating my junior year in high-school. We ended up going to different colleges and we did long distance for my freshmen year. It was tough but it worked out and we are still dating to this day. Fortunately, we will be attending the same college next year... 

She goes out two or three times a week and goes to frat parties. She is not your typical party goer- she is very religious, a virgin (waiting until marriage), and only kisses and hooks up with guys after a while into a relationship. Long story short, I recently uncovered a video of her grinding on another guy at a frat party. Is this considered cheating? What should I do? Normally I would be 50/50, but considering how she is a ""good"" girl, I don't know what to think. Thoughts?",2019-07-07 02:28:21,9,1,relationship_advice
758,ca1w1q,shearlinggg,Can therapy change what could just be my (30f) boyfriend's (30m) personality?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for over 3 years and I'm starting to think that the below issues will be the end of us, but the last dangling hope I have is therapy. Does anyone have experience with any of the below that's been somewhat resolved with the help of individual or couples therapy? We both have solo appointments coming up in the next couple of weeks. 

1. Since the beginning we've had issues with our different levels of libido (mine being higher). I am the initiator 90% of the time and every monthish I tell him how this makes me feel. I've tried everything - a calm explanation of how this makes me feel, a frustrated argument, me crying about how unwanted I feel etc.  
2.  I plan 90% of our activities whether it's what we eat for dinner, what we do on a Saturday afternoon, where we go on vacation, etc. I like getting my way, but being the only one (most of the time) who plans our life together is draining me and isn't any fun after awhile. If it were up to him, he'd spend most of his time focusing on his own hobbies.
3. I am more social in group settings. I often find him on his phone or just plain not making an effort when we're at a gathering with friends. Neither of us know what's to blame here (social anxiety? nothing to talk about?).

Nothing seems to help with the above. He used to tell me he'd change, but lately it's been ""I don't know if I'll ever be able to"" or the more hopeful, ""I'm hoping therapy can help with this"". He can get really down on himself after I bring up the above points, because he knows it might end us, and he feels like he's not good enough (in life, not just with me). He's not the greatest at talking about his emotions (something else he hopes to work on) and so I'm left feeling uncomforted sometimes and/or like we didn't ""get to the bottom"" of anything. We've looked into whether he might be on the spectrum due to #2 and #3 above (and some other things), but neither of us are experts, obviously. 

&amp;#x200B;

He is very loyal, sweet and loving to me but it's starting to feel like that's just not enough and it breaks my heart. How much can therapy really change someone's personality?",2019-07-07 02:28:21,8,1,relationship_advice
759,c9zpcb,newtothistinderthing,"(24f) Dating a genuinely good guy, but I don't find him super attractive, and not sure what to do","So when it has come to dating guys, I haven't got the best track record

I have had situationships, and short term flings, with guys who are insanely (like, out of my league) hot. Things then tend to either die or change after sex, or they end up losing interest, or it turns out they were only using me for sex, or something. It hasn't been a lot of guys, and I have ended up getting hurt, but the mad chemistry and passion was there from the start. Until they started pulling away or texting less and it drove me crazy.

I've been on two dates with another guy. He is everything I'm not used to. He texts me every day, he takes me out on nice dates, he's consistent and lovely and he seems genuinely, really into me. He has even said so.

Two issues. Firstly, his keenness might be putting me off slightly, even though I was complaining about the others not texting me enough. He acts quite self conscious at times and seems to worry about what I think too much. But more so.... I'm not massively attracted to him.

Don't get me wrong, he's cute. But I've been with guys I found a lot more attractive. We have kissed and it was nice but I don't really get that feeling of wanting to rip his clothes off or thinking about him. It's more just a kind of nice, stable feeling.

I feel awful. It's such a superficial thing but its just I don't know how much of an issue it is. I just feel the chemistry isn't there. On top of that, the way he acted after we got together, like he won a prize or something, was a little off putting. He almost acts like I'm too good for him and I don't know. Should I give it a chance still?

\*\*tldr\*\* Dating a guy who is kind, attentive and really into me, completely different from the guys I have been dating. But I don't find him super hot and its causing an issue in my head.",2019-07-06 22:41:37,5,2,relationship_advice
760,ca1uwv,Blown_up_raptor,Need help getting through to my father.,"The info is elsewhere in my posts. Mom passed away a few years ago , my dad is getting remarried.  Im ok with that decision,  she's a good person. 
Anyway,  due to a job going out of business and taking the next best job money has been extremely tight.  
My dad, knowing my financial situation,  decided that I am in the wedding.  This requires at least a one night stay in a hotel,  buying a suit,  a dress for my wife,  and all the other expenses along with traveling.  
I currently don't see being able to afford the trip.  I do have a better paying job now,  but I told him my deadline to get a better job was June 1. I ended up starting July 1. Wedding is at end of the month,  and a three hour drive. 
I've told him I can't make the trip multiple times.  His typical response has been along the lines of,  ""let's see what happens."" 
Even after being directly told that I cannot make the trip,  he's still behaving as everything is normal and we're going to the wedding. 
What do I do to get my point across?",2019-07-07 02:24:50,2,0,relationship_advice
761,ca1ulr,RainbowIcee,Me [ 30M ] need advice on how to convince my wife [30F] to go on a diet or try it again? (long distance Relationship ),"The issue is more than just her weight but the habits and lifestyle that's just leading up to it it's worrisome for her, myself and the future of the relationship. We don't even have kids yet! we've been together for almost 9 years. She's finishing school so she doesn't work and it's currently on vacation ( lives in chile )

&amp;#x200B;

To bring in that last part of ""again"" into context, she did successfully lost a good deal of her weight she was proud and on a roll, I visited her for vacation and spoiled the whole thing with junk food and she hasn't gotten back on it and it's been over a year. It is entirely my fault, mostly because i'm more confident about losing my own weight when i do eat junk she just doesn't have the mentality for it and i'm not sure how to communicate it with her without her becoming extra sensitive on the fact that she's gaining the weight back and picking up bad lazy habits.

&amp;#x200B;

What i've tried: I myself went on a diet again, to lose 10lbs i just finished and told her i wanted to stay this way and talked to her that i from now on would stay away from junk and eat healthier. She mostly ignored it but does mention throw backs that ""you don't eat these things anymore "" every now and then so at least the intention stuck some what. But now i do want to communicate it to her directly. So atm i'm fit but i'm more than willing to tag along with her diet.

&amp;#x200B;

How much over weight she was and or is ? Well idk the numbers, but she was big. There's no sugar coating she was obese, even she after losing some of it was shocked at how large she was. She got to her tough last 20 lbs and that's when i ruined it. Now she's noticeably gaining lots of weight, her neck is almost gone again. She spends nearly all day in bed unless she needs to do something, she only sits to eat she literally goes to lay in bed if unoccupied and would easily spend 20 hours of day laying in bed when i'm not visiting.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i'm about to visit again in a week and the next day after i arrive we are going away to be alone for a week at a beach house that her friend will lend us so i want to talk to her soon before i go over so the elephant in the room would be sorted by then. Again i don't wanna wait till we're together because then the whole week would be spent poorly.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to handle the conversation so i'm asking for advice about it, she does get sensitive in fact i guarantee she will. I strongly feel we're too young to waste our lives on the couch as if we we're 70 and sick, personal experience with my own grandma tells me once you give in you're as good as dead on that life style, so there will be time for that stuck in a room for years when we're old and incapable of living actively.",2019-07-07 02:23:47,4,1,relationship_advice

We were together for 9 years, since I was 14. I always imagined that we would be together until the day we died, especially once we had a child and became a true family together. 

He struggles with addiction and mental illness and he decided to chose his vices over us. He was a complete stranger to me towards the end of the relationship, I had never been afraid of him until then. But. I still love him. I love him so fucking much and I know I shouldn’t because what he’s done to me but I can’t help it. I miss him so much that my heart aches, I cry myself to sleep 4-5x a week and just call out his name to hear it. My child and I have a protection order against him so we don’t have any contact but I so bad want to give him one last kiss, I miss all of him so much. I miss who he always was up until last year. 

I didn’t file for divorce because I don’t love him anymore, I did it to protect myself and our child, it feels like it’s 10 thousand times harder this way. I know he has the potential to be someone great but he refuses to let us see it. I just don’t know how to move on, how do I cope with loving someone who literally doesn’t exist anymore? How do I accept the fact that the person I thought was my true soulmate is gone?",2019-07-07 02:22:51,4,1,relationship_advice

Like he doesn’t want the bottom of my boob to be perky, he wants it to fall low. Lol. Idk what to do

765,ca1qeb,Alin1010,DOES HE LIKE ME?????????!!!!!!!!!!!!," For the viewers who are currently reading my post, I wanted to know if this boy likes me or not. To put my long story short, I'm a Freshmen in High School and I went to volunteer in a summer school and there I met a college male student who works there. Everyday when the kids that we tutor finish their classwork, he would come to sit by me and we would talk about school life and our favorite subjects etc... But recently, he's been bringing up topics like girlfriends and having feelings for someone. He told me he has a girlfriend who went to my dream college when he asked me about me dream college. He also told me a lot about his dreams of being able to work for google since he majors in comp. sci. Out of Jealously, I blurted out that I also had a Boyfriend when I actually don't. Then he started telling me how he had his first love when he was 14 and I lied that I had just began dating this year. He also showed me many pictures of him when he was on vacation and some of the prototypes he made for projects in school. During lunch breaks, he would ask me if I wanted to eat or if I would be hungry if i don't eat. To be honest, I had a feeling that he likes me, but I'm still doubt it because of the fact that he has a girlfriend already. I feel like we have a lot in common and we were always coincidently adding on to one another. For example, once I said that I would climb a ladder because I'm not afraid of height, he told me he was afraid of heights... I just wanted you guys' opinions on this. Do you think he would like me or not? If not, or if so, please explain. I genuinely want to know the answer. Thx for reading",2019-07-07 02:10:46,7,1,relationship_advice

We went to a pool party with a bunch of friends and she wanted to play chicken with her friend. Tbh I ate a whole bag of family size BBQ chips so my stomach was hurting and I wanted to sit out and I thought she just wouldn’t play either. And then this fucking guy who’s been on her ass for months is like “I’ll play with you if he doesn’t wanna!!!!!” She said ok and it made me sick. When she got on his shoulders, he fucking reached back and grabbed her ass “to make sure she wasn’t slipping”. He was holding her thighs and touching her and she was playing with his hair. He was dying for a crumb of her pussy and when she asked if she was heavy for him, he kept repeating that she’s so light and she feels like nothing. No shit, she’s 100 pounds my 10 yr old brother could pick her up and throw her around. 

I was pissed to be honest. Like why would she even say yes. Chicken is an intimate game, sitting on someones shoulders ? That’s like a sex position but backwards his face was so close to her pussy. It’s like a flirty game, you do it with your boyfriend or a guy ur gonna fuck. Afterwards I asked her to rub my tummy and then I quietly asked her to please not engage in that type of contact with other guys especially not this jackass who obviously likes her. She got upset and took what I was saying the wrong way and then she put her clothes on and sat on her phone and wouldn’t talk to me.

771,ca1mpj,deadblinger,I(F23) am struggling with finding out a bundle of lies from my boyfriend (23),"This might be a little long because idk how to spare any details in stories.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend(M29) and I(F23) have been together for almost 11 months. He was a tinder hookup that turned into a casual fling, then progressed because I got pregnant a month after meeting each other. I found out I was pregnant because I was in a car crash and went to the hospital. After I came home and told him, we decided to keep the baby (honestly i just said i wasn't going to get an abortion and said we could just break up because i was more than happy doing things on my own, but he decided he'd rather have a kid with someone he just met than break up so i guess that's just how it went). Things worked out for the most part, two months later we decided to move to his parents in Colorado (we lived in Virginia), so we packed up and drove there. I don't have any family and he comes from a pretty tight nit one and if we were gonna raise our first baby we wanted some major help. 

I ended up giving birth at 17 weeks after our daughter unexpectedly passed away in the womb. We were extremely grief stricken and when I say we literally spent every second of every day together for the next 4 months, I mean it 100%. I didn't even take a shit alone. But it was what we needed. Obviously spending every day together we've really gotten super close.

But lately, all we do is argue. It's been like this for two months. I'm extremely depressed. Before I met my boyfriend, I came up out of a really abusive life, in and out of foster cares and growing up and being around really bad situations. I worked hard, moved across the country and made a good life for myself. I got a really really good job in Insurance, got my own car and house and was living fine. I felt really proud of myself for making something of my life even if I was in a place with virtually no family or friends- at least I was stable. 

Since the loss of our child, I am extremely depressed. I've gained an obscene amount of weight, I have been out of work for months and I just can't seem to find anything. I've bombed so many interviews, I think I did good and would get the job but they never call back. I have developed the inability to make eye contact with people when I talk and I stutter really badly. I try my best to work on it, but I guess it's a bigger problem than I imagined. 

We moved back to Virginia after my estranged father offered him a job. It pays okay. When we moved back for the first moth or so we were couch hopping while we were trying to find another apartment, because the place we had fell through. I gave my boyfriend the money I had before we left from selling my car after I got into the wreck, and he ""put it in savings"". (I didn't get into a wreck in my car, I was a passenger in the front seat of my cousins car. I sold my own car because I became to anxious to drive. I ended up paying my unemployed cousin to drive me to and from work, so it didn't harm me in anyway and just gave me extra money.)

&amp;#x200B;

I found us an apartment and continued to look for jobs in the area. Now that we are a 1 car household and he works 2 hours away, it's hard finding something I can walk too. Our rent and deposit was 1k each and the landlord said we could pay the deposit over 4 months. I told my boyfriend we could use the money I had given him that he put in the bank for the first months rent and he could pay the 250 deposit. I was determined that I could find a job and pay my half the next month. I figured this was fair because while I'm unemployed I still paid the first months.

He was already shady about the money and I have a good feeling he spent the money and never put it in the bank in the first place. I would ask him to pull it out so we could pay the rent and he drove to the bank and then texted me saying he couldn't get it out because the bank teller that handles accounts for people who don't have cards with them (the bank) wasn't there. It's a military bank and he has a savings account there and doesn't have a debit card so I know that's a good lie. I know that he also probably actually drove to the bank because we have an app that shows each other where we are and he's smart enough to know that I would look. Which I did. Because I'm smart.

&amp;#x200B;

He said that he would just pay the rent with what's in his bank account. He get's paid 500+ every week, so it's also believable to think he would have that money, it's just stupid to think he would do it. Why take everything you have leaving us and yourself with no money knowing we have no food in the house we just got and you need to be able to afford the long drive everyday to work and back. Whatttever, I let it go.

&amp;#x200B;

(Sorry this is long) Just now, he asked me to check his phone to see what his friend texted him and I opened up his text thread from him and his father. He was begging for some money because he was short on rent. Why wouldn't you just schedule a time to meet with the bank LIKE I SAID, and get out what we have? PROBABLY BECAUSE ITS NOT IN THERE.

&amp;#x200B;

I try my best to manage our money, even when we were living off of my savings and even before when I still had a job while pregnant and he didn't. He blows through shit and makes the most irresponsible decisions no matter what I say.

&amp;#x200B;

I will preface this with the following: he's a damn good partner. He's sweet, NEVER abandoned me, ALWAYS made solutions to problems, ALWAYS is damn near perfect person to be in a relationship and is sweet and caring and trusthworthy. But the irresponsibility with him as a man thats also amost 30 years old.. I just feel like it's too much. I find myself stooping to his ignorant ways of living life and it's hard on me as a person. He really is so nurturing and beautiful to live life with. And if he could be a stay at home dad and worry about raising a child and keeping a home- he'd be perfect. 

&amp;#x200B;

If he really did spend the money I gave him that's a huge lie to uphold for almost a year, and I can't deal with it. 

I don't want to bring it up and accuse him if I'm actually wrong... but deep down I know I'm not. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry this was so long but it's a problem of lies among many, even though aside from monetary issues he is a GREAT person. He really does do the most for me and really does take the blunt of problems and make things work in the end but at what cost? 

Is it sefish of me to sit back and play blind at a man who tries to give me everything while hiding what he doesn't have and lives recklessly to try to make me happy? I don't need money, I need stability. I would gladly eat microwaved potatoes and not have everything I wish for as long as my bills were paid and I had him at the end of the day. 

Just don't know how to really tell him that especially because he's so different from me and wants the finer things in life.

So I've been together with her about 1 year. I met her through some friends and she seemed so nice and sweet. I was her friend for 1 year. I started to get some feelings for her. So I decided to ask her out. Turns out she had feelings for me. You know in the beginning the relationship was promising. And then we started to argue a little. I always tried to make stuff work while she didn't care at all. She wouldn't event try. Then we started to fight a lot. And i knew I should have broken up but I couldn't, it was scary. I just don't know why but I was scared. One day I told her in the nicest way I could that we maybe should break up and that I felt like she wasn't trying and I didn't feel good in that relationship. And she flipped out, straight up she started screaming and telling me to kill myself and that I didn't deserve her and then BOOM! she slapped me and I actually don't remember the rest. I was in my bed and thinking where I did wrong but I don't know. And at that point I wasn't sure if I still love her. I did everything in my ability to make her happy. And a month after she broke up with me. And after like 3 hours she came back to me and told me she wanted to be my GF again. I didn't know what to say. And me being so dumb said ""Sure"". And nothing has gotten better she often swears at me and tells me I should die. I k how I should break up but I can't build up the courage to break up with her.

773,ca1kvx,TigerMercury,Should I contact her?,"Hi all,

So I was just the hospital for a stomach virus, and while I was there, I met a nurse.  At first I thought she was pretty, but nothing more.  I tend to put up emotional walls to prevent myself from getting hurt or too taken by someone early on.  It was simple.  She was pretty.  

Then later on, when she would come in to check how I was doing, we struck up conversation.  I have celiac disease, and it turns out so does she, so we started joking about that and talking about our struggles and finds with the diet.  So after about... no joke, 30 minutes of talking (it was a slow night in her unit), it seemed like we hit it off.  Once the conversation ended, she went back to her job and would come in occasionally as needed.   I know it's silly, but this girl was special.  From my room, I could just hear by how she was talking to and taking care of the patients in my hall that she was a very compassionate individual (as many nurses are), she was very personal, and seemed to have a way of just brightening up the rooms she entered.  I was honestly enamored.  I was pretty down when her shift ended and the next nurse (who was very nice, good at her job, and also beautiful) came in.  She was great, but I just didn't feel the connection I felt with the earlier nurse.  Again, I'm not the type to get taken with women... I try to keep things professional.  That's what let me know it wasn't just me being a silly hopeless romantic, but that I actually felt a connection with this person.  It was clear to me that this girl was special.  She was around my age, and I was very sad that our paths may never cross again (the hospital is 45 min to an hour away).

So to make a long story short (too late), here I am quite a bit later, and I'm unable to get this individual out of my mind.  

To make things weirder, my grandma recently passed away, and I'm almost wondering if she orchestrated this whole meeting.  I know that sounds overly superstitious, but when I was in the hospital, my grandma went into hospice care qnd was unresponsive.  She passed shortly after I checked out of the hospital.  I was devastated that I couldn't be there for her, but my sickness was strangely abrupt.  It almost seems like something she'd do to get me to meet someone... she knows I'm an introvert, she knows I'm looking for a serious relationship, and she's asked me before if I had a girlfriend (to which she's bummed when I say no).  I'm sure I'm being a bit delusional with this last bit about my grandma lol.  I just thought the timing was strange, and it made me wonder.

So anyway, getting back to this nurse: what should I do fellow redditors?  Should I attempt to write to her, telling her I'd like to get to know her better?  Should I contact her saying something else?  Or should I just let it pass, and leave it to fate (this option is realistically going to result in me never hearing from her again)?  Do I have anything to lose by reaching out?  I don't want to come across as creepy, and I thought it would have been unprofessional and disrespectful to ask her in the middle of her work shift.  This has been eating at me, and I am not sure what to do.   What do you all think?",2019-07-07 01:54:05,3,1,relationship_advice
774,ca1ji6,Verdis172,I (M17) feel like she (F17) likes me more that just a friend from school.,"Before i start, i still don't if I'm doing a right thing posting my story here. I don't know why

I'm currently 17 (M), soon to hit 18. Yet to start third year of high school(more like technical school, but it's kinda the same when it comes to duration) (summer break). My class have only one girl, and actually i really like her. Currently we are driving same train to and from the school practice (it's like a job that school prepared to you to learn something at the work). I feel very comfortable with her, surprisingly because it's hard for me to make contact with any girl. I'm talking about that level of comfort that we are watching some memes, telling stories, etc. Today i was at cinema with her, and one more friend (we were supposed to have 6 people cinema trip but it clearly didn't worked as we planned.) It almost could look like an 2 person trip, me and she, but that didn't happen. After the movie the other friend had to go faster for his train, we had to wait about an hour, so we decided to walk around some stores and watch for some fun and weird stuff. And then it started. I was feeling very weird, because it was actually first time we were at some other place than a train. I was kinda stressed about whole situation. I mostly cared about if it isn't weird for her to walk with me somewhere. We then went to the train station. Normally we walk with our own pace, but this time she walked with mine pace. (Ok maybe im over exaggerating about that fact, sorry about that). We still had like 20 minutes until the train arrive, so we decided to sit at the bench, but it was wet after rain. I used my jacket to sit on it. She joined me without any question. And then i started feeling even more weird, i can compare that to an butterflies in the stomach (i think you know what i mean). I felt like i should ask if she likes me more like a friend from class, but my cockiness won against me and i didn't asked her about that. Basically i was near dead silent for the whole 20 minutes. (Maybe even more silent that her). We entered the train and after some time i did a weird think. I did something like a ""finger spider walk"" movement from my leg to her leg. She looked at me and laughed (didn't said what was that). I immediately realized what i did and said sorry about that, and for the rest of the ride i was silent. (Of course i said goodbye and wished a good weekend).

 And it comes to here that i don't know how to fell about that and what should I do. Like I really want to ask her but im too cocky to ask about that. I don't even know if she would accept me. To be honest i don't even know if she behaved like that before. We only know each other for two years(and for me it's not a long amount of time, i think). 

She soon have her 18th birthday, one day before my birthday. Of course i will be attending her birthday. She even asked me if i will be at her birthday day, and she responded with ""I also hope so"". Maybe that was a first hint from her, which maybe she thinks I didn't realized, but i did?

What should i do in this situation? Shall i wait with asking her, look at her behavior, or just fuck it and ask her straight about that at next time we gonna see each other?(this would be that Monday)",2019-07-07 01:49:47,0,1,relationship_advice

776,c9z85g,A_Tamas,Agressive Grandfather,"Hey guys, first of all I'd like to intruduce myself, I'm Tamás I live in Hungary, currently I'm 17 years old. So, first of all, I have a girlfriend for almost two years now, we're happy together, she is 18, but that doesn't really matter. The problem isn't her, it is my grandfather. Basically the back story is that I live with my grandfather, my grandmother and my father, sadly my mother passed away in 2003. I got to know my girlfriend online, in 2017, we started to talk and fell in love. Their parents were very strict, we live 200 kms away from each other, but we manage to meet almost every week. Distance is also not a problem. Her strict parents let us meet whenever we wanted since the september of 2018. By the way we got together on the first of October, 2017. Everything started to look great for us, we could meet whenever we wanted, we were really really happy. In the middle of June, she came for 4 days, we had fun, it was all good. In the second day, my aunt came to ""help us"", because my grandmother is in hospital. Me and my girlfriend knew well that if she sees us, she is going to make a scene, so we decided to visit the bigger city, which is like 25 kms away. But we were late, she arrived as soon as we wanted to go, she then asked my girlfriend who is her in a very rude way, then asked her why is she here, she continued on being an asshole, I protected my girlfriend then I told her to stop. My girlfriend was fully on tears, I tried to calm her down. Later, when I calmed her down, I went back, to get my aunt, and make her apologize for the things she said. You have to know that I'm not agressive, I'm really patient, even when people hurting me, I always choose the smartest way to make something work, not the agressive way. So, I told her in bad words to come out or I'll make a problem for her, I'm not gonna write what I basically said. She apologized from her, but she told my grandfather what happened, and my grandfather didn't really like my girlfriend, my girlfriend is chubby, and that is his problem, thats why he hates her. He told me a couple times ago she can't come, he hates her, but he knows nothing about her. They didn't even speak one word, and my grandfather doesn't want to. I didn't tell my girlfriend that, because if she'd knew that, she wouldn't come, and we couldn't meet (we can't go to her parents), because if my grandfather would change his mind, she wouldn't come. So, I'm trying to convince my grandfather to let her come, and he gone really agressive. I wasn't shouting, I wasn't agressive, I sat in front of him, I asked him why, he then went out and locked me into his room. I'm not a small guy, I played ice hockey for many years, I started to bang on the door to let me out, he finally did. We can't talk about that, because he just says no, and that's it, we couldn't talk normally, he isn't listening to me, and it seems my dad isn't helping me, but he loves my girlfriend, and my grandma does too, she tries to help but she couldn't really. I feel that when everything is on top, and everything is fine, something smashes it down, and I have to build it from scratch. I'm not depressed, I just feel helpless, and I don't know how to convince him, when I try to talk about that he turns agressive, he said if I bring her here, he is going to beat her, ofcourse I told him that I won't let that. He raised me, I love him, but he isn't the grandfather who he was 10 years ago. I just don't know what should I do know.

He has these mood swings where he’ll be sweet and wanna talk about anything, then next he’ll be incredibly horny and then next he’ll be super jealous and he’ll just shut me out because of it. He gets jealous when I’m with family or friends. For some examples, I went to the beach with a guy friend and I jokingly said “omg my friend picked me up by my boobs he’s such a jerk” then my date replied, “oh? Am I interrupting a hot date? I’ll just leave you be.” Then afterwards I felt bad so I apologized and then he had a mood swing and said “you’re the best.” 

Another example, tonight I went to the bar with my parents and I took a picture of my drink and sent it to him, my dad’s hand was in the photo a little, he replied,
“Why are you drinking? Who are you drinking with? I didn’t know you were going to a bar.” 

2 minutes later he replied again “I’m gonna go.”I just told him to chill out because it’s my parents but he still hasn’t responded. This doesn’t feel right to me I know this isn’t normal.",2019-07-07 01:37:26,11,1,relationship_advice
780,ca1dtg,PicklesPug,"I'm(20f) disowning my uncle(39m) after recent behavior the last couple of years, is this plan effective or should I rework it?","My uncle and I used to be extremely close. We'd play videogames together, watch TV together, camped outside, jumped on the trampoline with my brother, etc. 

It sucks that it's come down to this. This will be a LONG history of my uncles spiraling behavior, I apologize in advance for the long read. 

My uncle was a cool guy before his son was born, after his son was born and him and his now ex girlfriend had a house together, she cheated. Left my uncle in massive amounts of debt. a drawn outcustody battle, arguing between families And, with an unknowingly(at the time) autistic child. 

My uncle has never been a great parent, lack of discipline then no real affection to his son.
He focuses more on dating and his sex life it seems. 

He usually pawns my cousin off to my grandma which she adores all of us and we've never not felt loved or adored by her. 

My uncle is usually wrapped in a videogame, or sleeping. Which, when he had an excellent paying third shift job was awesome because he had way more money and was happy. 

Just he wasn't typically up and around which admittedly sucked. He met Heather who he loved and adored and was planning to marry. 

All this lack of attention to his son starting making him act out horribly. It also didnt help that he was unknowingly autistic and now is severely behind socially. 

Heather couldn't handle his son, so she respectfully ended things. Around this point my uncle was severely depressed, and turned to popping painkillers. He even stole mine and my mom's when we had severe ankle injuries. 

He now frequently asks my grandma for her chronic pain medication as her knees are severely arthritic and she can't afford a replacement. 

He got married a few years ago, this woman hates his son, So obviously plays favorites to her son and made my uncle quit his well paying job. Now he begs everyone for money. 

He could potentially have money saved, if he would be smart with his money. When he has a new obsession he spends WAY too much money on it. 

His wife is headed for a divorce, fast. I hate seeing everything crumple. But, I understand. My uncle is always checking out other women, whether on Tiktok, public, or his wife's friends/sister. And, it's obvious. 

He's potentially a predator, as I've posted previously. I'm tired of mentioning a new  friend I've made and the first response being ""Is she hot?"" I usually answer ""Aren't you married?"" 

I hate showing him a show or game I like and the first response is always about how hot someone is. Then he finds cosplays of them on TikTok to show me. I don't care about some girl dressing up. 

This spiral my uncle is on isn't one I wish to be part of anymore. I plan to just cut contact, avoid, but, I also want him to be aware of my feelings.

That being said, I don't even know what to say or where to begin. 

I've never fully cut someone out of my life that was family, here's to hoping this goes well. Any comments or advice are greatly appreciated! 



TL;DR Planning on cutting my uncle out of my life after watching his life down spiral for years. I feel like he doesn't see the issues and won't fix them. So, it's time to cut ties. He isn't the same uncle I grew up with and loved.

Any advice of cutting him out, while also help with expressing my feelings is greatly appreciated and welcomed!",2019-07-07 01:32:39,0,1,relationship_advice

782,ca1cid,kws4e,GF is meeting a guy from Lovoo,"So long story short: My girlfriend and me broke up about two weeks ago, because we had quite a difficult time with each other. But we realised that we still want the relationship so we are a couple agian. We both downloaded Lovoo and apps like that right after our brake up because we both don't know too many friends and we both were looking for some people to talk to. I was never interested in dating a new woman that early and she said the same thing about the guys from these dating platforms. 
Last week, 7 days after our brake up she met that one guy in person, they were eating ice cream and stuff. She realised that dating a new guy that quickly isn't her thing so after that meeting she wrote him that she likes him, but isn't in for a realationship right now and that she would be happy to stay friends. He is quite a fuckboy if you ask me, with shirtless pictures on Lovoo, bragging about how many womans he already had and stuff like that right after the beginning of the chat. So he kept on hitting on her, but I'm not mad because at that point he didn't knew what was still going on between me and her in terms of feelings. So now he knows that she still is into her ex (me) but he doesn't know that we are a couple again as far as I know. Tomorrow they have planned to meet each other at a coffee in the evening or something. I clearly told her that I'm not feeling well with that situation, because I really don't see why she tries that hard to be freinds with him. I think that I can really trust her, but it is obvious that he is still into her and I'm also doubting his plans of being only freinds. I don't get why it needs to be him, the Fuckboy from Lovoo who clearly wants to get more from her. I mean she could be friends with guys from work, friends of friends or some stuff, I don't know. But guys from Lovoo? 
Am I the one who is overthinking the situation? 

I mean why would she get back into a realationship with me after quite a hard time if she doesn't really like me? But on the other hand I'm asking myself why she needs him as a friend, she only met him once, I mean since when do you ""date"" new friends? Feels weird to me. And the fact that he kind of seems to be a little bit in love with her makes everything even worse. He doesn't write her like a friend does. The first thing after waking up for him is writing her. The last thing after going to sleep is writing her. He tells her how important she is to him and stuff like that ... 

Sorry for the bad english, I just need some thoughts about the situation, maybe I am the weird one. I'm a jealous person in relationships so that situation right now is really testing my limits.",2019-07-07 01:28:38,13,1,relationship_advice

784,c9uf9e,nellfromthemovienell,I (29M) am having some complicated feelings towards my former best friend (30M) and need some advice.,"Sorry for the length, this is a long one!

Just some backstory:

Me and my former best friend met in middle school when we were both about 8years old. We were best friends almost instantly and did everything together. We hung out after school pretty much every day, hung out all weekend together and were basically inseparable in school.  I started to realize I was gay when I was 14 and he was the first person I came out to. I was extremely nervous about telling him but he took it really well and we continued as friends with no change. A few months later, he approached me and told me that he had some gay thoughts from time to time and that he wanted to explore things if I wanted to. I had developed a crush on him, and I happily agreed. This carried on for over a year, until we were 16 when he ended things with me. We had kept everything a secret from our friends and families and I had told him that I wanted to come out to some close friends, but he was not ready and was worried people would figure things out. I guess my requests to come out grew tiresome and he was growing frustrated and ended things with me. This crushed me and I had developed very strong feelings for him. I told him I needed some time apart although he asked me to continue as friends so people again wouldn’t think something was up. I found it too difficult to hang around him and one day told him that I was planning on coming out to some of our friends and he immediately got defensive and angry. I got drunk at a party that night and came out to everyone there but said nothing regarding our relationship. However, like he thought, people began to piece together what had happened and why there had been some distance between us lately and he completely shut me out of his life altogether. He distanced himself from our mutual friends group and for our final year of high school I barely spoke or saw him. He moved away for university and we never really spoke again. I was crushed and after my initial anger subsided, I wanted to reach out but never did.

Present day

Last summer, I was back in my hometown for a wedding. I was bumming around town the day before the wedding and who do I walk straight into? My former best friend who I haven’t seen at all in over 10 years. He had moved across the country and no one I was close with had heard much of anything from him in years. He mentioned he was also in town that weekend for a wedding.  We ended up chatting for over an hour on the street corner, and it seriously felt like the most natural conversation I’ve ever had. I asked if he wanted to meet up before he had to fly back and he agreed. We had lunch the day after our weddings and it was great. We just talked and talked for hours until he realized he had to head to the airport. He hugged me before leaving and in that moment I realized that I had really regretted not reaching out to him earlier and that I had really missed him. After he left, I burst into tears and felt sick to my stomach. 

A couple months later I was out with some friends in my city in a neighbourhood I don’t usually hang out in. As we are walking to a bar, I once again literally ran right into the same friend again. He was in town for a job interview and decided to stay an extra night and check out the city. This was pure happenstance and I couldn’t believe that we had randomly crossed paths yet again. We ended up chatting for a few minutes before I had to catch up to my friends, but he did not seem confident in his job interview. I wished him well before heading out and again we had a long hug before departing.

Fast forward a few months and he informs me he is moving to my city, that he got the job and is excited to be back. I congratulate him, but we make no official plans to hang out. Randomly, yet again we crossed paths while I was out on a work meeting in an area that I never frequent on the day he first moved back. At the point it just feels like we run into each other any time he is town. We joke and say we need to plan something but my shyness works against me and I never actually plan anything.

During all this time I am realizing that I have missed our friendship so much. This was my best friend for so long and then it was like he disappeared out of my life. I didn’t have any romantic feelings towards him, but I realized that I have never really had a male friendship that had the bond we had, including in my serious relationships. I decided to bite the bullet and ask him to do something. In these past ten years, he has unofficially come out of the closet as well, and has had boyfriends but isn’t out to his family. But in all of our conversations he has never actually told me about his personal life at all or discussed any of our shared past, we’ve always just talked about our jobs and our general lives, I just know the boyfriend thing through Instagram.

For some reason I asked if he would like to join me on a hike. He agreed and we planned one together, but ended up getting rained out. We rescheduled, and again got rained out. Third time it happened again. But finally one sunny day was approaching and I asked if he was free. He said he was and we actually went on a hike together. I had a blast and he seemed to be having a good time as well. The hike ended up taking over 9 hours with drive times, which we haven’t spent that much time together since we were teenagers.  But again, our conversations were pretty much just surface level, I talked a little bit about my past relationships but he wouldn’t divulge any information. I didn’t push him at all but he again said nothing in regards to being gay.

After he dropped me off after the hike, I asked if he wanted to go grab a beer at the nearby bar but he insisted that he was too tired and needed to shower. He got out of his truck to say goodbye to me, giving me a brief hug before taking off. And ever since then, I haven’t heard a word from him. I sent him a picture I took of him on my phone (that he asked me to take) and he never responded and now it’s been several weeks and its just been radio silence. I was all excited afterwards because again, it just seemed like reacquainting with an old friend. And now I just feel awkward. I kind of want to reach out and tell him that I really miss him, as a friend and that I would love to hang out again if he’s open to it, but I don’t want to scare him away. At this point I now feel more awkward than asking people out on dates and I don’t know how to approach this casually. So I guess I am looking for advice on how to basically again reconnect with my former best friend and how I should go around telling him how much I missed our friendship? Any tips?",2019-07-06 14:53:25,2,7,relationship_advice
785,c9z1yq,needadvice7619,[22M] I slept over at my GF's [22F] house and had morning sex which she doesn't remember because of sleeping medication. She now thinks I took advantage of her and broke up with me,"I have my first ever counselling appointment in a week and I don't think I can hold this all in so I really had to share this to get some input from you guys.

&amp;#x200B;

I've known her for 2.5+ years and we were together for \~8 months. About a month ago I had my birthday and I had come over to her house to spend some time together, to which I was really looking forward to because she's been really busy and we don't get to see each other face to face often. At some point she handed me her present for me and it was a really well thought out present but the price tag was much higher than what I would want anyone to spend on me. Because I'm an absolute moron, I tried to thank her for the present and convince her to return it so she could use the money on herself or use it for something we could both enjoy. Yes, I'm an idiot. It wasn't much of an argument, and more of me just backpedaling the conversation because I realized how big of an ass I am and how hurt she was because of me. She was upset and wanted me to go home and take the present home with me. We continued our conversation though, and in the end she just spilled her heart out about why she got the present and we shared some tears, hugged, and made up. All was good at this point.

It was about 1 a.m. so I asked her if I could stay over since it was late. She said yeah and told me to wait in bed for her while she got herself ready for sleep. She looked kinda tired while she walked around the room even stumbling into her sock drawer at some point, but I didn't suspect anything out of the ordinary because she's a klutz and broke a toe several times. When she got in bed we just cuddled and this eventually turned into a light make out session and fingering. We eventually stopped and finally got some shut eye.

Fast-forward to the morning after, we were spooning and her pressing up against me and grinding had woken me up. She took my hand and guided me over her body. Fooled around some more until I stopped and asked her if she wanted 'some more', to which she muttered 'mhm'. We started having penetration and everything was just the same as always, her eyes and facial expressions were not throwing me any red flags because she had been whispering to me and had her eyes open. She goes sort of limp for about 10 seconds and at this point I realize something is off because she's not answering me coherently. I stop and she eventually comes to and doesn't freak out or anything but there's definitely an expression of severe discomfort on her face. I start asking her if she's okay and she's unresponsive to my questions. At this point I'm panicking because I don't know what's going on and why she is acting so differently. She starts getting ready for work and I'm just left alone trying to figure things out. Before we both leave through the front door, I try to question her about what had just happened but she really didn't want to talk about it.

For the rest of the day I'm drowning in anxiety and stress from the situation, and I come to the conclusion that she may have had a really bad flashback which weren't uncommon. She's a rape victim and this was something that we have been working through together. During intercourse she would sometimes tense up and she would just ball up, I always tried to be sensitive about what she was going through and would give her space and tried to not make her feel like she was less of a person because of her panic attacks. My conclusion gave me some relief because my mind had created a dozen of worst case scenarios.

I think about two days pass until she finally tells me that she doesn't remember anything from the night before or how the morning sex had started. I ask her about certain things she may or not remember to figure out exactly how much she had forgotten. In this conversation I learn that she had taken some sleeping medication, and it wasn't melatonin like she took sometimes but some sleeping medication that her mother had shared with her. She had taken it previously on a few occasions and I always complained that she should stop taking it because the dose was more than she could handle and it could affect her morning drive to work. I didn't know that she took it that night or any other sleep aid. I'm upset with the current situation because I could have never saw it coming and I'm afraid that this just caused her more trauma given her history.

In the coming month she tries really hard not to talk about it with me and instead just distances herself away. I know how bad it can be to stall such serious conversations that must be had, so I'm constantly trying to check in about it but I get nothing out of her. After days of anxiety from the uncertainty of what was going on in her head we finally had our talk and she broke up with me over what happened because she can't get passed it.

She says she doesn't trust me anymore and I don't know how to interpret that because I've always been honest and never raised my hand against her so I just don't see where this is coming from. I didn't know she was impaired by medication, and I explained it numerous times but she still insists that she doesn't trust me. I feel almost betrayed by the fact that the integrity of my character means so little to her in this case. From what she has said so far, she isn't certain if what I did was on purpose or not. I can't understand why she would think I would take advantage of her given the fact of how much effort and sacrifices I've put into dealing with her condition. I don't know if she considers the sleeping medication that she had taken as a factor in what had happened.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seriously torn apart about this. I offered to pay for a counselling session for her but she has adamantly refused professional help, she insists that she is working out her problems on her own and that it works.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I possibly do in this situation, should I just give up hope and quit trying to mend this out? I'm very much still in love with her, and she insists that she still loves me but she can't love me romantically after what had happened. Is it hopeless for me to expect that this will just take time to heal and things can go back on track for us? She never said that I raped her, she never put a label on the incident but refers to it as 'what happened then'.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Just to clarify, she made it clear that she can still be around me and be friends. And despite her sexual trauma, our sex life was pretty active and healthy considering the circumstances.",2019-07-06 21:40:23,8,2,relationship_advice
786,c9t114,I_Like_My_Green_Hat,"I[25M] found out my best friend [24M] is a rapist, and I told his girlfriend[22F] who I am in love with","Long post. Context about best friend. He was beaten nearly to death as a child and teenager by his father, as well as sexually abused. Earlier in the week his girlfriend and I were talking about past relationships and she said if something is weird with the person she is dating she would need her friends to tell her. 

Okay so I was hanging out with friends and there were funny stories being shared. My best friend started telling a story about how when he was drinking he went to a party with his girlfriend at the time and his ex girlfriend was there. He said she got drunk and passed out in a room, and he went in there and fucked her. I said I'm pretty sure that's rape. He laughed and said that she woke up and wasn't fighting it. He said the best part was that her boyfriend was downstairs. I was disgusted and wanted to throw up. I told him never tell that story again. 
The group of people 4 of us total left that night and I texted my friend who was there and talked with her about it. I sought help from many people deciding what to do. I felt completely guilty about the whole situation, because I knew it would ruin their relationship. He's sober now and has turned his life around and is a kind and caring person, but can also be mean and manipulative. His girlfriend didn't believe me at first and asked me to double check, because she said it doesn't sound like him at all. 

I talked with him last night and told him what he said gravely affected me and someone else there who was a rape survivor. He got upset that I didn't tell him right away that he said something horrible. I told him I couldn't face him right away because it was too difficult. I went over the story again with him, and the fact remained the same that he had sex with his ex girlfriend who was passed out. He said it wasn't how it sounded at all. He said he explained it wrong. He said she was flirting with him all night. He said she wanted him. But did not deny the fact that he had sex with her when she was passed out. I told his girlfriend almost everything that he said, some parts I left out because they were too visual. That was about an hour ago. I just want to throw up I feel so sick. I haven't slept right since i found out my friend is a rapist. Please any advice or anything is helpful. I don't know what to think right now.",2019-07-06 12:23:52,25,12,relationship_advice

788,ca1aw5,TheOneOtherAccount,I [17M] am wondering if it’s normal for relationships to get slow physically after a while with my girlfriend [16F],"Throwaway because she knows I use reddit, but I don’t know if she uses it too.

Some backstory is that  we’ve been together for more than 3 years now in an official relationship. I know it’s longer than most others around my age, but we both are in our first actual relationship and are still figuring things out. I’ve done everything by myself up to this point but now I need to ask. But now I guess since I’ve given this information along with our ages, it’s pretty easy to figure out who we are. We’ve always have had a very happy relationship throughout the years but now every time I see her and it seems like I don’t get a ton of attention, I feel empty.

For the past times we’ve hung out stretching as far as 5 months ago (maybe even farther, I cant remember well), I’ve noticed a decrease in different things which we would always do. We would make out multiple times in a day, but then it dropped off to maybe once in her car before one of us left, not during the time we’re over at a house, and now it’s just a few kisses here and there, a few before we get out of the car, and that’s it. Another thing I’ve noticed is that the snuggling feels less intimate, like she’s less willing to snuggle in a way we don’t normally and she kinda makes a displeased noise when I try and shift around. Today when we were together, she just kinda stopped being close altogether with the only contact being her foot on my knee while she was on Snapchat which just left me to watching Netflix by myself for an episode and a half. Is it normal for this to start happening later in a relationship?

I don’t know, I’m just more and more sad every time I leave her place or she goes home and it seems like we’ve done less. It got bad today after she dropped me off so I resulted into typing this. Some more information that you all may want to hear is that we’ve never had sex or any sexual contact like that except that I would rest my hand on her butt while we were snuggling, which she’s told me she likes it, but there’s not much of an opportunity for that to happen anymore. And I understand, I am not entitled to sexual acts and I don’t want to do it unless she would want to also, but we’re only in high school so that’s not an expectation of me. I guess another factor is that she’s never really initiated much besides kissing me on the cheek. Other than that, I always have to be the one to hug her or fully kiss her.

Any advice? Thanks. I’m just trying to figure these things out.",2019-07-07 01:23:33,10,1,relationship_advice

790,ca18ns,hipipoh,"After fighting, SO treats me like i dont exist, and i push for attention","When in an argument, my (F27) SO (M37) does not want to discuss stuff. He wants peace and quiet, with what i feel is no resolution. After a very variable amount of time he will turn back to normal, but before, there will be no signs of any affection, not even simple politeness as in goodnight or hello when coming back home. 
I feel personally i can very quickly push aside the initial emotional reaction, but i do insist on a discussion to determine why we are in a fight, and to learn something about how we function and why the argument arose in the first place. This makes me feel like the argument at least had some positive aide effect. After, i can be sad or hurt or angry, but ultimately i still love my SO soy signs of affection stay, as in small touches, kisses, questions about other topics than the fight ... He cant stand it, and i can't stand his coldness, as if i would suddenly become a stranger. He actually manages to control himself and wont even do the spoon while sleeping, which usually always occurs at least once a night. I feel very rejected, and my natural reaction is to push and ask questions as the why he is like that (to which he just responds that he is as usual). Eventually, as i am not good in letting go, the questions annoy him so much that it restarts an argument. 
How can i endure during his coldness, or how can i make him understand my point of view, that his coldness affects me in a negative way as much as my questions and search for a human touch affect him?  It feels like he can just switch between ""i love you, let's be together forever"" and ""you are a nuisance and i do not even want to discuss weather with you"". A thing to mention maybe is also he doesn't even manage to look me in the eyes, and often just stops responding to my even most basic (and calmly put) questions. Like i dont even exist. I dont know how to deal with it anymore... And I'm sure he feels the same, but i really cannot force myself to just be nonexistent for days while living with someone.

Brother and his gf are staying at the place I’m renting because they are getting evicted, I walked into their old unit, and it’s in a complete disarray. Like someone is going to jail bc they arnt going to get anything out. Luckily my brother wasn’t in the lease, and has his address marked here, but that’s another story. 

I go to their unit, and cat shit and piss everywhere and ofc where the dog sleeps as well. She says someone’s caring for the animals but if that’s the case it’s the poorest excuse of care.

We’ve given my brother all the advice we can think, even finding a place for them, but she won’t think of them, and offered it to her parents, luckily it was gotten before they could ruin that unit too... but we’ve recommended them breaking up but she retaliates with she’ll kill herself, and blah blah more emotional abuse.

I’m to the point where I want to kick her out and leave my brother, if I call the police, my brother will just leave, but she’s literally a boulder that won’t budge for anything... 

So how would I get rid of this emotionally abusive Boulder that’s ruining my brother while retaining him in the family.

About a year ago, we had some *serious* bedroom troubles. There was an injury, depression, and a jealousy factor that all contributed to us not having sex much... Or at all really. I tried really hard, but he seemed so unattracted to me, and I got very self conscious. So for about 8 months there we were not having any real sex, and it was obvious we both hated it when we did.

We've come around the corner now a bit, mostly just be seriously cutting down on how much we have sex. My sex drive is obliterated, so once every week or two is about all we manage, but we're both comfortable with it I think. Problem is, I'm very very kinky and I dont feel fulfilled.

I won't tell him that because I think that's hurtful, but I've casually brought up poly relationships which he doesn't shoot down outright. Twice he's mentioned that it's fine if I sleep with other people, as long as he doesnt know about it. He knows it would bother him if he found out. Which to me, seems like it's not really permission, and they last thing I want to do is hurt him. I am *content* with our sex life, but I would seriously like to be able to adventure out and ""fill that hole"" if ya know what I mean ;)

I really don't think he would be okay with the idea, and the fact that I would have to hide it makes it seem so much worse. Im afraid of even bringing it up in a more serious conversation because I don't want to hurt him, or make him think he isn't enough for me. My marriage is my main priority here, though I am realistic in the fact that suppressing my sexual nature will likely turn out poorly for us. Any advice?",2019-07-07 01:15:05,15,0,relationship_advice

I broke up with him today. I have no more feelings for him, but he does. I don't hate him, I told him we could be friends, but I'm afraid that I'm doing more harm than good by still texting him. I'm trying to give him advice and reminding him to eat/stay hydrated/take care of himself basically and listening to what he has to say. 
It breaks my heart to see him like this, but I know he'll break it harder if I got back with him. 
I don't know..should I text him again or stop doing it cold turkey?

795,c9yx98,Zestyclose_Banana,I 26/F am feeling increasingly like a parent to my girlfriend 26/F due to our finances,"My partner and I both work from home because we're not in a great position right now mentally. We both do tasks for payments, each task equals 10-20 cents and doesn't take long at all to do.

&amp;#x200B;

We're doing this until we can find ""real"" jobs but lately, things have been SO strained because my partner is screwing off during the times they should be working. Last month they made 250$ when with the time they worked they should have made at least 600$. I had to make up the difference and we almost got kicked out of where we're living due to being short. If it happens again this month then we'll probably end up homeless. We barely have groceries right now. Even with these issues she's not doing what she needs too work wise to keep us afloat.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to help her and remind her of what we need but they blow up at me and call me a manager. She had a mental break down and started saying ""I live with my manager!"" and started freaking out at me...She tells me she hates it when I sit behind her because she thinks I'm watching everything she does, etc. but realistically I have no where else to go. We live in a very small room that barely fits a bed and desk and I'm forced to work on the bed most of the time due to our living conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't want to be homeless? I don't want to not eat? I mean she will sit there and ""work"" but do 20 tasks or less an hour, spend most of her time on discord and other websites. It's so frustrating but if I critique her in any way she gets so mad at me and starts crying in rage.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to deal with this. She's just not pull her weight and I've been incredibly nice about it so far and even my niceness has been met with this behavior. I told her if she does 40 an hour (very easily done btw I can bang out 100 or so an hour) that we'll be okay and nothing came of that. I'm so lost and hopeless right now.

&amp;#x200B;

She also has found some odd jobs she's trying to do involving writing and that is GREAT. I am happy she is motivated to do that but it's all freelance and while she's networking for jobs she doesn't have any yet so ... no pay. I suggested we focus on what pays and do that on the side, but it's all she focuses on. I'm burnt out. There are so many things we need and we can't have simply because she can't focus.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Literally just talked with her again an hour ago. I'm sitting here silently and I can tell she's still not doing her part work wise. She's tabbing inbetween reading a book, has a movie on and has several ongoing discord conversations. It's taking all of my energy to not say something because if I do she'll just yell at me.",2019-07-06 21:28:43,1,2,relationship_advice

798,c9yvzb,amicus_elephantus,She broke up with me 2 weeks ago and I have not talked to her in 8 days I want her back but I don't think she will come back.,"My girlfriend and I dated for almost 3 1/2 yrs and we met in our senior year of high school and we're both 18. We both lived in southern California, but when we first started dating we had already been accepted to our respective schools, her's in Montana and mine in southern California. We decided that the relationship was worth it and to continue long distance anyway. So we were together in California for about 6 months before we left for school and during that time we did so many fun and great things and then once she left for school it was really hard, but we made a commit to visit each other at least every other month and she would come down during the breaks. We also talked to each other on Skype every day and then she would come down for about three months in the summer and then intern during that time. We continued to do lots of fun things and we talked about our future and both working and living in LA after we graduate and it seemed fine for all this time. 

When she went back to school though after this most recent break she had alot of tough classes and got a job and school and with that she met a Bunch of new friends. Now I should mention that she has always has had a problem with keeping a stable friend group her whole life. So whenever she meets a new group of people she gets extremely excited and acts like there the best thing and everything they do is amazing. Then after a few months they would different classes or people would graduate and then they would drift away.

 Back to the Mainstory though after Christmas we began Skyping less and more just talking on the phone because we were both busy for alot of the day and she would end up  working with her new friends alot talking to them alot and hanging out with them alot more than she usually hung out with other people. Spring break eventually came though and then she came down and we had a blast and everything seemed like usual and she seemed normal. 

Then when she went back to school for six weeks and things went about the same way as before spring break. When she came back though she seemed very different than when I saw her during spring break. She was more distant and Cold and not as loving nor did she really want to kiss much or hold hands or have sex. She was constantly on her phone even when I was around her and she constantly talked about wanting to do things with her new friends from work and talked about doing things she never would have wanted to do just a few months before. 

One example is when she turned 21 she never wanted to drink and thought very negativly of it and I kind of felt similar. When she got back though she constantly wanted to try alcohol and go to bars and try lots of new foods she would never want to try just a few months before. I pushed back on us doing alot of these things and kind of ignored them and I regret that now even though many of those things I was not too comfortable with. She also dyed her hair pink which is something she would never think about doing a couple months before. Also she used to be and for most the part pretty conservative and all of the sudden that was not the case.

 We still went and did fun things though and had great times doing them. Less than a week before she broke up with me we went to the Getty (which is one of our favorite places to go) and she had a blast and I saw much of the old her that day and she wasn't on the phone nearly as much and we talked lots that day and got excited about going to exhibits way in the future. A couple days later though she called me and asked if she wanted to hang out, so I went over to her house and saw she was sitting out front on the porch which I thought was odd, butt I thought we were just going to hang out like every other day but when I sat down she then broke up with me. 

At first I was in shock and I could not believe she would do this. She had always been broken up with in her past relationships and I never thought she would do it to me. I talked to her then for about an Hour and a half and she said that I did a absolutely nothing wrong and was an amazing boyfriend and one in a million, but that her heart was not in it as much anymore and she felt that she could not 100% be there for me while she goes through her changes.

 I pleaded with her that I could go through these changes with her and I told her and I loved her and she told me she loved me too. She said she had been thinking about since she got back and needed to do this. I asked her if there was another guy and she said she had some chemistry with another guy at school and she had been texting him while she was back and she had some feelings for him but she insisted that she was not breaking up with me for him. After this I had to leave to process what happened.

 so She gave me a hug and I left and when I got home I went into full panick mode and had no Idea what to do and I just wanted her back. My family and friends did there best to keep me busy and after a few days I wrote her a long very heart felt letter and brought up lots of memories and said we could try to work things out and I bought her beautiful flowers and I asked her mom if she could give them and the letter to her after she got off work. When she got off of work and found them she called me and I tried to ask her to take me back and we eventually agreed to meet the next day.

 On the next day I dressed very nice and shaved and I went to her house and we talked for about 2 hours and discussed many things and went through many emotions. I brought alot of pictures and objects of old memories to help her remember them and poured my heart out to her and told her now that I know how she felt we could work through it and I was willing to try these new things because now I knew how important they were to her. This time though she was not nearly as sweet as the first time and seemed much more distant confused and frustrated. We also talked about the other guy and she said she had not told him and about the break up yet and I asked if should would date him and she no, at least not for a long time so it would not be a rebound she said she had passionate chemistry with him and that her new friends pointed out to her him and her had a connection and she said she kind of emotionally cheated on me and could never forgive her self for it and felt absolutely terrible about it.

 I felt very devestated and betrayed at this but I told her if she would give us another chance I would forgive her. She said she wanted to try all these new things at the beginning of the summer but right now that she did not want to continue the relationship if her heart was not 100% in it. I told her she would regret it if she did and not find another guys as loyal committed and carrying as I was. She eventually said she had to think for a few days and talk to her new friends about it and I asked her not to talk to them about it and she said she had to talk to them. I asked her if she could talk to her parents about, but she said she did not feel comfortable talking to them about it (her parents have been wanting her to get back with me and think she is making a huge mistake). 

I then left and after a few days she texted me and told me to come over and I did and this time she was much more loving and kind than both previous times but she told me she could not 100% commit to the relationship right now and that she did not want me to change who I was for her and she needed to be by herself for a while and find her self and maybe sometime in the future we could work something out. I told her I could not just wait for her and I asked her if it was about this other guy and she insisted it was not and I asked her if she wanted to have sex with him and she said I don't know. She held me and gave lots of hugs and even kissed me several times while I asked her to give us another chance. She said if in a little while I did not hate her to not be afraid to talk to her and to not be a stranger. I also told her if she had any doubts to not be afraid to contact me but I could not promise my response and she said she would probably wait for me to contact her first so she would not hurt me even more. I said to her that I felt betrayed and hurt so badly and she said I had every right to be and then she started crying a bunch and she kept saying I did nothing wrong and she said she wished she we could have talked about this earlier. We then gave each other and big hug and kiss and I said I love you and she said I love you too and I said goodbye for a while. 

After this I was absolutely devastated and have been so ever since. I have not talked to her since then which was 8 days ago and Its so hard to resist the urge to talk to her. I'm trying the no contact rule to see if it will work but I don't know if it will. I also fear that if we can't work this out before she goes back to school in late August that she is gone for good. My family and friends have been encouraging me to move on and insist that I did absolutely nothing worng and was so caring and loving to her and she was controlling and I deserved much better than her. I can barley sleep at night now and I have lost 8lbs in the past 2weeks from a lack of appetite. I wake up every morning feeling absolutely horrible about my self and feel like a piece of shit and I don't think I can find someone as compatible as her because we worked so well together and had so many similar interests and we were always supper supportive of each other. I have been keeping busy but it only distracts me for a little while and then destructive thoughts and I will be in so much pain it is unbearable and it feels like it will never end. She also has posted things on social media of her doing fun things with her friends and she looks like she is having a blast and I am trying my best to do things but this sucks the joy out of me and I don't understand how she can look so happy after all we have been through and if she really cared this little of me. She posted a picture on the 4th of July of her with her friends doing the exact same thing we would do every year and it crushed me. I have been trying to avoid social media but it is very hard to that. I just want to get her back and I know no contact is one of the best ways but I feel like If I don't do something before she leaves its done for good. I feel desperate and have no Idea what to do. Also the Idea of her with this other guy crushes me and makes me feel like shit. Thank you all for reading this, any advice is appreciated.",2019-07-06 21:25:39,5,2,relationship_advice
799,ca16mn,HopefulReputation,My (22F) boyfriend (23M) told me his family doesn’t want him dating a White girl?,"# 

📷

My boyfriend is and has been my best friend and the greatest guy ever so I’ll send him this post so he can read the comments as well.

We’ve been dating for a few months. We’ve known each other for 2 years though and been good friends and best friends the entire time. I haven’t a single doubt that he’s the one for me and vice versa but his family is the issue here.

I’m White and was born and raised here. So I’ve been here my whole life, and my family has been here a long time and as a result they’re pretty chill. (Except for my brother, I will discuss him later). He’s Mexican American. He’s lived here since he was in kindergarten (or first grade I always forget) so he’s pretty liberal but his family is still traditional. He’s not allowed to date a non Mexican so it’s been a secret all this time. That doesn’t bother me, my family knows about this and is also cool with it. 

Anyways so two days ago he told me that his mom and dad were talking about his future and stuff when his mom said “you can date anyone as long as they are Mexican and then proceeded to laugh. He said she laughed afterwards and said she was joking but it was the kind of thing where it was a joke with a layer of truth to it.

From day one I feared this would be an issue, but he was fairly certain it wasn’t the case. He knew they were traditional but he didn’t think it would translate into this. He feels pretty bad because he didn’t think his parents were like that and he knows how much this sucks for me and him.

Also, My younger brother called my boyfriend an ""illegal alien"" and agreed with Trump and told him to get away from me. Fortunately, my older brother, and both my parents tore him a new one.

TLDR: My boyfriends family does not want him to date a White girl. I also have a racist brother who dislikes my BF deeply.

Just let me figure this out and see where it takes me.” to be honest i don’t feel that we broke up. i have a feeling that we will get back together and everything will be okay. i think that maybe him have some time alone will help him because he’s been stressed lately. another thing is that we had already planned to go to a concert next week, and i’m thinking that i will invite him but not as a couple. maybe the week apart will help? we have been through so much together and i don’t see us being apart. he and i were both crying as we said our i love yous before he left. do you think we could get back together? this has been the only thing that has happened between us. thank u.",2019-07-07 01:08:23,6,1,relationship_advice

802,ca12wa,Conflictedfriendhope,I (30/f) am wondering about how to approach a concern with a dear friend (30/f),"TLDR: Dear friend and I have different beliefs on personal roles in our relationships and decisions. Particularly, in this case, she believes her husband has the ultimate say with money matters and has limited her social spending in accordance with this, spending a set amount determined by him. Should I /How can I address concerns I have about her without making her feel like it’s just because I have different beliefs?

Friend and I have been dear friends since being assigned as roommates in college twelve years ago. We are both Americans but live in different states. Over the years we’ve stayed in touch primarily through phone and social media, but we’ve also made trips to see each other, and sent packages in the mail. 

She and I are very close, though we do have differing viewpoints on some things. We are both passionate about what we believe. In brief, she is conservative Judeo-Christian with traditional views about gender roles in a heterosexual marriage, and I’m a loopy lefty with progressive perspective. We are both people in helping professions with advanced degrees (my role related to counseling, hers related to health). We are also both employed in our respective fields.
 
Almost two years ago she married someone with a shared perspective on marriage and religion. I respect that she and I have different ideals for a healthy marriage and boundaries. I actually don’t know him all that well and being far away, I have not gotten to know him. I have gifted him a study care package at one point, as he is working towards a degree, and I have done my best to be friendly.

I am writing to ask about an outside perspective to outline a fair approach to the topic of money. I know it’s a loaded topic. She told me about a recent sharp disagreement with Different Friend that came down to Friend requesting ten dollars from Different Friend to go towards Different Friend’s birthday meal, since it was ten dollars more than what her husband had agreed to be spent. 

It confirmed for me a pattern I had noticed, related to funding.  I noticed this past Christmas, I did not get a usual package from her. 30th birthday six months later, I received a dear card. (I was very happy to send her a bugger than usual gift package for her own thirtieth a number of months before). I noticed this difference and didn’t want to press, as I thought maybe money was tight. She and her husband have had a recent move, he is in school, etc. They do both work. 

Here’s the thing. She has posted more than one vacation on social media that was out of the country, and today she told me her husband was buying a new motorcycle.

I think that money is a deeply personal thing. And for her, it’s a shared topic with her husband. If I were confident that she was budgeting these things and deliberately cutting out funds she would have previously been comfortable spending on friends, I would shrug and adjust. But I’m deeply worried that husband is actually undermining priorities and controlling the pursestings in a way where he gets to choose what’s important or what’s too much money, or what is and isn’t worth spending money on. 

My deep concern is that my friend has agreed to this arrangement out of obligation and belief that it’s the right thing in a religiously devout marriage. But from my perspective, it seems controlling, and I’m worried that she is forfeiting a natural part of being an adult, that is, spending money as one sees fit. Obviously, when committed to a partner, discussions and decisions are healthy together as both are affected. But I am not convinced that their arrangement is such that they are both being held to the same standard of what is and isn’t a waste. 

She is visiting me in less than a week because of a trip her husband is required to take nearby. If I am to address this topic, I’d like to do so in person.

803,ca12kc,Maukin,I don't know what to do anymore," 

I (28m) have been in a relationship (27f) for the past two years now, mostly it has been fine with only one recurring issue. Sex. She said after a year we can talk about it, when it got close to a year she changed it to after meeting parents. I met her parents and then she changed it again from meeting parents to after marriage. Now at the end of this month she is going to meet my mum, but now any physical intimacy is gone, nothing is happening at all now except for small kisses and hugs. I am just constantly being rejected from anything further we have done before and I am losing all confidence in this relationship and can see nothing positive.

Maybe some important info, I work in China and she is a Chinese girl. We made it very clear at the start of the relationship to talk about any small or big issues because they might be because of our cultures. I also have made it very clearly and consistently stuck to what I have said throughout the relationship that for me to get anywhere close to marriage I need to live with the individual first and that sex is also important for me and needs to happen before marriage.

TLDR: gf has constantly changed what she said regarding sex, it has now devolved into nearly no physical intimacy at all, lost in confidence in self and relationship.",2019-07-07 00:59:04,3,1,relationship_advice

806,c9yos7,thrxwaway18947,Does he [18 M] still love me [18 F] the same?,"SO [18 M] and I [18 F] have been dating for about a year now and we are about to go our separate ways for college this coming fall. He’s going to a college in Claremont (we’re both from CA) and I’ll be staying in our home town for my first year of college, which is about 8 hours away from him. This long distance will only last a year, as I’ll be attending a college that’s also in Claremont after a year (I’m not moving there just for him, this is my dream college). He’s my favorite person and we’ve been best friends for 2 years before we started dating and he knows me better than anyone else. In the past few months, however, he’s been texting less and less and I’m worried that we’re becoming more distanced. Texting is our main method of communication. This especially worries me for the year of long distance that’s ahead of us. He recently went to Japan for the summer to spend time with his family, and theres now a 16+ hour time difference between us for now. He has stopped updating me on the things that he’s been doing in Japan and texting me less frequently, and although I do support him spending time with his family, I enjoy knowing what he’s doing as it makes me feel less lonely. I’m worried that he either loves me less than he used to as he doesn’t seem to want to text me as much as he used to or he’s taking me for granted (I always keep him updated on my schedule as I know he likes it when I do). I’ve explained how I feel to him and he assured me that he’d try to text me more, but he really hasn’t been doing that. I don’t expect him to text me a lot during his day since he’s going around with his family, but he told me that he’d give me recaps of his day before he sleeps and he hasn’t been doing that. We also can’t call while he’s in Japan as our parents don’t know we’re dating, we plan to tell them a few years into college. I don’t really know what to do at this point, as he’s never acted this way before these past few months. At this rate, we’ve been texting for 2-3 minutes a day. Note that this behavior had started happening months before he went to Japan, but it’s just worsened while he’s there.

807,ca10sm,throwaway9983736,My boyfriend doesn't kiss me?,"Hi! I'm in a committed long-term relationship with my boyfriend, who I adore, but I feel like he's holding out on me because this is my first relationship and he says that he doesn't want to do anything I'm uncomfortable with. 

He's got the most experience out of the both of us (he's 19 and I'm 18), and his last two long-term relationships were dicey and ended up with the women he was dating cheating on him or sexually pressuring him. 

I'm asexual, but I don't mind sex- its just not something that I ""need"" in a relationship, but I love affection and physical intimacy like kissing and cuddling. 

I've been dating him for over 6 months and we're reaching our 1 year anniversary soon and he still doesn't really initiate anything. I've always been the first one to hug him, I'm usually the big spoon, and I was the first one to kiss him. But after that he just... didn't ever initiate anything. He says he loves me, and he does consistently visit me and spend time with me but I just feel like I'm being treated as a friend and not as a girlfriend. 

I don't know if he's actually physically attracted to me or if he wants to kiss me and I'm too scared to ask because I don't want to come off as pushy or like I'm trying to pressure him into doing anything sexual. I just want a nice makeout session that I don't have to initiate myself, yenno?? 

I don't know what to do. Do I ask him? Wait for him to start initiating? I'm just lost.",2019-07-07 00:53:43,7,1,relationship_advice
808,c9x64c,manyaksagabi,Im an (18M) who met this (19F) in a camp a month ago. I don't know where my relationship with her should head...,"Alright so let's start from the beginning. Sorry if this might seem long for whoever reads this. I just feel like I  have to give some sort of context here so that I might receive a more detailed advice than of a general one which I can literally search up (no offense).

She was basically my group leader and I had a little crush on her during the camp. I immediately started private chatting right after the duration of the camp, although she was the one that initiated first actually but it wasn't like a personal subject or matter. Anyways, as the days went by our chat became more flirty I guess you could say? I don't exactly know but we started creating inner jokes, teased one another on a certain personal level, complimented each other and sent each other cute message stickers (like the ones actuallt made for couples). I enjoyed our conversations so much that my liking towards her just grew much larger. My problem however with our conversations is that it either snowballs (like we talk till midnight) OR she literally leaves me hanging as the last guy messaging her even though her status says that she's active/online and we have yet to finish/end a conversation (getting inboxed). That leaves me as the guy who has to constantly initiate once more an interesting out of the previous topic opener everytime so that I can hopefully get her attention.

Now, I know some of you might already be thinking that there might be some causes or reasons behind this: college/academic priorities, a lot more other people chatting with her, sleeping time, probably forgot etc. Yeah I've gone through the list in my head pretty much. Yet, I still wonder and I hate the idea of it, but is she really inboxing me because she wants to prevent me from leading on to a more romantic phase? And rather she chooses to place me on that spot of the so-called ""hell"": THE FRIEND ZONE. If not, then I don't understand why she chooses to not respond even though our conversations snowball and become so interesting (ignoring the ""reason"" list I aforementioned). And for those who think that she probably already has someone, I think she's currently not in a relationship (I mean she gave me a subtle answer of her being single and I hope to dear god she really isn't in one).

A month later since we met and started chatting, our conversations would rarely snowball now compared back then. As always, I usually became the guy that was left hanging and initiating. During the span of the month I came up with this elaborate plan to ignore and not talk to her for a few days to possibly not be seen as a clingy type of person or so that I would come to see if she would ever think of me and possibly start a conversation. Long story short the plan failed and I initiated once more like the sad man I am. A few days ago, I asked her on a date but like in a subtle way. I asked her if she wanted to eat lunch and watch a movie after we hit the gym (we both coincidentally go to the same gym but I've never encountered her at all). She answers that she's not allowed to go out on that day and pitches the idea rather of having a group reunion outing from the camp. Now, I don't know the exact reason why she chose to not go through with my subtle date but either she's busy on that day or she know its a date and is not interested in choosing to lead on a romantic phase as aformentioned thus choosing to invite more people for an outing for creating that mutual state of feeling. 

Alright so there we have it. To summarize I'm constantly getting inboxed and at the risk of being friendzoned.

With this, I need advice.

Should I keep pushing through in having a more romantic relationship with her? Meaning I'm going to have to constantly being the one initiating and possibly be revealed as that one clingy guy who's not even her boyfriend

or 

Should I just leave it be? Stay as good friends or forget about her? Wait till the next ""one"" comes?

To be honest though I feel like she is the one. I know I'm pretty young and its probably just hormonal stuff thats messing up my brain. But trust me the fact that I know this proves that I am not that much of a gullible teenager. I've been in a puppy relationship with other girls before and yet she really makes me feel different. She's really honest, funny, independent and down to earth. I love her eyes and that genuine smile of hers. Talking with her literally makes my heart race and I try so hard to make sure I don't screw up whenever I chat with her. In the end, I just don't want to let her be that one girl who got away. The right one who came at the wrong time (especially if you tell me that she and I should be focusing more on our academics and future which I understand)

I appreciate any advice or feedback that will be given! Please help me out with this because once again I am left hanging by her :(

809,c9x5t8,sketchyphoneloser,Boyfriend of 4 years wouldn't show me his phone?,"My bf and I used to use Kik to talk when we first met and eventually we both agreed to delete it and use something else. Fast forward like a year later, yesterday, he was showing me something on his phone and I'm 98% certain I saw a kik notification pop up. I immediately inquired about it to which he got super defensive. I kept saying show me your phone and show me you don't have it. But he'd keep playing this little game like unlocking it for me then saying he doesn't need to and closing it again. Over and over. A few times he'd have it open but would like press and hold things  (I was sad so i kept looking down and away a few times) so like 30 minutes later he finally let me see if he had it or not. Which he didn't because now I think he deleted it while we were there. When I asked him why he wouldn't show me the first time around he said it's because I'd make a bigger deal out of other things I might see on his phone!? I wasn't going to check the whole phone I was just going to make him search ""Kik"" in the search bar for apps.

810,ca0zs8,bluefox221,Tinder Guy “Stood Me Up”/Lead Me On,"This happened around the beginning of June. I’ve (F18) had the dating app Tinder previously and had good as well as bad experiences. I decided to delete it for a while, but then later get it again. I came across this one guy’s (M19) profile in particular who I found to be very attractive. He had this awesome kind of hipster style going on with longish bleached blonde hair and a nose ring. His bio was catchy and so was his face. I swiped right, and what do you know— it was a match. He messaged me first and his lead in sentence was a reference to a vine. I thought this was funny. We talked on there for a while until I ended up adding him on Snapchat. He seemed extremely genuine in what he said. Our conversations seemed meaningful and we both had similar interests and got along well. He told me a lot about himself and so did I. I felt like we were forming a good connection. He did send a picture of his face when asked to show me he’s real. It was definitely the same guy from the pictures on the account. I asked one night if he wanted to talk on the phone and he agreed. It was only a bit awkward at first, but he was good at keeping a conversation going. About an hour went by and I said I’d let him go since he sounded like he was getting tired. This was around 10 pm. He messaged me afterwards and told me he enjoyed our conversation and he liked my voice. He told me a lot of nice things ever since we’d been talking— like, “you’re super hot and I don’t know why you’re talking to me” or “I haven’t met you and I think I like you already.” He also said “I’ve never talked to someone on Tinder as long as I’ve talked to you.” He invited me on a date to the movies. He actually brought it up a couple times and I told him it would have to be next week (it was like Thursday at the time) because over the weekend I was going to be on vacation with my parents. I was really excited and looking forward to meeting him. He did forget on Friday about my plans and ask if I wanted to come to a party at his house on Saturday and reminded him I totally would but I couldn’t. Over time, he began to respond slower and slower each time. We had planned on either Friday or Saturday that we would watch a movie on Monday. He told me he was looking forward to it. I lived kind of far away, but I told him I could get to a city that’s half-way when the time came and he said he could definitely pick me up there and we could go to the movie. Over the weekend, he eventually stopped replying all together. I remember I sent him a message on Saturday asking about the party. No response. Then on Sunday I asked if we were still on for tomorrow. No response. He didn’t even open my messages. It was now Monday and he hadn’t messaged me back for 2-3 days. Monday evening I was with two of my best friends. I was very upset that this guy had messed with me like this. I called him from one of my friend’s phones and our conversation went like this:

“Hey”
“Hey, who’s this”
[pause]
“It’s (my name) and I’m just really confused”
Then he hands the phone to a female.
“Hello? Who’s this?”
“Um, who is THIS?”
And then the phone is hung up.

I’m dumbfounded. Who is the girl? His friend? His girlfriend? So many questions. My male friend then calls Tinder guy a while later again on his phone.

“Hey, is this (Tinder Guy)?”
“Are you from New York?”
(My friend has a New York number)
“Maybe I am. Maybe I’m not... so I have a question for you— so, like, why are you such a piece of shit?”
[Girl takes the phone]
“Hello?”
“Hey. So why is your friend messing with people’s feelings on Tinder? He seems like the type of dude to have around 3 STDs now.”
[Call ends.]

I then send a text message to him saying basically, why would you do this to me? I don’t understand, you’re a jerk, etc. There is no reply and no more communication with him after this point.

I guess I’m just confused by the whole situation. I have a lot of questions that have been and will go unanswered. So I’m asking the smart people of Reddit, does anyone have an idea of what could’ve happened, or why he did this? It’s been haunting me for a while now.

812,c9r0zf,EmmiRoeo,An asshole has torn my friend's confidence and now she is struggling with an eating disorder,"My friend from Morocco has been leaving in Paris for 2 years. We met in London 5 years ago during her gap year and we became quick friends. The thing is she is very pretty. She has a gorgeous face with long and voluminous hair. Body wise, I would say... she looked like a 90's Beyonce: Flat stomach and slightly large hips. She usually dates other maghrebins (people from north Africa) which is totally fine. However she recently got a date through  facebook with a white guy. I wouldn't say he is handsome. He has a normal face. Truth be told I'm not into blond guys. So I might be biased. But I'll give him this, he has a conventionally attractive body. 

Basically after a long back and forth conversation they ended up meeting, that was in January,  I think. According to my friend the date went well. Nothing out of the ordinary. We met that night to wàtch a TV show at hers. At some point during the night she gets a few texts. I see her face slowly decompose until she excuses herself to the bathroom. When I ask if shes ok, i hear muffled cries. She passes me her phone  and there it is. That guy texted her a bunch of mean messages. 

It's not so much the content that is disturbing but the way he said it. 

Hello *my friend's name*,
I find it dishonest that you tried to fool me with your fake profile pictures on Facebook. You looked much thinner in them than when I met you. Had I known you when such a fat cow I wouldn't have even bothered. I feel cheated. Even if you were to lose the excess weight you would still get fat again because if we are together you would have to take birth control pills which would end up making look like a whale. I am someone that takes good care of himself and I expect the same from my partner. You need to get off your fat ass and start working out. 

There was also a detailed description of what the body of a woman should look like among other things. Ever since the incident my friend has been feeling down. To be fair, she had a lot of ""shit"" happen to her but I feel like this has added to her already high stress level. Ever since she received that message she has deleted all of her social media accounts. She has deleted all of the pictures from her phone. She also has stopped wearing form fitting clothes - basically she only wears black. And, what slightly worries me she has started pigging out. I have in the past struggled with binge eating disorder. That's how I used to cope with stress. I have had several talks with her about it. Nothing has helped her. I did talk to her brother, it made things worse. He parents called her and basically fat shamed her into getting in shape. She has gained 20 kg since then, which is a lot... I'm not worried about the weight gain, I'm more worried about her bad eating habits. I'm not sure how to help at this point. I have tried getting her to go to a psychologist she has resisted the idea. 

Basically people, if you dont have anything nice to say STFU. I get that you may have preferences and all that but you dont have to shoot someone down just for sports.",2019-07-06 07:43:34,8,24,relationship_advice

We’ve only had like two little disagreements/little fights. The most recent one is that I went out to get more groceries for the apartment, and I spent $48. My boyfriend sent me a message basically saying, “Why would you go out and spend $50 for things than we don’t need/might go bad before they even get used?” We split everything, so I only ended up paying $24 for everything. (I went to Aldi). I got some freezer stuff and more milk, ramen, and bread. (Our last grocery trip we literally got nothing for $99.) it’s just kind of irritating that he would say something like that. I just didn’t want him to have to eat cereal for a snack every single day. I even calculate every paycheck how much I’ll have left after bills/gas.

815,ca0vvs,kyliegh0,I think my (19F) boyfriend (18M) is taking advantage of me,"TL;DR at the bottom

So i’m in a personal dilemma that i’m not sure what to do about. So my boyfriend got kicked out of his dads house and I live with my aunt but I asked my parents if he could stay with them and they said yes. For 2 months he was staying rent free and got free food and was asked to do very little around the house so he could save up his money from work to get his own place. 

My parents eventually asked for him to pay $75 a week for rent and food until he found a place because they couldn’t afford for him to stay without it. He decided that he would just live out of his car, but I didn’t want him to have to do that so I asked my aunt if he could stay and she said yes as well, rent free and free food. For another 2 months he’s been staying here with me. 

Here is where it gets to the point where I think he’s taking advantage of me. I go to college full time and I work about 10-15 hours a week. Right now i’m on break but my work hasn’t been scheduling me as much. He works full time making $12/hr so he can easily afford to move out now. He’s asking me to move in with him at the place he found for $550 a month which I want to do, but he wants to pay $250 in rent, half of utilities, and my own food. Right now I am making a maximum of $600 a month including the money that I get for college. Right now I wouldn’t be able to afford all of the expenses as well as my car payment and other misc. things and he’s telling me that I just need to work more. 

I asked if he could at least lower the rent to $200 (that’s ALL I asked) so I was able to have some money left at the end of the month. He refuses and says he could get a roommate to easily pay more than what he’s asking and that i’m getting “a great deal” and couldn’t find anywhere else this nice for this cheap, which is true. I’m stumped because i’m tired of living with my aunt but I absolutely can’t afford what he’s offering. He’s insisting that I can afford it and doesn’t understand where i’m coming from. 

Should I keep trying with this relationship or do you think he’s taking advantage of me?

TL;DR: I let my boyfriend stay rent free with me at my parents and aunts house for almost 5 months after he got kicked out of his dads house. He wants me to move in with him now that he’s found a place but he’s refusing to make it affordable for me saying that he knows I can afford it as well as saying that he could easily find a roommate willing to pay more than me.",2019-07-07 00:38:55,2,1,relationship_advice

I've met some pretty chill customers, but the one who actually matters anything is an elderly man who mentioned that his Grand Daughter has her MFA in Fine Arts, or at the very least something close to that. I honest;y can't remember exactly, but I think I'm close. My problem is that my university did a shit job at teaching me the fundamentals of drawing (like people and such) even though they are essential/mandatory for the animation that i do (character design, then transfer into my 3D program)

&amp;#x200B;

So, he gave me her card, and said I could hit her up. The thing is, I have no idea how to introduce myself. Like at all. Any help guys?",2019-07-07 00:36:36,8,1,relationship_advice

I don’t see her changing in the future because that doesn’t seem like something that can happen. We also still makeout but she says that isn’t intimate but she still likes it. 

I’m just wondering what I should do from here, I don’t want to break up with her but I feel like she’s lying that she’s going to change. At the same time she might just not be ready and doesn’t know how to express it (she has a hard time expressing how she feels).

819,c9yf4p,butlikewhythou,Should I [22f] leave my cheating bf [25m],"So, this may or may not be long. If it’s long, tl;dr is at the bottom, also this is on the phone and first post ever on reddit I hope it’s good enough. 


So, I’ve been with bf for about 6 almost 7 years. We’ve had quite the relationship to say the least, but for the most part it was a good relationship. We broke up about 3 years ago for a whole year, then got back together. I should also mention we have a 4 year old daughter as well. 

He travels for work and has been for the last two years, he makes good money and enough for me not to have to work and raise our daughter. So currently I’m a sahm. Just last month we moved 1500ish miles away from home for him to have a job where he no longer travels and can come home to us every night. So the situation is I stay at home with our child and wait anywhere from 3 months to 8 months for him to come home to us. I’m very happy and content with our current relationship and how we worked as a couple and parents.

Well, fast forward to today, I play Minecraft on his laptop a lot because my daughter broke mine on accident. I frequently have to close discord because it automatically loads when logging on. I also use this discord sometimes so it’s not like he hides anything or talks about anything bad. Welllllll, today I noticed a blocked conversation from a girl (no idea age or anything about her) so I clicked it open thinking it was a spam account and I’d see a funny pickup line or something? Unfortunately for me, it was not. He had a really close relationship with this girl last year in June, and I am heartbroken. 

He admitted to it, and said he had never met her or doesn’t even know her real name. The conversation was NSFW and very, very dirty. Like, we would talk on the phone nightly whether it was clean or dirty, he had his fill I felt like? And when he would come home from traveling he wouldn’t even barely touch me, and still doesn’t to this day. I’ve noticed this before and it wasn’t a problem because I mean, hanging on someone 24/7 is annoying. But we would have sex once a month he was home or once every 6 months. 
I understand everyone has needs, I’m just devastated. I don’t understand why he wouldn’t break up with me? Why would he just like to me for a whole year, just to tell me I’m all he wants and he regrets it? I’m lost idk why to do. 

Not to mention, he’s told me a couple of lies or just information he has withheld from me while traveling. We have moved to an area he worked in last year around this time so he figured he should tell me instead of someone else. None of the stuff he has told me was about women or cheating, but it was still trust breaking. 
Thanks for reading this far. 


Edited: made paragraphs. 
Also, if I leave him I’m going back to my home state with our daughter and leaving him here.

820,ca0rpy,ohwowsky,Not sure if I should stay connected with my ex on social media platforms,"I (f22) recently broke things off with a guy (m29). It wasn’t necessarily a “bad” breakup with harsh/terrible feelings, but something that happened with feelings that faded. 

Anyway, we have not deleted each other off of social media accounts. Initially I was fine with it because I thought it meant we could still potentially be friends or at least acquaintances. I still really like him as a person/friend. But I later found out that he isn’t on the same page about this, and would rather be strangers without harsh feelings (I don’t even know what this really means tbh).

Now that I know we can’t even be friends, I really have to remove his traces/memories out of my life because I miss him (as a person) a lot and seeing him online reminds of too many things. But I feel like deleting him off of social media now, after a few weeks had already passed, is a potential cause for drama; it might send wrong signs about how I feel now (bitter, salty, or whatever else).

I’m not sure what the best procedure to deal with this would be. Should I delete him off of my social media accounts knowing that could really send a message that we have ended badly?",2019-07-07 00:27:21,7,1,relationship_advice

might get a bit confusing so 

M = my boyfriend 
C = 20 year old roommate living in my boyfriend’s home

when i met my boyfriend a year and a half ago, he lived in a house 30 minutes away from me with his stepmom. 

fast forward a couple of months, my boyfriend and i are getting more serious, and his stepmom allows my boyfriend’s (we’ll call him M) friend’s girlfriend (we’ll call her C) to move in because she wasn’t in a great home situation 

it was whatever at first, M and i weren’t happy about it since we were basically living in that house together, and i didn’t know C at all so i was very uncomfortable 

it eventually caused a lot of issues in our relationship, C was supposed to be living there temporarily (3-4 months), it’s now going on a year and she’s still there

in december/january, things with C blew up so bad that M and i relocated to my house where we lived from about january-now

i know it was a big move for M, he had to leave his childhood home, his friends, and his family, though they’re still only 30 minutes away

i also had to leave my home, friends, and family when i was living in his house last year

the problem is, we broke up and we’re trying to figure out a way to be together and incorporate both of our needs

he says he needs to live at his house, i guess he has an attachment there since he grew up there and some of his friends live close

i tell him i can live in his house with him, just not right now while C is still living there. C hurt both me and my boyfriend so incredibly bad, and turned my boyfriend’s stepmom against me, so being in his house with all of that still going on right now is not possible for me. 

i told M if he was willing to sleep at my house, maybe we could go to his house during the weekends, he could spend however much time that he wants there during the week, we can drive up and see his friends and family whenever, we can clear out my house so he can have space to be himself here, i basically offered everything i could think of and he doesn’t want to do any of it

i am not able to be in a relationship with him while he or i are living at his house with C, the roommate. i tried it for a very long time and it ended up hurting both of us, i am not able to go back or deal with that house at all while C is still living there and i’ve made that clear since january 

i’m not sure what to do, i’m trying very hard to meet M in the middle, and to make sure both of our needs are taken into account. he wants this to work, but isn’t really willing to give up completely living in his house right now, which doesn’t take any of my needs into account

if C wasn’t living there obviously none of this would be an issue, but unfortunately she is not going anywhere. both M and i have tried time and time again to let the stepmom know that C being there is ruining our relationship and our friendships, and there is no action taken, no matter what C does to hurt M and i

we have also talked about not being together until C moves out, but that’s the very last resort and neither of us wants that to happen

just feeling very lost, not sure how to accommodate both M and i’s needs in order to make things work. how should i move forward while incorporating both of our needs?

TL;DR: boyfriend and i want to be together, not sure how to have both of our needs met (his need is to live in his house with the roommate who ruined our relationship because that’s his childhood home, my need is for us to sleep at my house because of the roommate, but i would do everything i could to make sure he’s at his house as much as he needs to be happy)",2019-07-06 20:35:06,2,2,relationship_advice

I’m an 18 year old about to college, who has been in one relationship before my previous one! it was very toxic and caused me to have a lot of issues where I absolutely am not ready for a relationship and only really do hook ups, but this one guy would not take no for an answer 

id like to say I do like him and he’s fun to be around, but I made it clear I wasn’t ready for a relationship and he labeled us immediately and said I love u on our second date.
he’s really cool, and i’d love to be his friend, but lately he kind of just didn’t text me for three days straight and hung out with a girl he knows which, just makes me feel not good so I said I don’t really know if I want to be in a relationship, and when I said that he broke down

he told me he was feeling suicidal thinking about leaving me and even came to my house to bring me flowers and cried when he saw me

i’ve always been afraid to say no in relationships, and stand my ground bc of my past relationships which he does help me work on and he does make me feel good, but I don’t really want to go into college in a month in a relationship which he is aware of.

I don’t know an easy way to break up with him without him like feeling suicidal? please help

edit: he’s on antidepressants and his parents are aware that he can sometimes be suicidal!! his mom doesn’t like me because we hooked up in her house and she thinks he should wait till marriage and I don’t really know his friends:))",2019-07-07 00:14:20,6,1,relationship_advice

828,ca0mxh,myheart21,"My [21F] BF [24M] started kissing and groping me in the middle of the night while I was asleep, I don’t know what to think.","Okay so this is my first post on reddit so please bear with me, I’m also on mobile so sorry for the weird formatting. English is also not my first language, so I apologize for any mistake. This is a very long post, I understand if you don’t want to read all of it but I appreciate any advice you’re willing to give me.

I have been with my boyfriend for 4 months now, and I love him very much. For the past month I have been debating whether I should ask for advice on here about something that happened between me and him, and another post on this sub convinced me to share my problem, in hopes of finding a solution.

So about a month ago I stayed over at my boyfriend’s house for the night cause we had a brunch to go to the next morning. It was my second time ever sleeping at his house, so it was still pretty nerve wracking (he’s my first boyfriend and I’m not used to sharing a bed with anyone). That night we went to a bar with friends and he wanted to drink more than usual so I agreed to be the designated driver so I didn’t drink at all that night. I drove us back to his place at around 1am and we went to bed.

At around 3am (according to him, I was way too sleepy to realize what time it was), I felt pressure on my body only to realize that he was on top of me, kissing me. I was still asleep when he started, the kissing woke me up. He then started fondling my breasts and put his hand between my legs. That freaked me out because we had already been intimate in the past but by that point we hadn’t had sex yet, so intimacy was still new for me. I tried to say “no”, but somehow the word wouldn’t come out, so he obviously didn’t hear it. I tried to say “babe” to get his attention but it barely came out as a whisper that even I couldn’t hear, so he was oblivious to that too. I tried to grab his wrist to get him to let go of my private parts, he removed his hand only to put it right back. I grabbed his wrist one more time to get him to stop but I was still so asleep that I had absolutely no strength whatsoever.

He eventually stopped and went back to sleep. I spent the rest of night tossing and turning wondering what to do about it. That morning I woke up in a bad mood. As we were getting ready to go to brunch he said, “wow I can’t believe what got over me last night, I just woke up thinking “me want some””. I looked at him and told him “yeah I noticed, but next time, please ask.” He looked at me with sorry eyes and apologized. I barely looked at him and said it was okay. He came up to me, apologized again and gave me a hug. The rest of the day was uneventful but I wasn’t as cheerful and I refused any physical contact besides small pecks on the lips.

He hasn’t done anything like that since, I’ve stayed at his house a few times, including times where he’d had a lot to drink and he never tried anything like that again. I want to believe that he’ll never do it again, but now that we’ve had sex I’m afraid that he won’t know when to stop if he were to try again. I trust him (it’s very hard for me to trust people), and he’s always been extremely respectful of my boundaries, I just don’t know what to make of this. Was it sexual assault or harassment? I don’t want to break up with him but is there anything I should have done or anything I should do to make sure it doesn’t happen again?

829,ca0mx9,brokenpromises99,My now ex [M23] and myself [F23] had an argument and he physically abused me - says it’s my fault.,"I’ve been dating my now ex for four years and I know he has built up anger from the past, but never in my life had I thought things would lead to this. We got into an argument because I caught him out on a lie and I really dislike liars. I especially dislike it when he lies and just about a lot of times he lies. I told him it’s bad behaviour and that even his family knows he constantly lies and that they are not a fan of it. Well he didn’t like being lectured and went off the rails. 

He pushed my television off the stand and kicked into it. I yelled at him saying, “What the f**k; you don’t break someone’s things and especially when you can’t afford to pay them back for the damage.” I got so angry because I don’t have the money, I am living pay check to pay check. Which this was a bad move coming from me, but I started talking about how he has bad behaviours, that he’s not as tough as he makes himself out to be, that he craps on everyone that’s ever cared or been there for him and plays the victim a lot of the times. That’s when he then proceeded to strangle me, while saying that I pushed his limits. The thing is, I didn’t even cry or I wasn’t scared. He pulled away and I said, “What the f**k!” 

He then said that it was all my fault that he was like this. That I trigger him to get so angry that he has to hurt me. That I am a very crappy person and if I had just shut my mouth then he would have never hurt me. That I don’t know what happened in his past before him and how he used to get into a lot of fights and he could easily kill me. He then tried to call the police because he was saying I was making him suicidal. I’ve heard this suicide threat several times now. He grabbed my phone and threw it at the wall and the screen is cracked. I proceeded to get my phone and he went back to strangling me, then hit my face on my bedside table, and threw me on the floor before putting his hand into a fist and saying, “This is all your f**king fault.” 

I went to lock myself in the bathroom, my face was bleeding a little bit. I yelled for him to leave the house or I’m calling the cops. He leaves the house then an hour later, I get a call from his mother asking why I slapped him and all that crap. I did not lay a damn finger on him. I told her that she knows her son lies, she need to re-evaluate what he said and think about who is really hurt. I hung up. He and his mother been trying to call me but I’m not having any of it. He’s sent me voice messages saying he’s sorry and stepped out of line. I’ve blocked them but they turned off their caller ID so it still goes through my phone. I’m getting a new number first thing tomorrow morning. His grandmother called me up and said she knows I didn’t do anything and told me to never get back with him because he has issues and he’ll never change. I have confided in his grandmother with a lot of things in the relationship and she has always told me to leave him. I should have listened in the first place. 

After all that, I don’t even know why I’m not scared of what happened. I just feel numb. I know what I said when I was angry wasn’t called for. I can take responsibility on that.

I'm thinking of sending her man screenshots of her admitting to cheating after what she told me.,"This is less about a romantic ""relationship"", and more about ""friendship"" or whatever that shit means now days. My now (ex best friend) of ten years, turned out to be the biggest bitch I've ever come across. A few months ago, she was in a bad abusive relationship. It was so bad (or at least she made it seem that way) she asked me to call the cops one morning -- I did. I was several states away at the time. The cops showed up, took a statement from her, they even had me take one over the phone; which I complied with. A few months later, she told me she was never actually abused or raped, after grilling the loop holes in her story. I had been several years ago. I feel like this bitch legit used my shitty past to lie, manipulate her own situation, and use it to her advantage. She knew I'd call the cops and be empathetic. I understand how dangerous and serious situations like that are. I had been piecing the pieces together for awhile (when she'd talk about the case and things the detectives mentioned -- there were too many holes in her story). So, I and another friend called her on it. She was livid.  But, fuck it, ya know? You're not going to use me like that and then expect me to stay quiet and stupid. Aside from this, when I got engaged, I didn't show off my ring the way most do -- I'm too shy to do that. I showed my Parents/Brother &amp; then her and my other best friend. She saw the message (it said read) and didn't say congrats or how she was happy for me. Now, to me, that hurt. I am always happy for my friends when good things happen to them and for them. In the past, when I would share good news with her, she would always say things like ""I'm so jealous of you and how your life is"". I always thought she was joking an always encouraged and did my best to help her pursuit her own career goals. 

&amp;#x200B;

She texted me a few days later. No Hi. No Hello. Now how are you. No congrats -- nothing. She did manage to ask me for advice; typical. After everything, I didn't say a word to her. I blocked/deleted her on everything. I don't want trash like that around me or mine. She messaged me on her second FB page saying congrats and asking if I was upset with her. Now, she has a clear habit of lying (which I now know) -- she also (I've seen her do this and have told her many times to not do shit like that -- she's 31 by the way), make fake profiles only to message people like a little pussy of how she hates them and can't stand them. Well, she did that to me when I wouldn't answer. Last month, they found lumps in both breast and said there was a low chance of it being cancer (as breast cancer does run in my family). I told ONLY her and my Parents/Brother/Fiance. My Family/Fiance would never do me dirty like this (we are close). I get a message saying ""Fuck being your friend. You're two faced. I wish you had actually had cancer and died"". Who the fuck even says that to someone? I confronted her. I asked if she was the one who did this after sending her the gross message she had sent me. She got really weird, wouldn't say if she did, and was talking about how she was being honest with her new man (which I don't even get why that came up -- it had nothing to do with the conversation). The new guy she's with... he opened up his home to her recently (she just moved in with him). But he has no idea she was cheating on him for MONTHS, she would use the money he sent her to  for groceries and bills -- would take ubers to fuck other guys and buy herself lingerie to wear for other men, she would call him fat and ugly; she also referred to him as her ""sugar daddy"". I know this guy.  She and I bumped heads when I told her-her attitude and behavior was disgusting. He's a nice person and doesn't deserve to be with someone who is only using him. He has no idea. I have screenshots/texts of her saying all of this. After her being such a piece of shit to me (and I had been feeling sorry for her man for months anyways because of her dirty deeds), would it be wrong if I sent him screenshots of the kind of creature he's dating? I honestly have never considered doing someone wrong like this, but, after being told to essentially die; fuck being polite.",2019-07-05 16:00:29,148,374,relationship_advice

short: When is it time to end what is otherwise a very healthy relationship - but the differences in life goals are becoming too glaring?

long: I've [30F] been with my fiance [28M] going on 9 years, engaged for the last one. It's always been a **very** healthy relationship, with the biggest stressed being things like getting our rescue puppy, moving in together, and maybe drinking a tad too much once every few years. But we are not without our faults - and I'm becoming increasingly worried that our differences cannot be surpassed. Instead I think they are becoming hard incompatibilities. The biggest problem that my career is taking off and needs me to move around the world. I previously agreed to a 2-year duration upon which returning to our hometown, to 'settle'. But I can no longer do this - for my own mental health. When we initially started dating I made it very clear that I would always go where my career took me. Sadly it took _way_ longer for this to occur. So long so, that I'm pretty sure my partner figured it would never actually happen.

836,c9y6dm,laura-williams222,My boyfriends (22) sexual past makes me (20F) insecure,"My boyfriend is a solid 9/10 looks wise , he’s handsome and has a very built body , I on the other hand am very insecure and maybe a 7/10 , his looks alone make me feel insecure and out of his league , we have been together for for 3 years and they have been amazing he’s my best friend and I love him , 

Before him I had never had a relationship of any sort and had only slept with 1 boy once and it was the worst mistake of my life , giving my virginity to someone who didn’t respect me as a person enough to text me after it , it hurt and I hated it and was overall disappointed that that was sex and thought “was that it ?” .

On the other hand my boyfriend has slept around a lot for his age , roughly 15 girls and has had too many to count when talking about blowjobs , he’s only ever had me as a girlfriend and no one else ,

I’m just upset that loads of women have touched him and had sex with him and it makes me feel insecure and upset to the point where I have had anxiety attacks when seeing these one night stands around our local area , it just make me upset that my body isn’t special and sex isn’t special to him , I want to desperately get over this and if you’re in the same position as me feel free to message me

837,c9y5ia,clomcha,"New friend constantly tells outlandish untrue stories. I like her as a person, but I'm conflicted about staying friends. Help!","I met this girl at a new job back in January and we hit it off immediately. We both quit the job around March and didn't communicate with or see each other again until about 2 weeks ago.

When I first met her she seemed like someone who'd lived an enventful life. She had a lot of hobbies and interesting things happened to her. I believed her until one day she told me this crazy story about how she ""just happened"" to meet a band member from a CRAZY famous band, went out with him, refused his engagement, and broke his heart.

It was kind of plausible because stranger things have happened, and I didn't think of it again. When we saw each other again she told me several outlandish stories. They started out believable, but with each one as she went into more detail they became obvious lies. I'd list them here, but I don't know if she or her boyfriend use reddit and i don't want to be doxxed. The short version involves partying with celebrities and knowing some very minor celebrities personally.

I like her as a friend. A **lot**. I **want** to spend more time with her. But I can't deal with the stories. Her lying just makes me want to cut her off. But if she stops telling stories I'd love to hang out with her more, so I'm conflicted. 

It's a new friendship, and I don't know what to do. Should I tell her to quit with the stories? I don't want her to cut *me* out as a result, but I don't know what else to do.

More details would get me doxxed, but I would really appreciate what advice you can give.


Edit: I don't care WHAT the stories are about. Just the fact that she's actively lying to me and she knows it. People I know irl have said that it's an attention thing and maybe she has a mental illness or at least feels like she needs more attention. I can handle mental illness. I'm mentally I'll myself. But lying to me is where I draw the line in any relationship, hence my being conflicted.",2019-07-06 20:21:03,2,2,relationship_advice
838,ca0j4a,kissingfish,Unsure if salvaging my (F19) relationship with abusive father (47M) and gambling addict mother (46F) is worth it.,"Title pretty much sums it up. On mobile so I apologize for formatting.  

I'm the middle child and the only girl of three children, and grew up watching my older half-brother bear the brunt of my father (his stepfather)'s physical and psychological abuse, in addition to suffering from emotional abuse myself. I never felt like I could truly complain because my dad never beat me like he did my brothers - which I guess is the best thing I ever got out of my father's sexism. At worst, my dad would get very close into my face and threaten to hurt me, and he's a very large muscular man, so you can imagine how younger me would respond. My dad believes that hard discipline and fear is the only way to garner respect from his children, and also became extremely religious in the past few years on top of that, forcing his rhetoric on all of his children (this part is relevant due to him suspecting that I'm a lesbian, that I don't dress or act like a women, etc). 

My only actual ""stability"" was my mother, who is way more lenient with her kids and frankly never disciplined us at all (which means she gets no respect from three kids who became just as angry and violent as her husband). Unfortunately, her vice is throwing away all her paychecks to internet cafes, BINGO, and scratch cards. Her gambling has caused a lot of heartache, hungry nights in, and sets off my angry father who takes it out on his kids. He calls her a child, and treats her as such. As much as I hate the way he talks about her, he's right. She thinks everytime that she messes up, disappears in the dead of night without answering her phone or telling anybody where she is, and gambles her entire paycheck away, she can cry and talk about how she's ""never going to do it again"" *without making any effort to change.* And she makes her family feel guilty when we get tired of it. My older brother has since left the house, joined the military, and moved to the other side of the country to get away from our parents. My mother complains constantly about it, how ""she gave up so much for him"" (she and my older brother are immigrants) and how she's his mother and how dare he treat her that way, yadda yadda. All I could think about is how she did nothing when my father beat him. She just turned away. 

The point is, I know that I can't continue to live with them, and I won't once I graduate college and save up enough. But I can't help but feel like I'm abandoning my youngest brother, who has over a decade left with them. But my biggest issue is whenever I thinking about cutting off all contact, that I'd be making some horrible mistake, I'll regret all the time I lost with them, that I'm overreacting like a typical teenager. All those angry feelings I had when I was younger have faded, but I reread all the things I went through in old diary entries and I *remember* all the stuff I wrote and all the stuff that I didn't. Is it worth it to keep them around? I know that the girl who wrote those journal entries would never forgive me if I forgave them, and I see my parents repeating the same things they did to me to my little brother. I see his bruises. 

 Can I look away like my mother did? 

TLDR; My dad has horrific anger issues, is trying to use his religion to suppress my sexuality and fuel his hatred for just about everything, my mother gambles all her money away and has failed to protect her children from her husband. She chose him. We didn't.",2019-07-07 00:03:03,3,1,relationship_advice
839,ca0ior,the-throw-away-wifu,How can I stop thinking or having anxiety about my girlfriend being with another guy when I’m not around?,"Hi, 
I have been with my girlfriend for about a year and a half. Here is just some facts about her. 
-she is very introverted 
-she shows her love in her own ways
-she is very independent 

So I am still in college and she just graduated before last February she mentioned us moving in together. She mainly stated it because she wants to stay up here for work but then she also wants me and her to stay close. This was a BIG step for her as a person and that took a lot for her to do that ( she is a very independent and “too herself” person). 

Anyway, she has never given me a reason to think she is messing around behind my back, she is caring, we have relations on a fairly steady basis and she always enjoys it. I just think my anxiety is messing with me.. it used too before we started dating for real anyway (we talked off and on seriously for over 2 years).. 

Any advice to help? I love her honestly and I’m looking forward to living with her. I just don’t wanna think or have anxiety about this anymore.. 
(I’m scared to say anything because I feel like I truly trust her and I don’t want her to have doubt that I do and feel bad about it)..

Thanks for reading everyone.",2019-07-07 00:01:47,6,0,relationship_advice
840,c9y3a1,hinwerfenaccount,My now ex-girlfriend threatens to kill herself and I don’t know what to do,"So a few weeks ago I [M21] broke up with my now ex [F21]. I proceeded to tell her that I would prefer if she would respect my wish of her not contacting me. She respected that for about a day or so. Then she started contacting me again. Asking me to give Her a new chance. I rejected her upfront and once more told her not to contact me. This request was not respected. After a few days of her wanting a new chance, the threats of suicide started. She has done this on different occasions when I had been talking to her about considering leaving her. We had come to a mutual agreement that if we were to break up these threats shouldn’t appear again. However this time the threats are so insisting that I am genuinely scared she might try something harmful to herself. I have proceeded to be respectful and tried telling her to seek help. But in the past week everything just collapsed for me and I started telling her very bluntly to stop texting me. She proceeded to keep on texting and calling me. And my tone gradually turned more and more aggressive. Even to the point where I no longer think I was behaving in the correct manner. All this has concluded in her telling me that I am the sole reason she no longer wants to live. She also tells me that it is my responsibility to make her want to live again. However the only reason I can find that will make her want to live again will be to take her back. This is just not something that I want to do. I know that if I take her back again, I will break up with her again and in time just postpone the inevitable. And at this point I actually am clueless as to how I need to tackle this delicate situation.",2019-07-06 20:15:32,4,2,relationship_advice
841,c9y2zt,CH3RRYSODA33,My [27m] girlfriend [25f] tried selling me her nudes,"I don’t even know where to begin

We’ve haven’t had sex since Valentine’s Day, and when we did she literally told me “let’s get this over with” things are rocky but most days we get along great. She got drunk a bar last week and texted me trying to sell me her nudes, I didn’t respond but this whole time I’m wondering if I’m an asshole for thinking she’s sold her nudes to other people while we were dating.

So I tried to talk to her about and she blew up at me accusing me of cheating with an old ex that had texted me months earlier asking to get a cup of coffee and catch up. It goes like this and eventually she said that 85 percent of her wants to break up but 15 percent is holding on to the fact that I might break down one day and admit everything to her. I can swear on everything I am I’ve never cheated on this woman. We said our last goodbye or what I thought were our last goodbyes, told her how much she’s changed as a person. 

Fast forward to today. I just can’t shake the feeling she’s cheating on me, my reasoning is that if she honestly believes I’m cheating on her it wouldn’t be that big of deal for her to “get revenge”. I tried telling her how I felt, and she blocked me and told me I was harassing her and that she was on her way to the one concert she could afford all year and that I was being unfair to her, that’s how we left it. I’m just so lost and my head is spinning, am I being manipulated? Is there anything worth saving in this relationship at all? I feel so embarrassed.",2019-07-06 20:14:45,18,2,relationship_advice
842,ca0i1n,throwMeFarrr,I want to go on a foreign exchange year.,"I have a girlfriend that I have been seeing for about two years. We were making all of these ambitious plans for what we were going to do in the future. We were going to go to the same university. And we made promises as to the future but right now the university part is what is important.

This past month and a half I went abroad on a little exchange trip, I guess you could call it. And despite it being a short time, I absolutely loved it. It was a great experience to leave the country more or less by myself and see what life is like outside of my country of residence. After coming back, I realized that I want to go back for longer. I also realized that I don’t want to go to the same university as her just because she is there. I want to be able to go to the best university I can, and I have even considered trying to get into a university in my exchange country.

Having said that, my heart still can't accept this. I know that spending a year abroad can be very tough on a relationship. Plus we were planning to go on a trip together for a week right out of highschool during summer holidays before uni. And this would sort of throw off everything.

I feel that I already know that I should not miss out on the experience and that I won't be able to do this when I'm an adult and have to work. *But how do I tell her?* We were set on being together and in the same uni. I'm starting my final year of school after summer holidays. *Should I tell her soon and risk an risk a break up?* We are both in the same close friend group and so it would be very awkward when we get back in school. *Or should I wait until right before we are planning on buying the trip?*",2019-07-07 00:00:03,2,1,relationship_advice

We'e been together 9 years, we bought a house 2 years ago and have a 2.5 year old child also we are engaged. For the last 2 years she has not been loving or affectionate. I've only  now come to understand this originated from 2 fuck ups of mine. The first fuck up was a Coke binge (out of character of mine) the 2nd a drink binge 6 months later. The coke taking stopped after the fuck up but she distanced herself enough and I thought I had got her back but could still feel the difference. I only found out a 2nd incident the drink binge caused a 2nd distancing if that makes sense. Since then there is no love from her side of the relationship. I can understand it but at the same time only realising now 1.5 years later that this relationship is over and should be stopped. It's hard to break up a family a home but at what point do you give up trying to make it work. I've changed my life to make this work but still there is nothing from her side and I now understand my fuck ups lead to this but why stay if there is no love or affection?

844,c9gmfg,StatusCranberry,I (32M) turned my life around thanks to my (34F) gf. I owe her everything I have but I found out she’s cheating on me. She doesn’t know I know. Need help.,"I don’t even know where to begin I can barely process everything I am feeling right now. I have been with my gf for 4 years now, I  always thought this would never happen, that cheating “wasn’t her” or that it didn’t fit her personality. I feel so blindsided and to be honest that’s probably the worst part, the feeling that I have been duped. In most cases I think cheating should have a pretty obvious solution, I should just tell her and break up with her but what makes this so hard is I OWE MY LIFE to this girl.

We met in 2015, I was at a VERY low point In my life. It sounds dramatic but its tough to phrase it any other way besides she had “rescued” me. She always hates when I say that but it is true. I’m a college dropout who wandered aimlessly around life for most of my 20s. I'll save you the specific details because thats not the main point here, but when I realized I was completely wasting my potential in life I turned to drugs and alcohol, and my downward spiral began. I couldn’t pass a drug test or stay sober long enough to be motivated to apply to jobs. I had inherited a condo and some money from my mother who passed away and my daily life consisted of waking up, getting drunk/high closing the blinds and watching netflix while the world passed me by. I couldn’t even tell you what I watched, I guess maybe having the sound on made me feel subconsciously like I was still connected to the outside world in some way, pathetic. My new found taste for drugs and booze had me blowing through the money fast enough so that I couldn’t even pay the taxes on the property. In my darkest hours I would sometimes imagine that I would just default on my bills and when the police/whoever finally came to take condo away I would just take my own life and end it all. 

The liquor store was just a short walk form my condo, and I’ll never forget the first day I saw her. It was like seeing an angel for the first time. She was there buying wine for a dinner party, dressed to the 10s. She looked indecisive as to what to get, being a former bartender (and of course alcoholic) I knew my way around a liquor store. It was like the universe was serving me up a miracle, a beautiful girl who alone and an excuse to talk her. A few years ago I would have froze in fear and probably just went home, but if there’s one plus to being drunk all the time is good for is that it really has a knack for taking away any social inhibition. I tried giving her advice on wine, she later told me was confused as to wether or not I worked there or If was I was just hitting her on her, she asked if I lived in town, I lied and I said I was just visiting but I would be moving here soon ( I was afraid of her asking to see my place right then and there and she would see my apartment which with drugs, booze, dirt laundry and garbage everywhere) She said “maybe I can help you with that” and handed me her card, she was a realtor. 

I was confused if she was giving her card so I could ask her on a date, or if she just wanted a professional connection. Whatever it was it was the highest point I’ve had in the last 6-7 years probably. This beautiful women wanting to talk to me, it sounds pathetic but it was a huge deal for me. That night I went home I spent all night stalking her social media (lol) trying to map out my next move, reliving the conversation with her in my mind, picturing her smile as she looked in my eyes, I was so obsessed that I realized I hadn’t even had a drink that night yet! (Which didn’t last long but was a small omen of what this girl would do for me)

I eventually text her and we meet up for coffee, we hit off completely and it was like something out for a romance movie the way we were clicking. We had the same sense of humor, same interests, same hobbies the only glaring difference between us being she was a very successful realtor and here I was a depressed alcoholic/drug addicted / suicidal low life.

For the first time ever though I had a reason to want to clean me apartment, I couldn’t let her see it in the shape that it was in as it would be too embarrassing. I know it seems silly to some but I remember cleaning the apartment being the first thing I “accomplished” and felt good about. I now had a clean apartment and a beautiful girl on the way over to spend time with me. I remember feeling like ""Wait a minute,  am I normal person in society now? Does this mean I have life?""  I was still drinking, trying to be discreet about it and brushing off her comments like “there’s always a bottle in your trash” or “why do they know your name at the liquor store?”, or “your breath smells have you been drinking?”  You can brush off a question or two at first but each subsequent one raises suspicion and eventually she got tired of me swatting them away. She came right out with it “I think you’re an alcoholic and I think you’re hiding it from me.” I caved and told her everything, that I was running out of money, that my life was a mess, that I was failure and that I didn’t even have a job. I cried like a baby and I was sure she would leave me the next day, after all I've already lied to her so much, but we were in a fairy tale I didn’t and I didn’t want it to end. 

She told me either I commit to getting professional help or she doesn’t want to see me anymore. She was only the good thing in my life in past......well seemingly forever, so I would do whatever I had to in order to keep her. She signed me up for AA, she held me accountable to attend every meeting, even driving me there herself many times. Most importantly she cared about me. I think that single thing alone gave me the strength to actually get through the program. Actually I know it did because I would of never gone to it in the first place without her, and now not only was I going to it but I had an actual reason to finish, because I didn’t want to lose the only source of happiness I’ve encountered in my adult life, which was her.

So on top of getting me sober, she also wants to help me get employed again. Unfortunately bartending is really the only marketable skill I have, but obviously not a great route for a recovering alcoholic. I’ve always wanted to start my own business and she even paid a decent amount of money for me to take this online course about digital marketing. I don’t think she even thought it would it would work, I think she just wanted to see me commit myself to something, I dove head first into it and consumed all the content I could and low and behold I was soon making money. I think one nice thing about being an addict is you truly know what It means to obsess about something, and so I became obsessed with digital marketing, and because of that I got good at it, really good at it to the point I was able to make a full time income.

Ive now gone from suicidal/alcoholic low life to someone with a beautiful GF, sober, and earning an honest living. My gf was the one who came into my life, who got me into AA, and who paid for me to learn Digital marketing. I have done a COMPLETE 180 in life, I’ve gone from the darkest mental place I can imagine to a fully functional happy healthy member of society with is own business is starting to get real traction, if it wasn’t for her, I honestly may have never made it out of that dark time in my life, so you can imagine how highly I hold her in that regard.

Last weekend I sent her a text message letting her know I was really excited about a new client I had just landed. A few hours go by and no response, very out of the ordinary for her but whatever no reason to over react yet right? Well a few hours later I call her and it goes to voicemail. I know you're probably thinking I'm already over reacting at this point but believe me when I tell you this is very unlike her. I was more worried about something having happened to her than I was being cheated on, because I never even considered that a possibility from an angle like her. Why would she raise me from the dead only to cheat on me? A few more hours pass and I still hear nothing. Now I’m worried. Maybe I was wrong to do this but I decide to drive by her house just to see whether or not she’s home, it had been 8+ hours since I heard anything from her, she usually texts me back within 15 minutes, and NEVER will ignore my call, even when she’s busy. Well as I look down her driveway I see another car parked right behind her car is a green Ford Explorer. At this point I don’t know whose car it is yet, it could be a friend or family member for all I know. I try to not panic or overreact, I can’t confront her on it because then it would look like I was spying on her, so I just went back home, tried to stay calm and waited to hear from her. The next she texts me “Hey sorry I had really long day yesterday and went to bed early, congratulations on the new client I’m so proud of you!” Obviously this raises suspicion because her excuse for not talking to me doesn’t at all address the fact that she had a visitor, but still nothing has been proved yet. 

So now here’s how it goes from bad to worse. That same afternoon I'm at the gas station and go inside to get buy a drink (non-alcoholic), by coincidence I see her ex boyfriend in the gas station buying some things too, I don’t know if he knows who I am, but I know who he is because of some old pictures of him and her on social media and I could recognize his face. I watch him walk out of the station and get into his car and this is where my heart stops, he gets into a green Ford Explorer, there was no doubt in my mind it was the same exact one I had just seen in my girlfriends driveway the night she “went to bed early:” Now this hurts but my mind is still trying to think of every excuse I can for her so it doesn’t hurt. 

That night she comes over, she told me that I seemed “off” (of course I did) but I still didn’t want to confront her yet because at this point I still don't have any hard evidence and would have to admit that I drove by her house which could be seen as an invasion of privacy, and perhaps it was. She falls asleep on my couch that night with her phone suspiciously face down on the coffee table, her phone vibrates and I can’t help but flip it over to see who it is, of course its her ex. She is literally asleep on my lap at this point, I know her password because she willingly gave it to me a while back to play music on it, and again I know its wrong for me to be invading her privacy but my curiosity has gone way too far now and I can’t turn back. I open it up and don’t even have to read the whole conversation, the text from him will be forever burned into my memory, I can see every pixel as clear as day it read “you were wild last night, if felt like old times” followed by a kissy face emoji. I couldn’t even stomach reading the rest, I simply closed the phone and went into my room and closed the door and proceeded to have a mental breakdown. She still doesn’t know I read it, and I wonder if she is at all confused about the fact that she never got a notification for that text message because I already opened it for her, but she can’t really ask me if I opened the message form her ex bf so who knows.

She went back to work the next day, asked me if everything was alright and I told her my mind is just on my business, which is a fair excuse because I do go somewhat distant every now and then to work on my business and she understands that. The problem is I am still so hurt yet still so in love with her which is the hardest part. I haven’t even confronted her on it yet and to be honest there’s a part of me that doesn’t even want to, a part of me that just wants to go back into my fairy tale where my angel saved me from despair, got me off alcohol and kick started a life changing business opportunity. I can’t even believe someone who has done this much  for me could turn around and go behind my back and do something this low to me. In less than 24 hours my little angel has gone from having sex with her ex to falling asleep on my lap. It feels like such a punch in the stomach. I don’t even know if I can confront her about it, or if I can keep my life together without her. I even thought about just looking the other way out of fear of falling back into a life of drugs and booze without her. Getting cheated on is bad but being a suicidal loser was worse. Also I’ve started to do very very well with my business and I always imagined taking that money for her and I to start a life together, I almost feel like I “owe” it to her for considering I would of never even been able to learn the business if she didn’t help me by paying for the course and then believing in me to act upon it. I haven’t seen her since, and I don’t want to yet because I honestly have no idea what I' going to do, what I'm going to say, if even anything at all. Any help, or sense of direction, of the right/wrong way to act at this point would be very appreciated. Sorry for such a long post I guess that enough for now. I can try to provide some more detail if anyone wants it. But some advice would be great.

TL;DR Love of my life got me sober, helped me start a business, turned my life 180 degrees around but now she’s cheated on me. 

UPDATE #1: Thank you for all the responses, and especially thank you for the support. I still havent confronted her on it, been mostly avoiding her. I still don't know what im going to do yet. I have at least decided i wont just forget about it and pretend it never happened. I guess im going to have to confront her about it but, ill update again once ive gotten through more of the comments and up come up plan, but for those who care enough about what happens know that im reading your comments and will keep this updated.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE #2: Just to let everyone know im going to see her later tonight. I guess I'll be confronting her and cutting things off. At least i have other things going for me in life now than i did before we met to keep me sane. Hopefully i have the strength to stick to my guns. Wish my luck ya'll, will give one more update after conversation is over.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE#3: Probably my final update. She came over last night and i basically said the other night you were sleeping on my lap  i saw the text from you ex,  first she started telling me i invaded her privacy,  i basically stuck to my guns that whatever i did is no where near what she did to me, she asked me if I was breaking up with her and i just said i think its best if we take some time apart (kind of a wimp answer i wish i was stronger and just said yes) She even hit me with the ""you know i love you after everything ive done for you"" which did make me feel guilty but i tried to keep reminding myself what everyone on here said about giving myself my own credit for getting clean and not defaulting all of it to her. She started crying pretty had when she realized i wasn't going to budge, but no matter how sad she looked i just couldnt get the fact out of my head that she was in bed with her ex less than a week from this very moment, she eventaully left in tears, sort of in a way that i believed she was trying to bait me into being like ""wait! stop!"" and im not going to lie it took a lot for me to let her go but i did. She texted me today and said she wants to talk, i havent replied, i dont think im going to. She knows i have a soft heart and she probably thinks im going to cave. It hurts to live with this pain and getting over it is going to suck, but it cant be harder than stopping drinking and i did that so, it definitely gives me confidence there. Also i have my business to pour myself into and distract myself which will be a way healthier outlet than booze, so i think as long as i can do that im confident i can stay on the right path. Part of me is actually pretty excited to re enter the dating world because itll be the first time i actually do it with a little self esteem lol God its going to be hard to trust anyone after that though. Ill probably be pararnoid about being cheated on forever. Thtas going to suck. Thank you all for the words of advice. Its amazing a guy can feel lonely one minute turn on reddit and all of sudden have over 100 people giving him support. Pretty unblievable.

846,c9tipb,bautistablanks,New redditor: Me (24m) and roommate (21f),"Ok so I don't know how to do this but I will just start talking and hope for the best, last year I moved into a flat and started up a friendship with one of the roommates there we would hang out quite a lot and i kinda started to feel attracted to her but then they ended up moving away and we remained friends over Facebook and Snapchat etc and those feelings I had for them faded away, near the beginning of this year I decided to invite her to live with us again as she was looking to move back to our part of the country, when it came time to move in with us I found out she had started a relationship of sorts with a guy from the other city she moved to, didn't bother me I was happy she had someone she did mention some concerns she has about this relationship though, me and her have been getting closer over the last few months we often cuddle on the sofa or sleep in each others beds and look after each other when the other is ill, was going great until suddenly i found myself having feelings for her again, I decided to tell her that I was having these feelings because I felt it would be weird for me to keep it quiet and be this close with them and she informed me that when we had lived together before she had had a massive thing for me and referred to it as a missed chance. I would have been fine had I told her about my feelings and she had shot me down but knowing that she also had feelings for me has thrown me through a loop and I don't know what to do, I feel like I missed my chance to be with this amazing person but then she now also says things about what would happen if she decided to date me, what do I do here, i'm beyond confused because some of the things shes said indicate an interest but also she's in a long distance relationship that I don't want to step on. Should I talk to them more about this? any and all advice appreciated.",2019-07-06 13:20:31,7,8,relationship_advice
847,ca0fta,BredSpy,"Recent break up,not sure what to do next","This past Wednesday,my girlfriend ended our relationship. We were only together for a month after knowing each other for a few weeks. We fought occasionally over stuff that I would say or do. I would bring up my exes or my past and she would call me out on it. She messaged me breaking up with me and saying that we have problems that we both need to work on and that ultimately we'll end up together again because we love each other. Then today she responds back to me saying that I need to work on my problems before any of this means anything. She told me that she won't go after anyone else because it took her awhile to even trust me. I'm still worried that someone else will come along. I honestly just don't know what to do. I love her more than anything and don't want to lose her. I know that she loves me too and doesn't want to lose me.

849,c9y05n,shebulust,Colleague &gt; Friend &gt; FWB &gt; Lover &gt; Stranger,"Hi. It's after many discussion with her, I'm sharing my problem here. It all happened in 10 months. 

I'm [M23] Indian Muslim, and she [F21] is Indian Hindu working in my office. We joined at the same time and we became very very close friends. Most of our views and opinions were exactly same. She loved to talk with me and started to share every thing related to her, family and friends etc. I'm a good listener and used to be a mini friends therapist for many of of besties. Gradually we became addicted each other and she started sharing her family issues and all depressions like stuffs to me as we became that much close. 

We used to text almost 95% time awake. And we used to tell and admit we both love each other but we both don't want to take it to the next level. But we started talking about sex too. She was virgin and I wasn't. I was in a long term relation which finally ended up nowhere and that was over when I joined my office and met her. So we shared all those things and we discussed about sex entirely as she was not at all aware about things. Yeah she didn't watch porn that time. This ended up like sexting even if she don't masturbate but I use to. She was only learning things. Both of us were 100% sure about that we cannot make rhis relation to a marriage considering our typical sound Indian culture, religion, and ofcourse parents. But we couldn't control our feelings for each other. 

We started going for dinner dates, empty places to hold hands and talk hours, parking lots, parks etc. This chances made us to go physical too. But we didn't try intercourse, but yeah more intimate physical fun together. This made us much more addicted. 

***HERE COMES MY PROBLEM...*** 
Finally she started showing some indications like she don't want this kind of relation. She started feeling like she is being dishonest to her parents. She even asked me 3,4 times whether we are doing good or bad things and whether we need to stop as we both are sure this love and sex not gonna last long than 1,2 years and later we will have to split and she will get married to someone else her parents decide. BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE THIS LOVE AND OFCOURSE SEX TOO which was almost close to intercourse stage. 

She gradually started cancelling our dates, outings. Gradually reduced texting. All with reason that sometimes she is like this and she needed her space and time. 

And then I started reacting for treating me like this all of a sudden. Like asking her everyone why she is like this and all. 

Finally once she told me all of a sudden, we have to breakup. We both know this is not gonna work out, this dates outings sex sext and all making her guilty, not honest to parents, bad girl, and she is living always in fear due to this kinda life. And she said she is sure about her marriage and new life which will happen within a year so she want to stop our relation and come out of love thing and cool down to make her ready for a real marriage life like her parents wish. YEAH SHE SAID THIS. The one with whom I spent very intimate and intense love moments. 

I couldn't accept this. Or digest this. She promised me we ill be besties like we were before affair thing, we'll go out and all but no sex sext and love thing. I accepted for that time but she started keeping me away, stopped texting me at all, insta, whatsapp, snapchat everywhere I BECAME A STARNGER for her. Atleast from my point of view. I tried many times talking about this thing but she becomes angry and rude saying she want time and space to bring her out of love and make her ready for even friendship with me. 


I CANNOT STOP THINKING OF HER. THE ONE WITH WHOM I TEXT ALMOST 95% TIME AWAKE. WITH WHOM WENT DATING OUTING AND ALL. WITH WHOM SHARED ALMOST EVERYTHING EACH OTHER. I CAN'T SHE SMILING AND LAUGHING WITH EVERYONE ELSE BUT NOT EVEN CONSIDERING ME. I CAN'T DIGEST ANYTHING. TRIED IN FORMING THIS HER MANY TIMES AND SHE KEEPS SAYING STOP BEGGING FOR HER AND STOP COMPLAINING AND MOVE ON. SHE ADMITS SHE MISS ME AND LOVE ME BUT SHE SAID SHE IS STRONG IN HER DECISION OF BREAKING UP THIS HOPELESS FWB KIND RELATION AND THE DECISION IS GOOD FOR BOTH OF US. 

This all happened in 8-9 months. 

Even she got point. I can't digest and move on that quickly as she is doing. My side of breakup is not as easy as her side I think. MOREOVER, I'M A HIGHLY SENSITIVE PERSON AND ALMOST AN INTOVERT. She was my bestie in town. My everything. She made a hell of lonliness and emptiness in me. Tried talking evrything. She is fed up of me requesting to consider me as best friend. She is telling she won't be able to control and will again fall to FWB or love so she don't want to take risk so she want time and space.

How this weak emotional piece of shit gonna come out of this? Please kindly suggest. Can't block her / stories / statuses / snaps. Tried but can't. Can't.

How will I convince myself that better relation will come and I won't be left lonely and fucked up forver. How will I mske myself be okay seeing her smiling and laughing in her life and with her friends while I always miss her and always in grief.

850,c9wh0a,spacejunk444,"I (29M) am in love with a girl who I think has BPD (28F). We go through cycles where her and I have great times, then she ghosts me and refuses to talk to me. xpost from r/BPD","Very long story, she is actually my ex. We were in the same grade in high school and dated when we were 17-19 back in 2007-2009. I've made a couple reddit posts about her: https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8tjn7s/whats_something_youve_done_that_deserved_credit/e18ja1t/?context=3

https://old.reddit.com/r/self/comments/7tu3nv/i_just_escaped_the_friend_zone/

We hadn't talked from 2010 until I randomly ran in to her at university in December, 2016. After we met again, we instantly became great friends. I later realized I loved her after she started seeing another guy. He treated her like crap and she would often call me crying about things he said to her, yet also call me crying about how he won't talk to her and she loves him so much.

After a couple years of this being great friends and ghosting cycle, it all changed after this Canada Day weekend. I've constantly loaned her money over the past 3 years since she makes near minimum wage and I work a professional job. I texted her asking when she could pay back the $160 I recently lent her. This was during a case where she had been ghosting me for about a month besides asking for money two weeks ago. She replied saying she wanted to come over and bring me dinner after I got off work.

We ended up having an amazing time eating dinner and spending the night binging Netflix/Amazon Prime while constantly pausing the shows and talking. It felt like a normal happy relationship, something which I've never had since I was a teenager.

The next day she came over again. We ended up seeing a movie at the theater near my apartment, and afterwords (we were both drunk) she said I could fuck her. We kissed and walked around holding hands but never went further than that.

The next day she came over again and we had a fun time, but neither of us mentioned the kisses or the conversation we had. The following day, she just asked me to meet her at a grocery store, and I paid for about $50 worth of groceries for her. She has since ghosted me again.

I straight up know I am being taken advantage of, and I have my own mental health issues. But I just don't know what to do. I love her and that's a fact, and there's no way I'm going to say no to her. Any advice or insight is apperciated.

edit: forgot the main reason I made this post. She's blocked my number again (like she always does from time to time) but just e-mailed me asking me to e-transfer her $40 for food. Like the pussy whipped guy I'm probably going to do it.",2019-07-06 17:54:26,3,3,relationship_advice

By the way.. I am not blind to this I know I don't give her half the love Daisy gives me but for some reason I just won't hold up my end of the bargain even though she gives me way more than I deserve! BUT!

We do have the same issue with each other on different subjects of our relationship. You see she gives me all the love, attention &amp; a full belly any man would want but I can't seem to do the fair thing and return it &amp; thats because I have no motivation due to the bedroom...

We have been together for 7 years &amp; over that time we have done things a lot of couples would never give a second thought of doing. And I'm not now bored in the bedroom but I never want to just have sex which she is happy to do I am very open minded and experimental and don't get me wrong so is Daisy! I'm always asking to do even more extreme things we have already had a foursome and threesomes with 2 of my close mates but after that now being years ago I have now time to time been asking if we can have a threesome with a girl, an orgy, gang bang and meet up with other couples just like us. She has told me over &amp; over she is happy to do all of those things but she tells me she's not comfortable in her own skin anymore and wants to lose weight first no matter how many times she's called beautiful/hot and not just by me! I understand that it doesn't matter how many times Daisy gets told, she needs to feel comfortable her self.  But I'm getting very inpatient as she keeps postponing and making other excuses or leads me on, Me not having this in my relationship hurts just as much as it hurts Daisy when I don't love her the way she deserves because of this I don't have the motivation to give her what she wants because and we both just go back &amp; fourth ""i'll do this if you do that""

852,ca0ene,Interestedlycow,I'm (M23) having trouble forgiving my gf (F23)for something she said.,"I've been dating my gf for about 7 months now. During the first month of dating she got really upset and blew up on me saying things such as I knew this relationship would never work. We have different beliefs, morals, etc. I shouldn't of started this relationship because I knew it would never work out.

After working things out, things have been nothing short of amazing. We get along super well now. We have small arguments but what couples dont?

I brought it up to her about a month ago and she apologized profusely for putting me through that. She said it was wrong for me to say those things and I'm sorry for getting so angry. You mean so much to me.

My gf is the sweetest most thoughtful person ever. I had already forgiven her for what she said before but the response from the talk made me really happy.

The problem is that whenever I think about what she said before... It gives me slight anxiety. It makes me feel nervous and I feel a shortness of breath. No I don't have any medical conditions and above average in health.

How do you think I can let this go? It bothers me to no end and it's making me lose sleep at night.",2019-07-06 23:50:40,10,0,relationship_advice
853,c9thjs,WitheredFlowers,Mother (38F) overstepping my (20M) boundaries.,"My mother and I really haven't been getting along recently. She treats me like dirt while coddling my children. Yesterday she came over while I was asleep and woke me up by yelling at me. When I tried to go back to sleep, she just screamed ""Wake up!"" at me. The fuck? How does she have the right to tell me how much sleep I'm allowed to get on my day off? Then she threatened to steal equipment I need to take care of my children if I didn't do my dishes immediately. She's bossing me around as if she has any say over what I do, but I am an adult. We don't live together and haven't for almost three years. So obviously after that incident I told her to leave me alone, to stop coming over unless she's picking up the kids to watch them while I work. 

Well, this morning I wake up to a text that says she's coming over. I tell her no. I tell her no multiple times, yet she still insists she will be coming over today. I don't want to see her. I want my day off before my work week starts in peace and definitely not dealing with her. She's also bringing one of our mutual friends with her even though I explicitly told her I do not want guests over if my house isn't clean. At this point she's just ignoring my texts telling her not to come over. 

Normally I'd just lock her out, but she has a key to my house. She's technically on the lease (she co-signed with me to help me meet the income requirement as I did not have a job at the time) but has no belongings here and does not live here. 

What can I do to stand up for myself and keep her from overstepping my boundaries?

The last time i cut contact i told him i still have feelings so if he just wants a friendship, he sould just stay away and let me move on.

1 week after this he contacted me after i had blocked him everywhere and he immediately started treating me sooo well and sweet and caring. He would give me little surprises, hug me, tell me how good he feels when he is around me. 1 week ago he told me he still loves me and he will never stop loving me, but we just had too many arguments.

A few days ago his behavior changed completely after we had a small disagreement. He became really distant. Even with this distant vibe, he came by yesterday to bring me some cake and he visited me at work.

But today he called and said he wants some distance because he enjoys my company but if we stay like this he is not giving himself the opportunity to meet other people.

Was he just using the feelings i have for him so he can stay close and fill his time? Has he already met someone else and cut me off??",2019-07-06 23:46:22,9,1,relationship_advice

I’m a very social person. Especially with women or anyone femme identifying. I recently relocated to another country across the ocean. i needed a change but had a heavy support system of lovely ladies back home. My first year, I had many girlfriends. Then I met my current boyfriend. He’s lovely. I moved to London for school and to be with him. I have a couple of friends, but am heavily feeling this lack of female friendships in my life. I miss the giggles, the closeness, the talks. I could cry. I love my boyfriend, but he can’t give me what my old friends gave me. I still talk to them very often, but the phone isn’t the same thing. Of course I can make new friends, but lately I just miss my old friends so much. My boyfriend can’t immediately relocate to where I’m from, and frankly he’s not even obligated to. I feel like I’m at a crossroads. He wants me to move in but I’m afraid this will isolate me more.

Is this normal? I’ve been told you lose friends in your 20s. This is frankly heartbreaking. I don’t want to fall into a depression. I think of my late teens and early twenties with such nostalgia. I was messing around but thinking all I wanted was a boyfriend. Now I have a wonderful one and I miss the closeness of single ladies. Please help me.

TLDR: moves to another country. I have a lovely boyfriend but no close female friends. This is in stark contrast to my life before moving to another country. I feel myself getting depressed. Please help me",2019-07-06 23:46:16,5,1,relationship_advice

I think she’s playing games with me and I keep giving her excuses (in my own head and to my friends) and assume she’s trying to play with my emotions to make me more needy and give her more attention rather than the genuine sentiment between her posts. She’s posting regular social media posts (she didn’t do this previously) with a particular guy. These photos don’t suggest anything untoward - there’s no intimacy at all and there isn’t even a picture of them together, just separate and of the activities they’ve done. 

Am I stupid to think that this is purely to spite me or is that a genuine thing? I feel this guy is a rebound and she’s using him to get at me, but also get the impression he wants more.

I’m doing well with keeping my distance and improving myself since the break up (a little under a month ago) but I am feeling a bit stalkery today. I want to know what’s happening basically. I know I shouldn’t, but I do.

858,ca0btj,jessslap,I love him but have never trusted him (2 years),"
OOOF I DELETED MY ORIGINAL Hey there, this is my first post. A friend suggested that I post here to get some advice . 

He is C

I know it sounds pretty stupid, but it's a LONG story 
I have a really bad life at home.
He was my escape from all the yelling and breaking of things and years of mental abuse (by older sibling). We would go to his place and spend days with each other at a time just talking and being happy. C and I worked really well together and after about a year of that we practically lived together for a bit. 


Our relationship started 2 years ago and from the beginning it's been bad and I have never trusted C. I told C when things started getting ""intimate "" that if he was going to be with me in that way, then he needs to end it with me if he is going to be doing that with someone else.

(A the ex)
It all started with a phone call from a friend of mine , she called saying "" yeah boo get some"".  I had no idea what she was talking about. What happened was she drove by where C worked and he was holding A with his hands in her back pockets. 
It was an ex that was moving out of state and went to ""say goodbye"".... I forgave him and looked passed it. 

One night after things had been serious for a while he invited a girl over to drink and to sleep together, she went over . I never knew her name

(M is ""just a friend"")
After that we had been fighting one day then that night he invited M over to ""just hang out""  

He blew me off one night to go sit in a car  for hours at the top of the world (a spot teens go to drink and sleep together )  he said they were ""just talking "" , it was yet another female ""just a friend"" I never new her name.

Then there was a different ex (K) that he was talking to and he would block K when I told him to then, just unblock K again. 
After over a year he stopped 
 

On st. Patty's day he told me he was going to his brothers house to hang out and dodged my calls for hours and was giving me every reason he could on why he couldnt talk to me on the phone even when he was in the car with a friend (I lived with him and said friend ) finally I told him if he didnt tell me truth that I would leave him for good. He went to a party with some chick but he left his location on snapchat on.  But shes ""just a friend""  never new her name 


He has talked to his ex (J) on a regular basis ( she was a huge part of him and his families life when they were together) .He would rather have J in his life than me if he had to choose, but he says he doesnt want to be with J. They also have 20 mutual friends on Facebook out of his 80 including all his family. I havent even met his family.

About a few months ago is when I started pushing him away more and wanting him less and that's when he started doing everything he could to change. Absolutely everything. All he wants is me, has been doing the things to prove it and he has been begging me not to leave him. 
Well , the other day I said I dont know how to makes things work and as soon as we ended it he started posting pics of himself he knew I didnt want him posting and started adding other people . When I talked to him today he said if I still wanted to be with him he would delete everyone he added  and everything he posted.  I asked him if we broke up for good,  would he do that stuff and he flat out told me right away he would start talking to other females because he couldnt handle not having anyone to talk to

All of this and more and I still love him so so much and I dont know why I cant just leave him. I was supposed to be moving in with him for good. Now I'm terrified to go out on my own in a city 40 miles from where I live to get an apartment, job and college on my own. ( I currently live in a really small town that I couldnt get an apartment cheap enough to afford)

859,c9xvj1,Uhaulsanderson,Leaving in the night?,"Let me start this where I know this is a bad emotionally abusive and controlling relationship I just need the courage to finally leave(planning for in the next week and a half). My fiance F20 and me M23 Our relationship started out not the greatest it was something where I personally wasn’t the most interested in her, but she wanted me date so I decided to ask her out. Fast forward 3 months and I tried to break up with her twice already and whenever I did she lost her shit and threatened to kill herself (By taking a handful of pills and jumping off and bridge) I stopped her from doing both and told her I’d tell her parents or called 911 when I said that she said she’d actually do it. 
Below I copied some of the things she does to help with the prospective.
I did want to add that I do of course still care about her and this is my first relationship.
I also wanted to add that I was given either to propose to her or she was leaving me right after I signed a big apartment lease that I couldn’t afford myself. 

Isolation from friends and family she never lets me hangout with friends and even family without her being present. She will not let me even go to the store/gym/outside without her.

She threatens me with breaking up with me whenever she doesn't get her way.

She guilt trips me all the time into feeling bad because she ""cares"" about me so much.

She never gives me privacy she's constantly going through my phone and accusing me of stuff that I didn't do. She will also deleted every girl contact off my phone/ Snapchat.

She's overly jealous and if a girl even looks at me in public she freaks out saying that I was checking her out.

Huge one this one ties into number one which is not respecting my time alone. She wants and expects me to be with her 24/7 and never lets me do anything else unless she is along. This makes me feel like I've been suffocating for the last two years.

She doesn't respect my dreams/career choices no matter what job I try and get in my field she finds a way to not like it and wants to me find something else.

She has zero trust in me and makes me tell her everywhere I go, even if it is to the bathroom,

She presumes me guilty until I can prove her innocent. For example checking my phone if she saw that even something as small as another girl writing me Happy Birthday on Facebook she absolutely goes irate.

She gets upset when I attempt to eat healthy or exercise.

We cannot agree on a place to live together because she wants to spend $1300+ on an apartment a month where I would like to spend hundreds less and have other bills to pay off.

We both currently work from home so I literally don’t get any time away from her. I appreciate any comments and will be checking when I can get the chance and she’s not around. I think the only way to end it as bad as it sounds is to leave in the night with my stuff and block her on everything. Is this a good idea? Thank you!

860,c9xv9s,TheRoyalsapphire,My girlfriend (F19) keeps bringing up the idea of a three-way and its making me (M20) uncomfortable,"So we’ve been dating for 5 months and it’s her first relationship she’s ever had. We are super close and have a pretty strong bond with each other based on trust. 

Very early on in the relationship I told her that I was Bi-curious and sexually-attracted to men. I wanted to tell her this because in the past women I was romantically involved with were put off by the idea and I wanted to gage how she felt about her boyfriend being possibly bisexual.

She was very cool with it, said it didn’t change a thing about how she felt about me. 

We have a great sex life, both of us are very satisfied, happy, and discuss it a lot. Recently we’ve been getting kinkier and trying out new stuff with one another. 
Whenever we talk about trying new things, the group sex/three-way conversation all ways comes up, usually from her. Because I am bi-curious and she isn’t, she often suggests the idea of a MMF threeway, because another bi-man in the room would be a “win” for both of us.

At first I was keen on the idea of it, but the more I thought about it the less I liked it. The more we discussed it the more uncomfortable I got about the whole topic. 

I think im more dedicated to strict monogamy than I had previously assumed. And sex is definitely more of an emotional ordeal for me than it is for her. I just cannot feel comfortable with the idea of someone having intercourse with my girlfriend in front of me, even if I’m participating. 

In the past, when I asked her if she would be comfortable watching me have sex with another women, she said she would be uncomfortable, but yesterday I posed the same question and she said she would be fine with it.

I cannot tell if she wants this three-way to help me experiment with my sexuality or to live out her fantasies, and every time I ask she never gives me a straight forward answer.

She has a whole “don’t knock it till you try it” mentality about it, but I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t enjoy it. Does this make me emotionally insecure? Am I weird for wanting to adhere to monogamy? Is she doing this for me or herself? 

I like this girl a lot, and I’m very confused.",2019-07-06 19:55:42,5,3,relationship_advice

He got insanely jealous and hurt that while I was talking to this new person I was also talking to him. 

I would say that he and I have been great ever since that confusing time period. He and I have been together for almost a year now in September. I've never talked, seen, or met with that other guy since May. I've never talked to any guy like that besides that one guy during that time. 

He says that it just randomly pops back into his head every so often. 

He says that he wants me to give him this old dudes address to beat him up. It's Chicago and not many people are afraid to fight. Especially him. He's threatened before and has done similar stuff to other people so I know he's not gonna be fazed when he gets into trouble or anything like that. 

He says he hasn't forgived me yet. 

Is there anything I can do to make this situation better?

865,ca03ze,ExpressRaisin,Still have feelings for my ex who now lives accross the country,"A few months before college graduation, one of my guy friends told me he liked me and wanted ""spend the next few months left in college together."" At this point, he had just broken up with his girlfriend, but I thought, why not, what could go wrong, right? I ended up catching feelings. 

&amp;#x200B;

We saw each other for about three months at the end of college, and it was on and off. Mostly cuddling, sex, and pillow talk. Before then, we had been pretty good friends for almost a year, so I don't know why I thought that it would be a good idea at the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are a few reasons why I convinced myself that it would never work: like he was going to move across the country to NY, and I was staying in CA. He still had to recover from his breakup, and I didn't think it would work anyway because we were only really ""seeing"" each other for two months. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, I can't stop thinking about him. He tells me things like ""I really want to end up in California, and I see us being together..."" blah blah blah. One side wants to believe him, but if I let myself believe it, it means that I have to admit want us to be together. In addition to that, he tells me a lot of personal things that he only tells a select people, which makes me feel like he trusts me. I don't know if I should cut off communication with him even though he has told me so much about his mental illnesses and family problems, even though I find myself going crazy thinking about him all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that it has been almost a month since graduation, I still talk to him pretty often on the phone/text. He has told me things that are really vulnerable, and I just don't know what to do since he doesn't know that I still have feelings for him.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I cut him off completely? Should I tell him how I really feel? HELP!",2019-07-06 23:21:19,1,1,relationship_advice
866,ca032r,laladybelle237,Should I call off our engagement,"I am a 23F engaged to a 24M that I have been with for six years. We currently live together and have for almost a year. Sincerely he’s my best friend and I am very much interested in him romantically and sexually. In the beginning we used to be intimate multiple times a day, but it eventually leveled out to a few times a week by year 3 and that was still fine. Over the last 8 or so months it’s dropped off severely to the point where I am constantly trying to initiate sex 4-5x a week and get rejected almost every time. The very few times it works, I can tell he’s not actually engaged *with* me but for me, to the point where he does his thing for 5 or so minutes and asks if we can stop in the middle of sex. If it were up to him I’m sure he’d be fine with being intimate once a month. 

I recently asked him if he notices the difference in our sexual drives and what he perceives our situation to be. On a scale 1 to 20 he rated my sex drive as a 20 and him as a 5. I’ve talked to him time and time again about my frustrations and asked if we could expand our definition of sex whether it be masturbating together or watching pornography together (I know he still does both). He agreed, but then when I tried to initiate it later on that week he pushed it off yet again. It feels like he doesn’t take my sexual needs seriously and as much as I hate to admit it in my dreams my mind is starting to wander. He claims that he still loves me, which I don’t doubt but I don’t know that he still sexually attracted to me. I haven’t gained a great deal of weight and get regularly complimented on my appearance (saying this non-arrogantly). I have an IUD which he says sometimes pokes him, but that it’s not a big enough deal for me to remove it. At the same time he’s very excited about wedding planning and it seems to have helped him and his future groomsmen reconnect, but I just don’t know anymore. I’ve heard that sex really decreases after marriage and I don’t want to be in a sexless marriage. It’s also really beating down on my self-esteem/confidence that I have to beg my partner to be intimate with me. How could I ever explain this to our families? What should I do?

tl;dr : fiancé is excited about getting married and claims to be happy, but recently we’ve developed opposite sex drives and I can’t live like this. What to do?",2019-07-06 23:18:47,9,1,relationship_advice
867,ca02u3,throwAwayCusePPLKnow,I need a lil help.,"I met someone around 2 years back. Beginning of senior year of high school. She was nice we had mutual friends but somehow never spoke before. We talked for months and we got really close. She was smart and I absolutely loved our conversations. But I was strictly against dating. Even at the time. I always knew that I'd catch feelings so I'd usually suppress feelings for people before her. But we spoke for around 4 months. Half way into senior year now,  suddenly asked me out. After much deliberation I said yes. It was awesome. We ""went out"" for around 8 months. I say ""went out"" cuse I barely got to see her outside of school. On the weekends I'd be busy with my job (trying to save up a little for college) and during the week I was wrapped up in trying to figure out what I wanted to major in and also catching up with clubs, volunteering etc. I was insanely busy. I was an average student through high school and just wanted to get that little edge in my senior year.

I mention all this cuse she was very very understanding. She'd listen to me vent for hours and I'd listen to her. She too was very busy which made meeting her super hard. We'd text at night and see each other in the morning. Then we graduated school and I went home (I am a first gen American) to Indonesia to see my grandparents for about a month after graduating. When I came back she broke up with me. Understandably so cuse we had always decided that if we moved to colleges far away, long distance was not on the table. But we had another month together but when she said she wanted to split. After college started we continued talking. Relying on each other. But every time I'd talk to her I'd think about the old time and I'd miss her. I'd think about being with her. This messed up my personal life. I would sit in my room all day, binge watch Netflix, barely go out. I made only a few friends in my first semester. I went back for Christmas and we met again. I saw her but she acted indifferent towards me. Like I was just an acquaintance. This hurt me. It was fair that she moved on but I had just come to grasp with it. So in January I texted her that we should stop speaking completely. She asked me why and I refused to explain this to her. I figured if I was the bad guy, she'd never want to speak to me again. She'd hate me but atleast we both would be able to move on. But thoughout the second semester I kept thinking about her.

Now in the beginning of summer I spoke to a mutual friend and he said that she was mad at what I did . So I spoke to her again but she didn't wanna listen. Understandably so. She refused to talk to me and rejected my apology. Then a few days later she texted me saying 'you gave no explanation for why we stopped speaking and that pissed me off and you expected me to act you like it never happened.' Again I understand. However after I told her she understood and we decided to stay in touch but not text and call like we used to. 

The issue is that I think about her. All the time. I want a forget her but I can't. Idk what to do from here on.

Edit 1: I'm not trying to get back with her. I know it's not meant to be. I'm just asking whether it's worth pursuing a friendship or atleast making things right or should I just leddit be?",2019-07-06 23:18:14,4,1,relationship_advice

He has a gf, while a 26 year old like me is still struggling. 

Don't get me wrong I love him, but he's one of the laziest person I've ever seen. He spends the whole day enjoying the only hobby which is video games. He barely helps around the house. And everytime I ask him questions, he always says ""I dont know"". He's scared of ghosts so he's been sleeping in mom's bed for years. 

All of those made me question my selfworth. Even my brother can get girls, then I might be a less valuable person than him.


I'm graduating in Engineering next year, but man every time I think about that, I feel like giving up on my education. I tried making friends in school, but it seems like all the college folks just want to keep to themselves. The word ""friends"" just stay as long as we're in the same class.

I know I won't be happy if I do end up with him but I'd be financially well off. Advice needed,"As the title said my boyfriend and I have been dating for about 4 or so months.
We have the concept of arranged marriage in my community where dowry is quite prevalent.
I know for sure that my parents won't be able to get me married to someone like him (it'd bleed them dry) and frankly I doubt if it'd get a guy as good as him (to date or like me back).

There isn't much going for me (I'm 132 pounds and 5'4,I am not pale skinned (Pale skin = beauty, I don't support it ofc but I didn't set the standards of beauty) , and I have a crappy job).
Now this guy is  sorta good looking by standards 6ft,earns 4 times than me but has really low self esteem as he is a shade or two darker than me (he looks fine to me) and was overweight and girls treated him like shit and I didn't so he thinks I'm really great and stuff.

We do have some chemistry and we are on the same page mostly and I do care about him but sometimes I feel it's better to break things off as he isn't my true love.

I am not even sure if we'd end up married but he hinted on it. Sometimes I feel he doesn't care about me at all and doesn't love me so I want to break things off with him but I think about my future.

There is this part of my brain that's overtly romantic which wants me to breakup and find my true love, 

one part telling me that breakup would be better and I can always count on passing govt exams (which I'm studying for right now) and I'd be financially well off and wouldn't need to worry about becoming crazy cat lady, 

and the cynic part telling me true love doesn't exist and that I'm a dumb f*** and that I have watched too many movies and I should think with my brain and not my heart and not end up as crazy cat lady. 

I can't share it with anyone as they'd call me a gold digger (I'm not interested in his money as I don't plan on quitting my job anytime soon but a well educated guy sounds good to bring home to parents and he'd make a great dad). 

Also about the whole loving part, I do love him and he says he loves me too, I didn't talk to him about not feeling the relationship but he feels that it's going great and that I'm his first love and stuff and no one made him feel attractive before.

870,ca00tx,MagicalFrostyFlakes1,Relationships give me so much anxiety...,"Idk what it is but the more I read / think about it, relationships give me so much anxiety. I feel like almost everyone cheats. Doesn’t matter how young or old the relationship is, I just feel like everyone cheats and that it’s not even worth it to seriously invest time with someone when their constantly looking for someone better. 

I also read about this 7 year mark in which people get bored or fall out of love with each other and that’s so scary. Investing all that time, and putting your feelings, all joyous feelings into someone only for them to look at you and feel “meh.” 

It’s just so scary, makes me lose hope in humanity, I’m dating a guy now who is wonderful. We go on dates, show lots of affection, cook at my parents house together, and do the sex, but I don’t think there will be an “I love you.” And that’s okay for now. I can’t commit with this much anxiety about love. But one day I’ll have to get my ish together and these kind of light hearted things won’t cut anymore. And then I’ll have to get serious when all these tragic things happen between people.

871,ca00tn,sb993670,Is it wrong to not care anymore? (F19) (F20),"I’ve been best friends with this girl for years, we got along great, we like the same things, we’ve been each other’s rocks for so many different things. 

Here are the problems:

- She cancels on 99% of plans that we’ve made whether it’s coffee, coming to mine or hers, dinner, movies, just hanging out in general. She comes up with a shitty excuse but then goes out with her boyfriend or sister and posts about it. 

- I invite her to EVERYTHING, everywhere, all sorts of things and she just bails with an excuse. I work two shifts everyday early morning and afternoon and she works 2 shifts a week, I offer to come over in between my shifts even though I’m exhausted I’d still like to see her and her excuse is that she works in the evening or is tired? Why is it that I can come over when I’ve woken up at 5am and have already worked 4+ hours then work another 4 after? 

- A few weeks ago we decided to go to the gym together and I got her a discount because I work for the company. She then extended that discount to her family members (without permission) and has failed to invite me or let me know of her gym plans. The one time we actually went her sister went as well... then they ditched me the second I arrived. (I’m not comfortable at the gym and as her “BFF” she’s aware of this but left me anyways) 

- When i brought this up a few days ago she called me a liar and said that she wasn’t just using me for the discount. Then says that I’m being dramatic about her cancelling/coming up with excuses. 

- She literally never thinks of me or thinks of inviting me anywhere. I’m just non existent!

We’ve had conversations about this SO many times and she promises to change and this time she got mad and hasn’t responded. I’m feeling just tired of this and tired of being treat poorly by someone who’s supposed to be my friend. Was it wrong of me to bring this up? Is it wrong that I just don’t even want to continue this 10+ year long friendship with this person?",2019-07-06 23:12:41,2,1,relationship_advice
872,c9zynr,keanuroberto2,Realised that almost all of my relationships are pretty toxic,"Ever since my ex I’ve had to do quite a lot of soul searching. She was awful to me, abusive actually. She was totally disrespectful of me, led me on, used me, then left me without closure. She still screws with me even now. I got diagnosed with anxiety recently and I most likely have depression too. It’s not been the best few months. 

I’ve come to the realisation recently that I’ve been letting quite a lot of people into my life hah really aren’t that nice to me. 

My best friend at uni’s favourite past time is to call me autistic and put me down at any opportunity he finds. My best friend from home decided the best course of action when I told him about my abusive ex was to add her on Instagram. Even when I told him not to. My mum decided to make my issues all about her and seems to get mad at me for some reason whenever I confide in her, like I’ve inflicted pain on her or something. There’s others too but I won’t list them all. Don’t get me wrong, one or 2 friends have been real good to me about this situation. But most are pretty toxic individuals in my life. 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve let people push my boundaries to stupid levels because tbh, I never had any boundaries. I can’t just clear out all my friends can I? I have to live with some of them next year and I really don’t want to anymore. They’re just gonna make life awful for me now I’ve come to this realisation. I’m still struggling getting over my ex too because I was totally in love with her, even with the abuse. I can’t stop thinking about her and she doesn’t even think about me.  

I don’t really know where to go from here. Does anyone have any advice? Sometimes I feel like the only option is to just move away and start fresh.

873,c9zyl0,_luckybell_,Is it wrong of me [19F] to not want to be as close with my “Best Friend” [19F] as we used to be.,"Me and my “Best Friend” (we’ll call her Ann) met in religion class in our first year of high school. (Western USA). So we both had a very strong testimony of our faith. Throughout the past 5 years i have always been her best friend, but she hasn’t always been my best friend. This past almost two years i’ve started hanging out with other people, who aren’t part of Ann’s faith. I have also left our faith. I drink, smoke weed, swear, and don’t believe in God. She doesn’t know any of this: she only knows i’m not part of that faith and don’t go to church. She doesn’t know that all my friends are atheists and do the same things as me. I can’t believe what she would think if she found out the real me. She already told me that i’m a “different person” after leaving the faith.

My family adores her. My mom especially. even my grandma. My mom invited her to go to disneyland with us in a few months, before she even told me about it. I know her and my mom text, probably more often than i’m aware of. Whenever Ann and i hang out, i feel like her and my mom talk more than me and her. And whenever I am with her, I feel like i can’t tell her anything. She is SUPER against weed and drugs and alcohol, and can’t imagine a life without God. And anything i tell her she will tell my mom. Even new hobbies i have or new things i learn about, I feel like she just can’t relate to anything i tell her. Whenever we’re alone it’s just like “did you hear about [insert stupid celebrity drama]? that’s so crazy”. or “did you see [person from high school]’s instagram post? so pretty!”.  It’s just not fun for me and just not the way i want to spend the little free time i have (i have a job i’m at a lot and other friends). 

I don’t know what to do. I love her and it’s not like i never want to see her ever or that i want to cut off all contact. I just wish i could just spill all my truths and everything i haven’t been telling her, we could agree to disagree.I want her to accept my lifestyle and not think that i’m “sinning” or being “led astray”.  And i wish she could accept that we’re not best friends and that we probably never will be again. I have a boyfriend i love who i love spending time with, and a best friend who i can actually tell things to, as well as other people i’d rather hang out with and things i’d rather do.

I guess my main question is should i tell her everything? or should i just keep quiet and kind of.. drift away? I know this probably seems like an insignificant post but i would really appreciate any comments.",2019-07-06 23:06:46,0,1,relationship_advice
874,c9zxm5,Whendwegetabird,"I have to know, but I can't ask if my bf is friends with my rapist","On a throwaway because I haven't and won't report the incident, and I'm not looking for advice about that, just to be clear from the beginning. \*Trigger warning for sexual assault\*

A couple of years ago I went on about three dates with a man that lived in my town. ""Dates"" is a strong word though, because we didn't really click romantically, so it was more like just hanging out. The only real time we connected in conversation was when we were talking about a show that we both loved. He told me all about how him and his military unit watched the first two seasons a hundred times on an old laptop while they were deployed. After the last date we went on together, he dropped me off at my house and hung out for about half an hour before I asked him to leave. He had stared getting hands-y but I made it clear that we weren't going to have sex. Well, he did leave. Just long enough to go get absolutly wasted, drive back to my place, shove me inside after I opened my door, and sexually assault me repeatedly.

I haven't and won't report this incident. This post isn't for sympathy, criticism, or advice regarding that event. The backstory is to give context and because honestly it feels really fucking good to lay all that out finally. Like, really really good.

So. I've recently started an actual relationship with a new guy, and things are going great. We definitely click on all levels, it's healthy, and we see a future for ourselves together. We even have these amazing, daily, late-night phone calls on the days that we don't see each other. Last night, we talked about all sorts of interesting things, but the only part of the conversation I can remember anymore is when he talked about how him and his old army unit watched the first two seasons of that same show hundreds of times on an old laptop while they were deployed.

I had no intention of ever bringing up what happened to anyone, let alone the guy I'm seeing. I'm so lost right now on what to do, what to say.. If I even should do or say anything.. The thought that my bf might be friends with the man that raped me, might hang out with him, might bring me back into contact with him.. terrifies me. Neither of them have ever really used Facebook/social media, so I don't know how to see if they're still friends without asking my bf outright about him. But, if I ask him, he'll want to know how we know each other and why I'm asking. Even if he doesn't ask me how, there's no way I'll be able to hide how upset I still get at just the mention of the the other man's name, and that would naturally raise concern.The possibility that it's all just an insanely big coincidence is still there, too. Like, what if I do ask my bf about him, have to go through all of this with him, and it turns out that they're just two guys that had a crazy similar experience while deployed?  

I'm not worried about how my boyfriend will think of me or anything like that if he finds out about what happened. I just feel like I need to know if they're still friends (or ever were) but I also don't want my bf asking me or reaching out to the other guy with questions or to confront him or anything.  
I don't know what advice I'm really asking for here.. But I damn sure feel like I need some, if anyone had any to offer.",2019-07-06 23:04:13,3,0,relationship_advice

I need some advice and help getting over a past ex. I feel like I’m slowly falling into depression and I need help / advice  getting over her. I was in a 3 year relationship with someone I genuinely loved but as things got more serious towards the third year I decided to move in with her ( I’m from the west coast city life and her from the east coast small town ) once I got there I knew it was going to be a big change for me and  As things started to settle in and I became super anxious because it was just me and her animals and I felt super isolated. I’m used to having a lot of family and friends around and it just being genuinely loud all the time and once I got there it was eerily quite for the time. I freaked out MAJORLY. I packed up all my stuff and took a plane back to the west coast. After a few days back home I told my girlfriend at the time that I wanted to move back but I just needed some time to gather myself. Fast forward a few weeks, I ultimately decided to break things off thinking that this would be best for both of us.  Oh boy was I wrong. I legitimately can’t get her off my mind and it’s been almost 6 months. And To make things easier for her she removed me from everything in her life and told me “ Consider me moved on”   this sentence haunts me every fucking day. I can’t say I  blame her because I was so unsure what I wanted at that point. So there’s my story :/ I would love for us to get back together but I know I’ve ruined everything.  I don’t know if I’m a Man child or I just wasn’t ready for that big of a step and caused a ripple effect on everything else.

877,c9zwmt,MayaMate,My Ex cheated on her new guy but refuses to brake up,"So long story short.. We broke up 3 months ago. The Relationship lasted about 7 years. We were really bad in love, even after so long time. But the last two months everything surrounding us was getting more stressful than ever. We had difficulties with our landlord, our apartment had no heater for 1,5 months, and i started working as a habit and wasn’t really much arround her. Breaking up seemed like the only good decision for her. So we broke up. And we decided that we figure stuff out everyone on his own and stay in contact to see how we will change and if it could work out again.

The first two weeks I was totally relaxed, but after the time panic was creeping up on me. I became a total wreck, even around her. So she was more and more turned off by my behavior. I went into no contact, and started working on myself as we intended. 

I had a really hard time, moved into a new apartment. And as I thought i could move on, she contacted me. Since I had feelings for her and wanted to get back I called her. We had a lot of fun. Than she came over in the middle of thw night. We talked and had fun. But she told me she had a new boyfriend. Which she got 3 weeks after us. But she seemed sorry about it and confused about the new me. So we had sex.

The next to days she wanted to see me. But i was on my way back to the emotional wreck because I couldn’t handle it well. And so she noticed how I became more sad around her and things wasn’t so much fun anymore. I tried but couldn’t. The next day she dressed up and really tried to get my attention. But again emotional wreck. So she said its better to go no contact again. 

But I couldn’t. As i was sliding directly into the friendzone, we had sex 2 more times.

So after all that, she still thinks its better to stay with her new boyfriend. And i dare to think about telling him. Not because I want her back in the first place, more because I would also like to know when she would have cheated on me during the relationship. Should I contact him?

TLDR: Ex broke up. Got a new boyfriend 3 weeks after. We still meet and have sex. She refuses to brake up with the guy. I want her back but also want to tell that guy what she is doing, which could ruin my chance but is the only right thing to do now. So here the big question: what to do?",2019-07-06 23:01:26,11,1,relationship_advice
878,c9zwb8,Humanssuck93,Discovered that my boyfriend watches and follows cam girls - should I be ok with it?,"So I discovered today that my boyfriend watches cam girls and it has made me really sad. I noticed that he follows one on twitter and not even just on her NSFW account but also her personal one aswell. I confronted him and he said ""Yeah and? You know I watch porn sometimes. It's no different to that"". In my opinion watching a couple have sex in a studio is very different to watching a girl in her bedroom riding her dildo calling the viewers daddy. We used to have a very healthy sex life but the last 4 months it's been virtually non existent - bar one occasion when we were drunk and another which lasted for literally a couple of minutes and no foreplay was involved whatsoever. Other than that it's been absolutely nothing. Zilch. He never wants it. He claims it's not me. He claims he still fancies me but ""doesn't know what's wrong with him"". I asked him a while ago if he is still wanking and he said ""barely"" and that it was not for pleasure but more a case of ""just getting the job done"". So to find out that actually he is wanking over these girls online makes me feel so worthless and ugly and wondering what do they have that I don't? 

He claims that he followed this particular girls Twitter accounts ""the other night"", which means he did it when he was with me, which makes me feel even more shitty about myself - the fact he's looking at photos and videos of these girls with me sat next to him. He claims he's never messaged anyone or paid for anything and just watches the free stuff, even if this is true it still makes me feel so uncomfortable and upset and I question why he masturbates over them but not over his actual girlfriend/over sex with his girlfriend? The fact that he has favourites that he watches makes it worse to me, like he has his ""go to girls"" if he wants a wank and it's not just whatever random videos happen to pop up on PornHub. It's specific girls. And ones that don't have many subscribers/followers either so very possibly attainable.

He admitted that he has ""no business"" following this girls personal account but he doesn't see anything wrong with following the other one or watching cam girls in general and is now angry at me for bringing it up. I asked him what websites he watches them on and he refused to tell me because he said it's personal which I also find very weird, like he's trying to hide something.

Am I in the wrong or is it perfectly acceptable to feel so upset by this?",2019-07-06 23:00:39,10,1,relationship_advice

I am really not sure whether he is into me or not because he is giving me some mixed signals. He does try to make conversation but im not sure whether it’s because he is just a talkative person or because he wants to have a conversation with me. Sometimes he will snap me back all day, and usually pretty fast, meanwhile other times he will open everything i send and not reply for days. Earlier this week he asked me if i wanted to hangout and we made brief plans to, but unfortunately they fell through. I did decide to try and drop hints because i can’t flirt. i told him i thought he was cute, and he said thank you. after i said no problem he said ‘you are too’ but i can’t help but wonder if it was maybe because he was trying to just be nice since i said it about him. 

I have pretty bad social anxiety so i’m not sure what else i could say to him. i’m not a bold person, i don’t think i would be able to be super straight up and tell him i like him. Is there any more subtle ways i could flirt or bring up things that hint towards me being into him? possibly things that wouldn’t be too awkward or if it doesn’t go my way, could get myself out of. even just conversations to bring up or things to say to him

We used to talk a lot, he’s pretty introverted and that left me to start most of our conversations. It was really fun in the beginning (5 months ago) but a few months back I felt really drained having to drive our conversations. We talked about it and decided that I don’t have to do that anymore. Now we don’t talk and when we do, it ends really fast. He will answer questions I ask and ask me the same question and that will be all. I have shown interest in his interests but that doesn’t lead to anything. I know that he does talk for a while with his friends and he enjoys that so I know he isn’t simply silent.    


We don’t talk much when we hang out in person, we just do whatever activity we pick until one of us has to go. If we do talk it is just question response question response. I’m getting frustrated and don’t know what to do. I miss talking with him but it feels like pulling teeth. I wonder if he’s trying to signal something but nothing seems off to me.

885,c9zt43,StillLife17,"I (17M) am outrageously spiraling out of control in all aspects of my life, especially in the aspect of the relationship I have with my girlfriend (17F) of 2 years 5 months. I desperately need some sort of help.","The first thing to mention is that the topics discussed are absolutely not to be talked about with any family, that being said, I'll start at the beginning.
I love my girlfriend beyond what is possible. She is everything to me. I would do everything for her. She loves me too, and is the same way. Honestly, she is my fiance, I proposed to her in the first 5 months of dating. However, with this promise to marry her I also have promised never to marry her until 22 as O have had an abusive childhood due to my alcoholic mom. I wanted to wait until I was through my frist year of being legal to drink alcohol. I drink little to none. No more than a couple sips of whiskey or beer in the past 3 years. She understands, we would prefer not to spend money on divorce if potential alcohol issues led to breaking up.
Furthermore, we lost our virginity to each other, used to have phenomenal sex, varying from the most passionate lovemaking to things much much more, intense.
In almost every aspect of life, the future, death, philosophy, children, and family we support each other and pretty much fully agree on everything.
This girl, woman, whatever she is, it doesn't matter, she is unrealistically perfect. She says I'm perfect, although we both disagree on ourselves being perfect and constantly say we don't deserve each other. She is my best friend, and I, hers. We were best friends for a while before dating and have known each other for well over 3 years, not quite 4.
All of this mind, I must now proceed to specifics of our life together.
We met during a relationship break I was having which came to be a year and a half before I asked her out. The previous girl I wasn't in love with, and despite caring about her very much I wasn't extremely hurt when I broke up with her, although I didn't really want to, and can't fully explain why I did. I do feel bad, and it did hurt badly. However I was much more reflective of myself and how I treated her than I was upset at the situation. Between breaking up with her and asking out my fiance I attempted suicide twice due to the feeling that others were better off without me after months of contemplating the idea and then proceeding to cut myself for months due to feeling that I must be punished for hurting others for every little thing until I promised my fiance not to. I would count every day how much I hurt others, even over things like being in the way in the hallway. Everytime I said sorry would be a new cut later. I honestly did not do many, although I had not done every cut I meant to, deciding to only do five at a time. These cuts were long, deep, and in places no one would see. I have scarring on my shoulder, chest, and a few scars on my arms.
After hospitalization for attempted suicide, I turned into a person who only longed to help others, deciding that despite the pain I caused others, and my conviction that they were better off without me, I would change this, become as perfect as possible, help everyone I can, even at the expense of my own suffering. I proceeded to suffer greatly for this decision, having countless nights of no sleep and emotional pain for those I had talked to and attempted to help, while refusing to ever talk about my own problems. I realized months ago that this wasn't fair and honestly cruel. I would become such a positive person to many individuals, helping them, building a relationship, and then not reciprocating their openness and trust was not being a true friend. This went on for months until one night, I briefly flirted with who is now my fiance. Now she tells me she had a massive crush for as long as she knew me, thinking I was the sexiest guy in the world, she was always looking at me, always blushing when thinking of me, and had some fun thinking about me in um, pretty cool ways, if you know what I mean. Despite this, I never noticed, and being the most quiet person I've ever known, I never picked up on this through the little conversation we had over a very long span of time.
She first arrived at my school, which she had arrived to with a handful of other new students, all arriving because our highschool would have completed construction that year and high school classes were temporarily held in the gym and portable buildings. When she arrived, due to my relationship break, I immediately began thinking relationship thoughts for the first time in months, she was gorgeous, and so wildly unique compared to every girl I'd ever met, she still is such a girl. Angry at myself, I shut down these feelings immediately, this supression was secured upon the reveal that my best friend had a crush on her. I wouldn't think relationship thoughts about her for months aside from the occasional hiccup. It is worth mentioning that I was the most polite and reserved dude I've ever known. I made every effort to strictly make eye contact with girls. Not that I cared or thought sexually of such anyways, besides from my fiance, I was only interested in a couple of girls in the past few years, but no one at the time being discussed. I just wanted to be a good guy and scolded myself for accidents (times where boobs or butts of any gender come in your direct line of sight despite all effort for the prevention of this).
Fast forward a year later, right before school began, for some wildly unknown reason that I will never find out, the best friend previously discussed sent me a random text saying we weren't friends and to stop talking to him. I told him I wish I understood why he was saying that, and if he wants to talk about it or be friends again I'm here, but alright, I'll see you around. When the school year began, things between myself and who is currently my fiance changed. Whereas I previously genuinely thought that she actually hated me, like thought I was annoying and an idiot and everything, it became apparent that she was comfortable around. Her and myself had hung out a few times with friends, for me it was primarily to be a wingman to my previous best friend until she had hardcore hilariously rejected him the previous Valentine's Day. For her apparently, she had another guy on her mind, another reason for hanging out and rejecting my best friend... Me, Myself, and I.

I apologize due to the length of this post, I feel it is necessary due background to how hard this next part is going to be. The rest will be discussed in a part two.

&amp;#x200B;

So as the title suggests, my girlfriend's dad was diagnosed with terminal illness (no more details than that) about 3 months ago. It was very sudden, almost out of nowhere, and my girlfriend being the only child is taking full responsibility in taking care of him. We were living together for the past 2 years (been together 4), but since this event, she went back to living with her parents about 2 hours away from the city we live in. I've been doing my best in doing whatever I can to support her, asking her what she needs and things like that, but because of the distance, my work, etc, I can't help out as much as I could if we were closer physically. Details aside, we don't know how much time her father has left, so it was agreed that she should spend as much time with her family as possible. She's not working currently, so it was an easy and convenient solution.

&amp;#x200B;

She'll drop by our house sometimes as most of her belongings are here, but things aren't really the same, which I understand fully. We'll cook together and eat, but she's mostly very quiet (very unlike anything in the past 4 years we've been together). I'll ask if there's something she wants to watch and she'll just say ""I just want to eat."". I try to make conversation and I'll get half replies or one word answers most of the time. I understand that different people grieve differently and she has a lot of pressure on her, so I don't want to put more stress on her. I know she's still crying about the possibility of losing her father everyday. I want to be by her side no matter what. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that as supportive as I try to be, and to be the partner I want to be for her (I want to marry her in the near future), it gets really lonely sometimes. I know I'm being selfish, but I do miss the romantic parts, the surprises, the laughter. I know I shouldn't be thinking about myself right now, but it's really hard not to be a bit hurt when she can be so cold and puts up a wall with me in her grieving process. I don't want to worry her or cause her stress, so I don't talk about it to her, but I feel like this sadness inside of me is building up more and more, and one day I might explode at her which I want to avoid. I know her problem is gigantic compared to my own loneliness.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I fix my perspective on this? I don't want to be selfish, and I want to be the best support for her, but there's also this part of me that is so lonely I'm screaming for help inside. I don't want to stress her more than I already have. I should be the one she can rely on, not piling on more problems for her. I know we love each other so much, but I'm having a hard time adjusting to this dynamic change in our relationship. It's not a loneliness that I want to be with someone, but I just miss her. I feel like shit everyday from guilt, and I don't know how to make it better.

894,c9ujkg,quartersmartt,I want to do something for my girlfriend that i once did for my ex. I don't know what I should do or if I'm overreacting.,"Hi guys. Quick backstory on my ex \[19, or.. 20 now? M\]:

We dated for about 9 months in our senior year. We broke up in aug 2018 and are on distant, not-friends-anymore-but-care-for-each-other's-beings-terms. His gaming rig consisted of a shitty laptop that only ran league of legends. About a month or two into us dating, I \[18 F\] offered him to use my old gaming laptop instead because I had upgraded to a PC. From that point he'd use my laptop instead of his for the remainder of our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

My current girlfriend \[19 F\] of 4, almost 5 months, also has a shitty gaming rig. She has a terrible laptop in her home town that she uses, and just a MacBook when shes back in-town for college. I thought about offering her my gaming laptop about 2 months into us dating, but I immediately got these feelings of confusion and fear of her thinking I was using her as a placeholder for my ex. Since I had done the exact same for my ex-boyfriend. So I didn't offer, despite knowing how much she loved video games and she was stressed with school, so video games would have been a good thing to distract her from her daily stressful and demanding days. Thinking and writing about this now, I feel like I should have. But something inside me is reeling me back from doing so because I don't want her to think that I'm trying to relive something I once had with my ex. I'm not. I just mentioned it last night because we were talking about frame rates an stuff while we were playing Overwatch. And I mentioned my laptop and she gave me a playfully shocked tone asking why I never said anything about it for the 4 months we've been dating. I know it was a fun question, but that question honestly poked at my guilt. I really wanted to! I was just fearful of her seeing it the wrong way.

&amp;#x200B;

I know my girlfriend will probably never know about the laptop-lending i did for my ex, but that doesn't mean I should just do it. If I assume she'd feel like she's being seen as my ex and not her, and I still do it because she will never know, then that'd be disrespecting her. And I'm not for that.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like.i made this much more than it actually was. So finally, the question:

I don't know what to do. Are my feelings for this puny situation too complex? Am I overthinking it? Am I blowing this up? Would she feel the way I'm afraid she'd feel if I told her? Is what I'm doing wrong ? (not offering the laptop) Am I reliving something through her if I do that? I just want to fix something for her if I can.. And I can, I just don't want to hurt her feelings or be left with some guilt in me for doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi guys wanted to let yall know that I did it and to dissapoint all of you if I got rejected but I feel pretty good. I got everything off my chest and there was no awkardness and I didn’t feel weird at all. She was cool about it and I’ll post a few keypoints :

1. The first thing she said was even if she wanted to be with me she wouldn’t get in a relationship now because in about two weeks from nowshe’ll be traveling for the next two months (imo good and fair point)

2. She said that she feels a connection between us and that things clicked pretty fast

3.  She said that she isn’t looking for a relationship right now and feels like she’s awful at dating 

4. (Most important one by far) She told me because it’s a no now it doesn’t mean it will be a no in the future when she comes back. I asked her if that’s true and to not give me false hope because I really don’t need that and she replied: “ It’s a no now and as it’s a no in the future right now, but I can’t tell if that will change or will I maybe fall for someone else, the light isn’t green and the light isn’t red”.

Everything is kinda blurry (it was a 40minute talk and I tried to focus on everything but I think I was kinda stunned with the rejection) to me so if I remember anymore keypoints I’ll put them in the edit.

I feel good, better than I expected had a few long talks with my closest friends and they were all stunned with the outcome lol. I think I maybe haven’t processed it yet and I may hit a lower point soon but again for now I feel surprisingly great. 

This is the thing that has me in a dilemma. I won’t feel awkward talking to her (not sure about hanging out with some mutual friends because everyone knows everything about what happenedes before and today), but I’m not sure I can do it with the will I use to have. Everything was natural, it didn’t feel like a task but at the end of the day I had motivation for all that. I feel like I can go on with my life and have casual fwb relationships in the meanwhile (that’s all I did for 2-3 years inbetween my last relatioship and this girl ) while I hope she changes her mind, but I don’t want to get my hopes up or think about her too much to get dissapointed in the end.

I’ll get through this don’t worry, thanks for all of the support in the comments on the first post but I need help with what you do about this is you was in my place?",2019-07-06 22:34:49,2,1,relationship_advice

&amp;#x200B;

**The background** 

Three years ago in 2016, I (then 24M) met a woman (then 42F) at a local meetup group. It is mostly academics and foreign workers who want to improve their English and socialise a bit. I met many cool people there, and developed some acquaintances. In that same summer she invited me to a conference related to a subject I am interested in. It was close to my work at the time, so I thought that I might as well go. I found her attractive, so I am not going to pretend that this wasn't a factor in my decision. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing led to another, and we had sex. This is not something I normally do (I barely have any sexual experience/experience with sexual relationships). I felt like it was foolish at the time, and made it clear just before that I was not looking for anything serious or a committed relationship. She said it was okay, but it was all a quick exchange as we were getting into it. I ended up staying the night at her hotel room and going to work the next day. I indulged myself in her company for the next couple of days, then I saw her off as she went back to her country. My thoughts at the time was that she was a nice person, and I wanted to stay friends, but not have any further sexual relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

A while later (I don't know how much later), she told me she was in love with me. And I felt very bad for it, because I did not feel the same way. We continued to message each other - she has a habit of writing very long messages, sharing about her day, which I don't mind that much. I told her once in clear terms that I was happy to be her friend, but that I did not feel the same way. Of course, she was upset as she has a right to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

She is currently doing a PhD. And comes back here for conferences. Currently, she is on an Erasmus programme in a city one hour away from me. I told myself  that to make up for what I did to her, I will be a good friend. I have edited her documents or gave her second opinions when she asked them of me. I helped set up her bank account, and apply for residency papers.  I have met up with her numerous times - going to museums,  buying her meals and drinks, because she is not doing so well with money. It seems like she is going through a lot, always, and I want to make an effort to be a good person and to be generous. She shares a lot with me, and does like to talk about anything and everything, and I try my best to listen though I admit it can be draining. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The problem** 

Essentially, she still tells me she misses me, and I make her happy. I always reinforce that I miss her *as a friend*. And always reinforce that I am a friend to her, but nothing more. When we go out, she likes to hang onto my arm as we walk, or lean on my shoulder as we sit on public transport. I don't want to brush her off because I feel like an ass-hole doing it. 

Being an hour away from her, I have made an effort to see her about once or twice a week, because if I don't make the effort she feels as if I am not putting effort in the friendship and gets upset. I am quite introverted, and even very good friends of mine are people I don't see for long periods of time. 

Recently, when we were hanging out, she told me that this other friend of hers (lets say A) wanted to meet me. She was honest in saying that she does not want me to meet A because she does not see me enough as it is. And said that she knows this is selfish thinking but could not help it. I could not care either way about meeting A - but that way of thinking is what concerned me. 

She is going through a lot (her PhD is coming to an end and barely has anything done, financial troubles, etc) and seems to be increasingly emotionally dependent on me - a guy who is not interested in taking things further. While she clearly still has feelings for me. 

I feel like that I am trapped between a rock and a hard place. Do I carry on with this? Do I distance myself? What happens if I get a girlfriend or find someone (I have been single for quite a while, and I am thinking about a companion)? Morally, I am lost. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** 

I (27M met a woman (45F) three years ago. We had sex with the understanding that there will be no serious relationship, but we will remain friends. She ""confessed her love"". I felt bad, and wanted to be a good friend. She has grown emotionally attached,  even when I have made it clear I only want to be friends. Do I carry on the friendship? Distance myself?

In this time my wife has been emotionally and physically distant.  Attempts to talk with her about it are met with dismissal or anger.  Texts/emails (her prefered method of discussion) are ignored.  4yrs ago I had an emotional sexless affair that was discovered.  immediately following the discovery we had one long talk where I explained the affair was due to me looking for a different relationship dynamic (I am a dom and only fully realized it after we we got married).  For about a month after the discovery she was more affectionate and tried to be more submissive.  I then had to go away for business for a month. When I returned the affection was gone again and she stopped being submissive. When I asked, what changed she refused to talk about it.  It has now been 4 yrs and we have only had sex 3 times and she is visibly uncomfortable when I touch her and will only kiss me if asked and then she does the awkward eye roll.

I have taken the steps to address her other concerns (anger) by seeking counseling. I have suggested couples counseling, but she has thus far not taken any steps to schedule with the counselor I found or find another.  I love her and want to save my marriage and I also don't want to lose our children.  But I have begun to think the only reason she hasn't asked for a divorce is because she is comfortable with the life she has as a stay at home mom.

901,c9zj71,whitekuda,How do I express myself after I didnt know I had feelings for her?,"Long post, might want to take some time, kind stranger!

I need some understanding from you guys here!

I knew this girl for 3.5 years now, and I am 14, and she is 13.

It all started in 5th grade where she always made jokes about us being together and would always listen to me. Then came the time where she was kind of depressed because I didn't want to be with anyone in that time. She still continued listening to everything I say and we both felt comfy when talking, playing, etc. You get the drill.

In 6th grade she was kind if getting always closer to me and it was annoying for me, as I had to study hard because you would switch schools once you finish 6th grade( in Germany I was in the Mädchenrealschule). I didn't say anything like:

""No, I dont want to be together, stop being so annoying..."",

I didn't say a single word like that, you can kill me if I did. She got a boyfriend in the mean time as the class went on. They got together mid-winter or such? I didnt mind at all. Then we would start chatting until 3 am on the weekends and fridays.

She would always tell me how her then bf was getting agressive, e. g.:

""He said how he was going to break up with me if I didnt comw to his city!"", he lived in Croatia, idk which city.

Then the day came, she cried after school and I called my parents that I would come later than usual home. I helped her break up with him, as in her own words, ge got too much of a toxic person. I helped her the whole 40-45 mins of that breaking up with him. But it was worth it, she felt much better after it.

The last day where the boys would switch schools, she hugged all the boys and said she would miss them. She hugged me last, and began crying:

""I will miss you, OP!""

I hugged her tighlty as she did me, and also said I would miss her.

The day goes by, and we all go our seperate ways.

This class, she would always send me texts about how sce cant wait to see me. I always appreciated them. Then my father fell from 4 m onto his feet.
He broke his back, his right shoulder and his left hand, about 40-60% disabled. It happened on 15.12.18 and he can still walk. I went depresso in espresso for next 4 months, but she always kept texting me and caring.

But I dont know what to do, how should i express my feelings towards her, I need some advice!

I love her as a sister,bff,friend, any relationship, but she has been fading away from me. She would reply with one word SMS and that would be it. I always felt something towards her, but never knew what it was.

How should i explain that i love her? How do i express myself? I feel like i missed alot of green flags and that it shows, but I want to correct myself and would like to suppprt her and appreciate her. 

Any help will be thanked.

Today is my 21st birthday, and i have spent the day doing things i enjoy. I went and watched the new spider man movie with my sister and brother in law, went to eat with a few of their friends, and am about to go home. By all means i should be having a good day, but all i can be is really sad. 

I dont have any real friends. I play alot of video games in my free time, and have connectef with alot of people on line. But i havent had that same luck in my day to day life. I used to date this girl, was actually dated her for 5 years, and was engaged to her the last year of the relationship. We broke up a couple of years ago now, after i dropped out of college to try and salvage our relationship, and everything has kinda fallen apart from there. 

Alot of my friends were her friends first, and stopped talking to me when we broke up. The remainder of my friends in my old hometown had already moved off and went to other colleges or cities, and i diddnt really have a way to connect with new people, because i dont have a way to learn how to drive. My only close family is too busy with their lives to take the time to teach me, and even when they do they just get frustrated with me. 

I dont drink, i dont smoke, and since i havent been going to church recently, alot of the people i was close to when i was here before i went to college seem to be able to care less about me. I dont know what to do, i dont wanna go to bars to connect with people because due to personal convictions i dont like drinking. Where should i go to connect with people and make friends? Im just kind of at a loss for what to do. But spending my 21st birthday with no friends has been a sad wake up call to the state of my life.

905,c9zhkm,anon9874123,"I (27M) asked a girl (25F) out, she said she couldn't decide due to personal issues, now she doesn't seem to want to talk to me anymore. Not sure how to interpret this.","Some background: Recently I've gotten to know a girl who I really like. This is new to me, even though I'm 27 this is the first time I'm actually seriously attracted to someone. We are both PhD students who work at the same department, but on different subjects and under a different professor, so we see each other quite often but we don't actually have to work together. So I figured that it wouldn't be a problem to start a relationship. Besides, there are a few other couples like this already, nobody seems to have a problem with this.

Anyway, we got along quite well, so eventually I decided to just tell her I liked her and would like to get to know her better, and asked her if she felt the same way. She replied that she couldn't decide at that time, because she was dealing with personal issues that she wanted to deal with first. She didn't say exactly what kind of issues, but she did say that this was also the reason why she sometimes didn't show up for work (publicly she would claim that she was simply working from home, which is allowed here). I didn't ask for more details (I don't know her \*that\* well), I just said no problem, I understand, just let me know if you make up your mind.

The next day she didn't show up to work. The day after that she did show up, but from that point on I started to get the impression that she didn't want to talk to me anymore. She was friendly, but she seemed rather uncomfortable and wouldn't say very much. However since we are usually not alone I couldn't just ask her what was wrong. I thought she probably just wanted some space, so I started talking to her less and less, but that didn't seem to help. When I eventually did get a chance to talk to her alone, she said she didn't have time and was just about to leave - but then ended up staying for another 15 minutes. The next day she again didn't show up to work. At this point I stopped trying to talk to her, because it seemed like I was just making her feel worse and I really didn't know what else I could do.

It's been about a month now since I initially asked her out. She still hasn't said much, and I'm not sure what to think. She sometimes leaves at weird times or disappears for an hour in the middle of the day, so I suspect that she's still struggling with something, but at the same time she seems perfectly happy when she's talking to anyone other than me.

Should I just assume that she's not interested, but too afraid to say so? Or should I assume that she's still dealing with her own problems and keep waiting? Should I try to talk to her, or just leave her alone? I wouldn't mind that much if she had just told me that she wasn't interested, but now I feel like I've done something wrong and have lost a friend as a result.

907,c9zgyt,flowerfood,How do I [21F] leave my abusive boyfriend [21M] of 4 years?,"I’m honestly so shaken up. We’ve been dating for almost five years and we’ve had an endless amount of ups and downs, a lot of them I’ve credited them to growing up together and being in a relationship for so long. However, recently I’ve had enough. He yells at me so much, and it’s been going on for a while now because he has anger issues but for the past year it’s been so bad. For example, when we are arguing and he’s driving he tells me he will kill us both. I tell him not to touch me (he tends to grab my face when arguing) and he asks me what am I going to do about it, telling me he can beat me to death because I’m just a little girl. Honestly I’m not crazy about life but what completely crushes me is the impact that my death would have on my family. Thankfully I’ve been blessed with a loving family and I have a little 7 year old sister that I know would be heartbroken if anything were to happen to me, I know my parents would be completely devastated as well. They don’t know how abusive he is though, I hide it and to them he’s the best guy ever because that’s what I paint him as. But whenever I’m in those dangerous situations i just think of them and how I have to do whatever it takes to get out of the situation without a bruise and alive. After my boyfriends outbursts he ends up crying and apologizing, I recognize it’s his huge anger issues (which bleed everywhere, not just with me) getting the best of him but I can’t handle it anymore. He seems genuinely remorseful, it’s like some angry demon thing over takes him and then leaves but I can’t deal with this any longer. It’s been getting in the way of school as well, I’m in college and sometimes when we’d argue he’d come up between classes and tell me to get in the car or else he’d do x, y &amp;amp; z. It’s always over some small thing too. The last major one was when I walked away from him at the mall because I wanted to cool off from a petty argument we were having and he grabbed me by the arm and forced me out of there into the car to yell at me and call me names for walking away from him and then proceeded to drive angrily and say all of the things I mentioned previously. I wish I could sometimes just lay down and erase these things from my head. I wish I never met this side of the world. He’s never hit me with a closed fist but has left bruises on my body from throwing me around the room or grabbing me forcefully. 

Now here is my problem...whenever I mention leaving he says he will kill himself, that he will send explicit photos to my family members, come to my house and families (he knows where they live as well). I don’t know what to do. I don’t want him to hurt himself, I don’t want photos being sent to my family. Since we’ve been dating for so long he has a good portion of phone numbers. He says he will do all of that and doesn’t matter if I call the cops because he has nothing to lose which in a sense he’s right, he has no family members near and just goes to work everyday. His parents aren’t that close to him, he doesn’t live with either of them and one of them is out of state, but I’m still afraid that if I were to contact them that he would immediately go to contacting my own family. If we are speaking in person and I try telling him we need to break up he just asks me “Are you sure about that” whenever I’m leaving the room/car to go our separate ways and it scares me into staying. He’s joked about how he will kill me if I ever leave him or go with another man (which then he adds he will kill us both). He’s burned himself in front of me before, punched himself, cut himself, etc so I feel like he’s capable of harming himself to a deeper extent. I’m scared that if I call the cops when he says he’s going to do it he will just leave angry and text my family or something. :( How can I leave him? Someone please help me. I know I should reach out to family but I’m scared and want to handle this as quietly as possible. What I’m thinking of is one day going on his phone and deleting all of the photos of me but I’m scared this will set him off. I don’t know what to do, right now things are ok, its just when he’s angry that it’s an issue. Any advice or stories of people coming out of similar situations would be extremely soothing...I know Im lucky that he doesn’t full on beat me but Im still super nervous on what to do. Thank u to anyone who took the time to read this..

Edit: I also have a video recording that I secretly took from the last incident and you can hear him say some threatening things in it. If I were to go to the police with this, does anyone know what would happen/have an idea?

I’m his first love and “real” relationship as you’d say. He’s very loyal and I could never see him hurting me in anyway. I just don’t want him to think I’m tired of him because that’s not the case I don’t want him to get too much of me even though he says that’s not possible. But with how our relationship is it never gets tiring or too much. He’s my best friend my other half. I can tell him anything and everything. I know everything about him and vice versa. We talk about things normal people would be scared to say to there partner. No filter. No lies. All honesty and great talks. Never gets boring and always feels new. I fall in love all over every day. Everything always feels exciting. He makes me feel things I have never felt in my life with anyone. I thought I loved my last ex which I did but not even close to how I love my current. I can do anything in front of him without any embarrassment or judgement. Just looking at him I get butterflies and makes me the happiest girl in the world. Just thinking about him gets me tingling in places I’ve never tingled. I know I could never get tired or enough of him. I know I will always love him and that he’s the one. I’m just scared his feelings will change even though he’s assured me in every way possible that they won’t. I honestly don’t even think I should feel this way but for some reason I’m really scared.. maybe it’s because I’m really in love this time? And giving it my all?

Title basically gives my explanation of events. And I’m sorry if this doesn’t sound coherent, I’m crying for the first time since I was 10 (I don’t really show emotions and it shocked me when I start crying) while writing this.

My sophomore year of college was very busy. I had classes and a full time job during the whole school year. I got good grades and made some decent money from my job. I failed to get an internship but luckily I did some freelance stuff so I can still put it on me resume.

With the money I saved from working, I decided that I would just relax this summer. I previously worked at a fast food places (name rhymes with Mendy’s) and absolutely hated it. After every shift I would just be physically drained. So because I had money in my bank account, I decided that I would relax for the three months I have of summer break. I know once I got back to school in early August, I’m not gonna have the free time like I do this summer.

So most days I would be in my room watching YouTube, watching sports or playing video games. I wouldn’t say that I’m an introvert, but all my friends work full time jobs as well so my options were limited. I always felt bad when my parents would ask if I wanted to see a movie they were going to see and I would say no. We just don’t like the same things.

I honestly was having a great summer in my mind. I would hang out with my friends when I could, and if not, I was totally fine being by myself. My parents are borderline gambling addicts so I was always fine with being alone when they went to the casino. My parents make good money from their jobs so I don’t blame them if they wanna have fun at the casino. 

Sorry for the rambling but I need to get to the events of the past day. Yesterday was my birthday (21st yippee) and I went out with my friends that night. The next day, my mother and I went to the RMV to renew my license. Well long story short, I fucked up and didn’t renew it correctly. My mother pointed it out after I said how much I paid and when I didn’t do the standard eye test. My license in fact doesn’t expire till next year but if I have an internship next summer, I don’t wanna be in my home state preferably.

So when she finds out that I fuck up, she starts berating me. Mind you that my mother has been my rock for my entire life. She won’t admit it but I know she has anger management problems. When she starts raising her voice, I just “late the hate flow through me” and screams at her to “fuck off.” I know in hindsight it was wrong to do, but in my family if someone starts yelling, you have to yell back to get your point across.

Then. Shit. Hits. The. Fan.

We basically have a screaming match and I call my father knowing that she’d only stop if I call him. I explain everything that happened at the DMV and I don’t know why, but I just started crying. 

Anytime my mother sees someone cry she yells “why are you crying!?” Like she doesn’t understand that people sometimes cry when they get yelled at. I’ve been good at not crying but I just couldn’t keep it in this time. 

I cry the whole way home as she keeps berating me for what I did. She mentions all the things she does for me and “this how I repay her back for all the things she does for me.” When I got home, my dad asks me if I need to go to therapy.

I legit was shocked that he even asked me that. I’ve never dealt with mental problems in my life. I ask him why and he says because I’ve been cooped up in my room all summer. I tell him that I had a busy school year and that I just wanted to relax. Mind you that for the first month and a few weeks, I was still doing the occasional freelance stuff. But he thinks there’s something wrong with me just because I enjoy playing video games in my free time.

I actually did start working again this week just to get a little extra cash in my pocket before I headed back to college. But he doesn’t get why I wasn’t working the whole time. My dad goes on to say that my mother has always been the only one in my corner. I seriously think he hates me. And I’m okay with that because a lot of time, I hate him too. But now after the shouting match today, I have no one. 

I seriously believe my parents think I have mental problems or suicidal thoughts. But I can tell you that I do not. I love life, I love my major in college, I love the future career that I’m going to have. I’m optimistic for the future. I have nothing to fear right now.

The only question I have is...what do I do? Do I work more to please my dad and sacrifice my enjoyment the rest of this summer? I really have no need for therapy because I seriously feel like nothing is wrong. I have four weeks till I fly back down for college and I really CAN’T WAIT. I miss my job down there and I love going to class. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciate because I’m seriously at a loss of words.",2019-07-05 17:06:18,21,216,relationship_advice

913,c9zd96,VisualLimit,Anyone experience 'breaks' in relationships?,"Please no discouraging comments, only looking for advice since this is my first time experiencing this and would be nice to hear your stories.

Edit: Apparently I wasn't clear enough - I ONLY want to hear your stories about your experiences.  Please do not simply tell me to break it off since none of you know exactly what happened. I'm not asking whether to break it off or not, I'm just looking for your experiences, that's all.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend of 3 years and I recently have been arguing a lot so we mutually decided to take a break and 'start over' by being friends. This all started because 2-3 months ago we started a new chapter in life, not sure what else to call it, something we've never been through. We are both in college and recently both of us started working 9-5 jobs, Mon-Fri and not living with each other. This hit our relationship very negatively since we barely saw each other and even though we were always texting each other it felt like we didn't really know what was going on in each of our lives. This also brought up a lot of past arguments we had, which made it worse. There were always little things like how I wished he would plan dates instead of me, but they weren't huge dealbreakers and we always worked through them. My emotions have been all over the place so I don't know how to think straight right now. At first I was like 'oh I miss him', but now I almost feel relieved to be taking a break to get a chance to step back and look at things. I will admit I am an awful person when I'm mad - like extremely toxic, I'll say hurtful things and I'm working on it. We basically agreed that if either of us wanted to see other people, that would be fine. We are still talking like we did when we were friends, before we started dating.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm honestly not sure where I'm going with this. I'm not leaning toward either side of 'getting back together' or 'breaking up'. I'm a little confused and lost in the middle of both.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit #2: Just some background for those providing advice, my boyfriend is very introverted, kind and trusts me. (and vice versa) He has never yelled at me or got mad at me, it's pretty much always me that gets picky with little things. And since we both agreed that it would be alright to see other people if we choose to, he and I would never call each other out for 'cheating' since we both agreed to it. We are both very good at talking out problems and we were pretty much best friends before starting to date so we will remain friends and continue to talk regardless.",2019-07-06 22:09:38,5,1,relationship_advice
914,c9zczm,drearaemomo,Am I being petty?,"My [M37] boyfriend has a wedding band tattoo in the form of his ex-wife’s initials. They have been divorced for 6 years and have two children together. He is communicating his intentions of wanting a long term relationship and marriage with me [F31]. Since we started dating I have tried to communicate in different ways how much his tattoo bothers me. I even told him i don’t want to introduce him to my family bcz of it. He says he’d change it to my initials and at first I was like ok whatever it takes to just not see her initials and everything they stand for on his ring finger every day. After a couple months and speaking with some close friends, I decided I don’t think it’s the best idea to just convert the initials of the tattoo to mine. (The letters are able to be changed from her three initials to my three without looking too modified). I’ve communicated how saddening it is to me to see it when we are together, how it makes me feel he is still representing her as his woman to the world, how it steals my happiness when we’re having a good time then I catch a glance at the tattoo then it ruins the moment for me. He always disregards it and just says “it doesn’t mean anything to me”. I repeatedly express to him that it’s more than just how HE feels about it now that he is pursuing a serious relationship with me, yet friends &amp; family ask me why I’m with him while he still has the tattoo of his ex of 6 years in his ring finger still. I told him it makes me feel like an idiot when we’re out and people see it on him, knowing they’re not my initials, but then see us together in a serious relationship. I don’t know what else to do or say, it’s affecting the way I feel about the relationship and how much he actually cares about me. He says he won’t have the tattoo there when he eventually proposes to me. So I’m supposed to just suck up my feelings about this all the way until HE’S ready? Even after I told him how it’s affecting me...Should I be letting something like this affect my emotions and relationship with him so extremely? 😫",2019-07-06 22:08:58,9,1,relationship_advice
915,c9zayp,aldrichisagal24,"I (14M) don’t know if my crush (14F) likes me, Help?","Okay you may have already lost interest but stick around for a bit, please? I dunno if this is the right place, but I’ll do it anyway. It’s a very long and complicated story, you’ll see why. 


So a little backstory? I’m 14, a guy, and have had a crush on this girl for a bit now. I’d say about 2 years? She’s also 14, and we’re friends, in the same classes, well, mostly.  Me and her, we’ve uh, done stuff, you probably wouldn’t expect normal “friends to do” I won’t go into full detail but I’ll explain later.

About a year ago, me and this girl became proper friends. Like, we already knew each other, but this is around the time we really did “friend” stuff, and I’d probably consider her my best friend at the time. I can’t remember how it started, but we just started texting and going round each others houses and that. 

So good start right? We were seeing each other decently, about twice a fortnight, what, with school as well? But here’s the thing. I was hiding my crush from her. We were best friends, but I secretly had feelings for her.

Anyway, as we start seeing each other more, we grow a lot closer. Sometimes we’d cuddle on her couch and watch a film, or cuddle IN bed, just lying there. And, I’m not gonna go into much detail, but she started “playing” with me. And no, it wasn’t sex, let’s just get that cleared up. What I mean is, rubbing her hand against my belly, stuff like that.

Okay, this is gonna sound really fake, 1. Because of our age and 2. It just sounds made up, but believe me. She had me uh, do SOMETHING to HER something, with my HAND. I hope you’re getting what I mean, but don’t worry, it was over her trousers.

At this point you may be thinking, “of course she likes you!” Ehhh I’m not so sure. Here’s why:

You can probably imagine at my age I was pumped. Id got into a bed with my crush! I was over the moon! But then, it just kinda stopped. She was no longer REALLY close to me, she didn’t seem herself. I didn’t wanna force her to being close to me, I was just curious why, had I done something wrong? 

We started to argue, and if you remember, I was still hiding my crush from her. At this point, I was so guilty of hiding it, and I just had to tell her. She didn’t really know how to react, she was just silent. And then all contact just stopped. For about 4-5 months. We saw each other in school and stuff, but just never talked or even acknowledged each other. 

It was sad, losing her. Partially because I was so close to going the next step, but also because she was just a great friend, I missed her.

I have other guy friends though, and before I confessed to her, she was part of our group, she was the only girl in it. But AFTER I confessed, she moved away from them too, now she’s got a new group. She didn’t completely cut all contact with us, she still often talks to us at lunchtimes and stuff, but most of the time she’s with her new friends. 


And by the way....most of her new group are guys. Same age as us. And there’s one guy in the group I think she’s like “best friends”  with. I dunno if he’s crushing on her, I dunno if she’s crushing on him...

But good news. Recently I started talking to her again. In school, and via text.  She definitely likes me, I’m just not sure HOW much. And we’ve had some strange/positive encounters.

For example, me and my friend were having banter and I kept on calling him hot, and she kept on replying with “I’m hot”.
Another example, we were having a deep conversation face to face about what animals we would be if we could. Lol don’t worry it was just because I kept on saying I would be a cock, or a cockerel. Oh and she was replying with “you’re a cock”, in a friendly way.


Help! Does she like me? 

What tips can you guys give me to get closer/ see if she likes me?

And pls pls pls if you have very good tips PM me, I need all this info lol.

918,c9z9he,tiacalypso,My friend‘s boyfriend apparently molested another friend. WDID?,"So, I‘m going to try and make this brief, without real names.

Since between 2005 and 2010, I was very close with a group of 5 girls in high school. One of them is Anne. In 2008ish I also made friends with Liz, via a bunch of other high school friends. Anne, Liz, and I are all part of a wider friend group from that school who still hangs out to this day. In 2014ish Anne started dating a guy whom we knew from school but weren‘t close with. Let‘s call him Luke. I have never seen Anne as happy as she has been with Luke. Luke and I never had much in common so I wouldn‘t say we are or were close. But we get on. Liz was mostly close to me and two other girls from the group, Katie and Mel. Eventually, she stopped coming to hang outs. I was surprised but accepted it. In 2019, Liz phoned me and told me about how one night in 2010, after high school graduation, she and Luke went to someone‘s party as friends. FYI: in our country, high school is 13 years and you start age 6-7. So we were all 19-20, legal age of consent to sex with another adult is 16, legal age to drink beer is 16, legal age to drink spirits is 18. So at the party they drunk, as they had done before. When Luke walked her home, Liz passed out on a bench and woke up to him molesting her. He had his hands down her bra groping her breasts. I had no idea of this before 2019 and I was horrified. Anyway, Anne dating Luke is difficult for Liz. Anne is a lawyer so I‘m sure she doesn‘t know about this incident. But Liz doesn‘t want to be around Luke. But Katie, Mel, and I are closer to Anne and spend more time with her and often Luke. We don‘t know how to handle the situation at all. 

I don‘t want to be the one to tell Anne but I feel like I should, as her friend. Luke clearly knows and remembers what he did to Liz as after the incident je stopped speaking to her and is clearly embarrassed (according to Liz). She thinks he‘s ashamed. 

My current path is to behave normally until Liz decides how to handle the situation. She can‘t make up her mind about how to confront him or even IF to confront him. I‘ve tried bringing to mind my concern and consideration for Anne who is also my friend and is faultless here. But Liz plainly doesn‘t care for Anne or Anne‘s welfare in this. Which to a degree I understand, but she can‘t expect that of me.

919,c9z7y6,IMustSayThat,Can I ask my (28F) SO (30M) to not text or call me during his holidays?,"Boyfriend of 2 years went on holidays with co-workers. Since they had a 3 day business trip on the other side of the world, they decided to turn it into a 16-day holiday to make flying so far worth it. I couldn't join them for financial reasons, and never complained about him going. 

I also never had any problems with him going on holidays by himself, that's only fair considering he makes much more money than I do, but he usually goes with male friends. His co-workers though are all women (there's just one other guy), mostly single, and I don't know any of them. 

I'm not in a good place mentally right now. I've been having money problems, health problems, a lot of pressure on grad school and my main group of friends doesn't live in the same town as I do right now. Him texting me during his holidays to say what he's doing, sending pictures of him surrounded by a bunch of women, or posting insta stories of them partying has been doing more harm than good to how I'm feeling. I want to know all about his holidays, but when he's back, not right now. So I would like to cut down our communication to a minimum for this two weeks to try and destress a little without having to worry about what he's doing. However I don't think that's fair on him - not talking for two weeks might be a mood killer during his holidays. 

Should I ask him not to text/send pictures or whatever just for the sake of me feeling better?

TLDL - SO went on holidays with a bunch of female co workers and I don't want pictures/videos/messages to inform me of what they are doing. Can I ask him to quit texting or am I being selfish?",2019-07-06 21:55:55,13,1,relationship_advice
920,c9v44v,paramedicbunchy,Is my girlfriend cheating on me?,"My girlfriend (23F) and I (25M) have been together for 3 years. I love her. She loves me. I know that and I am confident in the fact that I know we are in love with each other. Fortunately we have a pretty decent relationship. We live together in our own house, we have two cats together, we have talked in depth about marriage and children, we have an established life together. But I have my concerns. She’s always on her phone. Always snap chatting other guys that she’s friends with from work and when questioned she just simply says they’re just work friends. In March she got a new iPhone. The next day she was at work and the dresser drawer wouldn’t stop vibrating. I opened it up and found her old phone, on 1%, that she never logged out of iCloud on. There’s messages from another guy, so I look at them, what boyfriend wouldn’t? So here’s the screenshots of the messages, you tell me what you think..(https://imgur.com/gallery/hcH3qyi)

And this is the guys response when I just sent him a calm, articulate, adult message just asking if this was all true: (https://imgur.com/gallery/6Eyttz1)

Her and I of course had an in depth conversation/argument. We were pretty close to breaking up. 

She maintains that she did not kiss him, did not dance with him. She denies adamantly being drunk. We moved on from it though. I forgave her. I really did forgive her for it. But that doesn’t mean I just forget about it.

So a month ago I see she’s snap chatting this kid named Dan from her work (she’s an EMT), and I question her about it, and her usual response to me questioning things like that is her acting frustrated that I don’t trust her lol. She then offered to delete him without me even asking and I said “okay yeah” and so she did delete him. Still sketchy though.... then yesterday, I see snapchats (videos and pictures) that have been going back and forth for about 2 weeks, meaning she went behind my back again and added him back on Snapchat to talk to him again.

My advice I’m looking for, is in your opinion, based on her past actions, do you think she is cheating on me? How should I go about getting more proof, or confronting her about it? Whatever advice you can give would be much appreciated. I hate going to work (I’m a firefighter so I work 24 hour shifts) and being away from her without knowing what she could possibly be doing.

924,c9wjkf,WaxMasterFresh710,Really need advice.,"So my girlfriend and I have been dating for two years now and throughout this time she has been selling nudes.  Not a lot or frequently but at least a few times a month.  Now this was a non issue for us because i was okay with it.. until i wasnt. Now its not like this feeling comes out of no where and ill explain...

So she was sexually abused as a child and over the last year or so that has all rapidly rose to the surface and naturally, we stopped having sex of any kind. I want to give her her space to heal. And thats fine. But now i cant ever feel confident with our relationship, and im always terrified that shes gonna cheat on me even though i see the fear in her eyes when we have tried to start becoming intimate. And i know that feeling is irrational but, non the less its there.

Now her selling nudes WAS fine but i wanna die inside when she tells me she sent nudes to some guy.  And this morning I told her i didn't want her to sell anyone anything until we get us figured out.
She blew up. Mad im ""having a problem with this now"" and ""its a good source of extra income"" but, id rather be happy then have a few extra bucks. We haven't had sex in a year as of the 22nd of July and i just cant seem to breathe when she isnt intimate with me but is willing to for some random guy with $50

Ive given her space and time. She wont seek therapy for it. Its been a constant fight for a year solid. Idk. Am i being unreasonable for telling her i want to work on us before she can sell nudes again or am i just ungrateful for what i have?

I met a girl on a dating app who originally just wanted to chat with people, but after some time she asked me if we wanted to meet and I was very happy and said yes. We met and got along really well. I mean really really well. She usually only meets with people for like 3 hours but we spent about 9 hours together. Now the problems: I didn't think I would like her that much and when she said that she was meeting some other guy the next day for a date I was a bit upset. I started to think if this is a date or just hanging out as friends. Well today I asked her if her intentions are to date or just be friends. She said just friends and I was again a bit hurt. The problem is I don't exactly know why. I think it has something to do with my depression/self esteem. I ask myself why she is interested in dates with over people and not me? And I know thats stupid but I just feel it and its kinda hard to change your feelings. I kinda want to be friends with her because I lost most of my friends due to my depression and I really liked her but I'm having a problem when she's talking and alluding to other guys.

Haven't been on a Tinder date for years. I [33F] mean it. Matched with this very cute guy [32M]so we had a very ad hoc tinder date arranged before his business trip out town.

We spent 2 hours drinking at a bar after work and had an enjoyable chat. There was a DJ that night so we started dancing and it was all good, except perhaps we were a bit drunk, there was a bit of touching between us.

We called it off soon after since we both had to work the next day. He said we will meet again next week. 

He messaged the next day with a just one line telling me when will he be back from his business trip ""in case you want to know :)"" and messaged me when he landed. He asked me out after landing (home) and after some inner-debate he decided not to meet since it was very late.

Any one can tell me if he is interested since there is no more messages from him. I know its only a day after he landed but I think I quite like him and have a crush on him. I don't want to be the one who's initiating if he isn't interested. Should I be a bit more patient? I know he is a busy guy at work.  Advice are appreciated.  x",2019-07-06 14:10:21,9,4,relationship_advice
930,c9z1wx,ghostapollo,Trouble with mentally ill ex,"There will be a TLDR at end. Also I’m on mobile so sorry for bad format. Also I have dyslexia sorry for spelling errors.  

The cast- Me: teen in high school I’m a female. Ex: teen same class a male. D: a female friend M: my really close friend. 
Ok let’s get started 

So I liked this boy about a year ago. We started to go out shortly after school started. It was amazing the honey moon faze. I started to get in arguments with D and Ex was causing a lot of problems with her. They did not get along. 

Soon enough me and the friend broke ties in a messy way. I started hanging out with Ex more at his house and we’d have heavy make out seasons. They soon led to more things that I was not ready for. It progressed and Ex guilted me into many things. 

My class took a road trip and I got to sit next to him on the bus. I was so excited. He has bad allergies and on the trip they where very bad.  He wouldn’t talk to me or anything just sat there refusing to take his meds for his allergies. He snapped at me right before this trip and told me I was too depressing. I am having a hard time with money and I would talk to him about it. He snapped at me and told me that I was too depressing and I couldn’t talk to him about anything but happy things. 

Soon things went down hill more and it was him telling me that our friends where doing terrible things.  
He started being crazy and never texting me. I stopped talking to him stopped going out and one the first day of summer I dumped him. 

Now we’ve reached today. 

I’m starting to date a new guy an old friend that I’ve know for 3 years. Ex dmed me out of the blue right after me and the new boy went public. Ex wants to be friends I’d say I needed time and would talk to him about it later. 

Ex texts me today after I’ve been out with C the new boy.  He apologizes for being shitty. He’s been way more then shitty. He was abusive. Now I don’t know how to respond to him. He’s on meds and I’ve moved on but I feel like I’m going to break at some point and it’ll be soon.

TLDR: abusive ex dms me to apologize and wants to be friends and smile about it all.",2019-07-06 21:40:15,0,1,relationship_advice
931,c9wgq1,kyleray96,Broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years.,"Me (23 m) and my (ex)girlfriend (21 f), just broke up after 3 years a couple days ago. She has been struggling with depression for the last 6 months or so. At first it was fine, I was there for her, she vented to me. She’d let me know what was going on, and I’d comfort her.

About 3 months ago, I bought a house, she moved in with me, and that’s when things really went down hill. She stopped talking to me about her emotions, instead she looked to other guys for comfort, I don’t think she cheated on me, but I was never the one she wanted for emotional support. I’d try to talk to her about what was going on, she’d always say something like “I don’t wanna talk about it let’s just go to bed” and she’s get mad if I tried to dig deeper.

The other night she finally was willing to sit down and talk, she said that the reason she’s been distancing herself from me is because she has no self love. She feels like she has to rely on me for everything. (She doesn’t make much money, I pay for the house, all bills, and groceries). After a long talk we decide that it’s best we break up. She says she needs time to just do her own thing. And focus on loving herself, I agree. I help her pack her stuff, and move her back to her parents.

Last night, she wanted to come over and talk, she says she wants to take everything back. And get back together. But I don’t want too. Honestly, being single for a while is what I want. It’d be nice just to focus on myself for a while. I’ve always been in a serious relationship since I was 16. (Dated a girl from 16-20y was single for a couple months, then dated her). I told her I’m not cutting her out of my life completely, and I’ll still be there if she needs anything. She took it pretty hard. 

I don’t know what to do. I do care about her. But I’m just not ready to completely settle down right now. Am I just being an asshole? I could see myself being with her again in the future, maybe even marrying her. But right now I feel like I just need to do my own thing, and do what makes me happy. What do you think I should do?",2019-07-06 17:53:47,3,2,relationship_advice
932,c9z193,noturgfipromise,I’m vaguely threatened by partners old friend becoming regular part of our social circle,"Sorry for formatting, on mobile and my first post ever. (Throwaway account) I’m gonna leave out a few details that could make it obvious should my partner find this post. 

My (F) partner and I have been together for 1.5-2ish years, but have a couple years of casual flirting/hooking up before that. He was unfaithful in the first year of our relationship, though never physically (or so he says, but I don’t entirely believe him). He’s older by a few years, smarter than me, has fairly different interests/hobbies to my own. 

Recently he introduced me to a friend of his from his early adult life, who I’d only ever heard of via stories from 7-8 years ago (before I had met my partner). I don’t think they were ever romantically or sexually involved, but he was promiscuous in his late teens/early 20s. 
His old friend (F) is beautiful and they eat along really well despite a few years of little to no contact, which is an immediate red flag to me as he’d been unfaithful to me in the past and I’m still hurt from it. They’re the same age, have similar life experiences, common interests, a shared social circle from their younger days and they converse so easily, all of which make me a little jealous because I often feel Im too young or too uninformed about his hobbies to get involved with his interests. 
He and I live together, and he’s only seen her three times (as far as I know) since reconnecting and I’ve been there all three times and haven’t noticed any warning signs in their physical interactions (she hugged him when leaving each time but not me. I figure it’s just because she does t know me very well). They text often though, and I haven’t read their messages incase I find something I don’t want to see. 

I’m genuinely scared that he’s going to develop an interest in her (or rekindle an old one that I don’t know about) and either leave me or cheat on me physically. 

TLDR baes old friend in the picture, she seems like a more compatible partner than me, I’m fucking terrified",2019-07-06 21:38:36,3,1,relationship_advice
933,c9uvsw,meech98,Am I immature or is she controlling? Together almost 3 years. [M21 &amp; F22],"My girlfriend is the love of my life, but it makes me sick how she acts when I want to go out on my own and hangout with my friends. She always says how insecure she is and how uncomfortable it makes her that I want to go out on my own. I try my best to help her get over her insecurities and reassure her that she has nothing to worry about. sometimes I cannot help hit to say forget it and disregard how she feels and do what I want. Even when it comes down to texting she demands that  I text her 24/7.  For example, if I go out to the bar with my friends she demands that  we  stay in constant contact, even while she is asleep..... meaning she forces me to text her my every move once she falls asleep and if she wakes up and I haven’t texted her then it will for sure be a bad day. 

 (A little history): She was in a physically and mentally abusive relationship before ours and this is my first serious girlfriend.  And as of right now she is seriously struggling with her weight, but she thinks it bothers me. The only thing that is bothering me is her lack of confidence. I have never betrayed her in anyway but with her acting like this towards me the thoughts are creeping in.

Is she using me as a crutch?

935,c9wd3e,ratinbandana,Feelings for Best Friend/Ex,"Long story short I [F 18] dated my best friend’s ex [M 18] this year, we were friends but not that close when we got together. My friend said she was fine with it (she had broken up with him) but later wasn’t. During our relationship I felt anxious and inadequate since I had unfairly compared myself to my friend throughout most of the relationship. 
My ex never put pressure on me or anything- it was all in my head and I regret spending most of our relationship worrying about it’s unavoidable demise. We were both not in the right place mentally to get into a relationship and agreed to end things mutually. It also turns out he still had feelings for my friend which hurt to hear. We talked about our relationship extensively shortly after we broke up and I really was over him. 
We’ve been broken up for about 4 months now and have become extremely close- maybe even best friends. We’ve spent more time together post-breakup than we did when we were together and have grown a lot since then. We do things together all the time and many people think we’re a couple. I’ve given him the healthy connection he needs and he’s told me I changed his life for the better. We pretty much act like a couple except for the intimacy. He’s become a much happier and secure person, and I’ve become more sure of myself as well. Im away for most of the summer and keep catching myself thinking of him and not seeing him hurts more than I anticipated. He calls me at least once a week and we text every day. There’s definitely a chance he feels the same way but we’re going to different colleges in the same state. Once again the timing is off and i don’t know what to do. Plus we’re young and have our whole lives ahead of us. I just wish we had gotten together later in our lives because we really do have a great connection. 

In summary: I’ve fallen for the person my ex has become but don’t know if I should communicate that to him.",2019-07-06 17:45:25,0,2,relationship_advice

I'm the opposite, I'm not super fond of 3d wave feminism and would not call myself a feminist or a liberal. that does not mean I hate feminism.

939,c9wawn,m1h1mc,How do I (22F ) help my suicidal bf (25M). We don't have access to therapy . I don't know how to make him get over feeling like a loser .,"Throwaway account. And sorry English isn't my first language.

A few years ago my boyfriend dropped out of school and struggled alot working small jobs , and little by little he  built a little business from scratch , and was doing very well and made alot of money. He worked out regularly, got himself an amazing muscular body , ate healthy . He had an amazing drive and willpower and was in a good place in life.
 
It's been 3 years now that his business encountered a lot of problems, he stopped making any money . He couldn't save the business. 

Since then he has lost all motivation to do anything . He doesn't workout any more even though he loved it . He lost any will to work because he doesn't have the energy nor the opportunities to build a business again, and absolutely hates the Idea of working small jobs. He says he would rather die.

Actually he speaks more and more seriously about suicide and it worries the hell out of me.

In our country therapy costs a fortune, and there are very few therapists around. And they are incompetent. So that's impossible . 

He wants to leave the country and is currently looking for an opportunity to do that . I would love to join him too if he leaves.

Of course I always tell him that he is great, that I believe in him and will love him no matter what . But it's not enough.

What could make him believe in himself again? 
I think that he needs to prove to himself that he can achieve something so that he doesn't feel like a loser anymore . But I don't know how to make that happen exactly . 

 How can he help him? What should we do?  Any help is appreciated.

941,c9q73i,SalsaPopsicle,Heart broken by somebody I wasn’t even in a relationship with.,"This post is more or less just to vent. While this sort of situation isn’t unique, I’ve seen the sort of kindness strangers have lent to others, as well as swift smacks in the face to bring some back to reality. I could use a little of both. The weight is heavy and I have a little bit of unloading to do. I also apologize for the novel. 


To preface this story, I want to admit that I’m the sort of serial, couple-dates-and-done sort of guy. I love the chase, I love getting to know new people even if it’s just for a moment. Some may call it playing, but if your intentions are transparent with a mutual understanding from the beginning I see nothing wrong in casually dating. Especially saying if feelings are mutual and won’t be hurt. Anyways, I’ve been doing things this way for several years. 

Lately I had been feeling this twinge of “what the hell are you doing?”. Which could be existential? A biological alarm clock that’s starting to wake me up to the potential of finding the right person? Very rarely do I meet a person who I can settle in with immediately. I’m a 27 year old guy. My sense of humor is a bit irreverent. My politics are moderate. My musical taste is that of a late nineties John Cusack from the movie “Hi Fidelity”, mixed with a 16 year old girl. I’m a touring musician with a slight alcohol abuse problem. So needless to say, I’m entirely aware none of these things help my case in finding “the one”. This laundry list paired with the illusion of perfection and “the next best thing” dating apps have created, it’s more than likely I’m just as much of a “one and done” type of situation to most women as well. This has never hurt my feelings. 

Moving on. 

About 4 months ago, I’m doing my regular scrolling through X dating app. Absentmindedly receive a message from this woman I can’t even recall seeing previously. She is an absolute knockout. Out of my league if I’m giving myself any credit. (I’d say I’m a 7.5/10 on a good day) I’m bad at texting or online messaging, but we hit it off immediately. It’s as if we had known each other in some way or another and were just catching up. Her eyes were familiar. It sounds so woo woo and cliche to talk about “just knowing”, but it was such an overwhelmingly eerie feeling. At this point, I hadn’t given that aspect much thought, just feeling ego boosted and ready to mingle. We talk infrequently for the next couple weeks. Checking in just to say hello. Replying to Instagram stories, flirting each other up. After some playful banter, we decide to meet up. 

She lives about an hour east of my city, and decided she’d drive in for the evening. We planned on hitting a local vinyl record club set night later in the evening, and everything seemed in order. And this will sound incredibly hokey, overly sentimental, overused etc. but the moment we locked eyes for the first time I turned into a 14 year old on his first date. I felt like I had won a million dollars. I had continued to feel the exact same way the many times after this first night...and if it were to ever happen again, I’m convinced nothing would change. Anyway, after the first five minutes of composing myself, things leveled out. The night went on, and it was one of the most fun and comfortable dates I’ve had with a person in years. We talked about our mutual favorite bands nobody has heard of. Shared personal stories about our families and friends. Laughed way too hard at each other’s dumb jokes. Madeout a little too publicly. The connection was unlike any I had had before. I knew she was my best friend. Off handedly later in the evening after dinner she said, “So, don’t let this freak you out or anything. But I told my mom about you. She’s so excited about how excited I am about you.”. If this had literally been anybody else this soon, being the commitment-phobe I’ve always been, I may have called it a night and ran as far away as humanly possible. But for some reason, this albeit strong, but forward statement had me in puddles. Without being blue or revealing too much, she stayed that night. Waking up with her in the morning felt like heaven. We were both smitten. There are very few things in the world that feel as whole as mutually receiving the love you give. It makes me smile to even think of it at the moment. 

We agreed to keep seeing each other. For the next 3 months, we would make the short drive back and forth between my city and hers. We’d make dinners on the weekends. Go on hikes to her favorite waterfalls in the afternoons. Walk around her small town taking in the sun and talking about life. We’d be up all night making love and staying in bed all morning. She’d mention the future, what a family might look like. We’d talk about what marriage might mean for us. She even insisted on meeting my mother who lived half a day away that happened to be in town for a couple days. There wasn’t a single moment I fought the possibility of a real future with her. It should’ve been terrifying, but it wasn’t. The only thing we hadn’t talked about was being together exclusively. I’m one to let things happen naturally and comfortably. 

One day, several weeks after our first meeting, and after I had finally knocked down enough internal walls to get the confidence to ask, we were on the couch making eyes at each other when I brought up wanting her to be my girlfriend. After all of this, thinking it would be met by a resounding yes, she paused. She started to launch into a couple points about how commitment is uncertain, how her therapist had told her that she needed to “be free” in order to be happy. She mentioned that she just wasn’t ready for a relationship, but she’d be really hurt to see me with anybody else. I agreed. For the first time in my 20s I would feel hurt at the prospect of this person leaving too. Especially for another man. Feeling a bit of recoil from the response, I conceded that if it was time she needed, I’d be willing to wait anything out with her. After all, if I’m being honest I was head over heels for her...I still am. 

After this conversation, I headed back home for a weeks worth of work. During the week we texted and called back and forth as usual. Nothing too frequent, but not underwhelming either. She had even set up a double date with my roommates for later in the week. Everything was going well. She’d express how “I’m all she’s ever known”. How full her heart had been since she had met me. Until later in the week, she cancelled plans for the date. She said that she had a work function to attend and it would be tough to find a dog sitter. Which wasn’t a problem, and things continued as normally as they’d been before. Her usual cute messages would start to thin out over the next couple days leading into the weekend. The weekend came, A few videos started rolling in. My friends asking me what was up. Her Instagram stories showed that she was in my city with another man. Better car. Seemingly more wealthy. Better looking. It was almost like she was putting something in my direct line of sight to send a message without having to outwardly break the news. I’m not a jealous type. Coming from a place of casually dating for so long, it’s never been my place to keep tabs on anybody. But damn, this one sent a searing pain through my chest. Our conversations played back in my head about how much it would hurt her to see me with another woman...she had to have remembered right? But we weren’t even together. So how the hell was it my place to feel hurt or betrayed? It was the most conflicting push and pull between feeling horribly selfish, and desperately hurt. 

The next day, I decided to shoot her a message. It went something along the lines of “if it’s space you need, I’m more than willing to give that to you. I just wish it didn’t have to happen like this”. Messaging back she explained that she “needed time to respond in a kind way”. After a bit of back and forth I told her that I felt like it was ultimately hurtful to have purposefully filled my head with talks about a life together. Insisting on meeting my family. Hinted at having more than basic feelings for me, or that there was never anything between us just a few days later. All while knowing where she ultimately stood. I was, and still am torn. 

She responded with this copy pasted text message: 

“I’m sorry that I said things like that. I can completely and totally understand why that would make can you believe that I needed more.  I came from a place of needing validation because I hadn’t gotten it so fucking long. Me saying those things to you however were more than just me wanting validation it made me feel like I could be loved  again but I know that it may have skewed your perspective on what I wanted. I’m in a headspace of constantly changing what I want and need and I am so uncomfortable with the idea of hurting you.  As much as you probably believe that’s a crock of shit right now.”


After reading, re reading, and re re reading this, I’m still completely lost. And truthfully “hurt” isn’t even the correct word I could use to describe. I never responded. I didn’t know how to. It’s been 3 weeks since, and I still occasionally open this back up to read it again. I haven’t heard from her, and I’ve heard she is in a relationship now. I haven’t had the guts or have wanted to put myself through confirming that. I ultimately want what’s best for her. But could I have saved this? There are so many unanswered questions. Did I say or do something wrong? Was my hair in a weird way the last time she saw me? Or is this just how things end sometimes? A brick to the side of the head. A situation you can’t explain away. I wouldn’t want this for anybody, not even for those I hate.  

I feel resentment. But I feel selfish for it. Is this ok? I feel like I knew what would happen and I just chased it right off of a cliff. How can somebody be so certain, to have it all turn completely upside down?

 I’m a total space cadet, I couldn’t tell you what I had for breakfast this morning, but I could recall every last detail of how her hair smelled when she would lean into me. The little freckle in her blue eyes. How her lips would slightly purse when she was focusing. I remember her vintage blue softball shirt, and form fitting black bootcut jeans. The way her turquoise rings perfectly wrapped around her tan slender fingers. Her sigh after laughing too hard at a terrible joke. The Northstar songs we sang along to. Her favorite foods, her future plans, her mother’s middle name. Her presence in my life changed me. And now I’m sitting here alone in my apartment professing my love for a woman who likely hasn’t thought twice about me since, to strangers on the internet. Maybe it’s some sort of a cosmic debt coming due. Or maybe that’s just life. 

Either way, I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this. I can’t afford a therapist and it’s cathartic.",2019-07-06 05:58:21,13,19,relationship_advice

945,c9ys4q,Plymouthrockrollover,My study partner/friend (20F) seems to only want favors from me (26M) recently.,"I met this person about a month ago. We are in a class together this summer and we became friends as we study together for many hours on the weekend and at school. She reminds me of a cousin I have who is about her age so I felt really close to her and I felt that I treated her kind of like a little sister. The last two times we've met, she seems to rarely talk to me during our study group sessions and she seems to be asking a lot of favors of me like borrowing money and giving her rides to places after we study since she doesn't drive . I feel like she sensed that I felt a familial kind of bond with her and is now trying to take advantage of it. I usually cut people off from my life who I feel are behaving in a way that doesn't agree with what I want from the people in my life but I've recently been trying to learn how to communicate more in my relationships as opposed to just cutting people off. When she asked me for these favors recently, I would feel bothered at the time and I would want to say no but I didn't know how to say no without coming off in an emotional way. I don't know how to communicate that I don't like this behavior in a way that would be clear without carrying anger/resentment or making the other person feel defensive.

946,c9t2py,gentlywithachainsaww,"Porn, drugs, and facebook messaging","So let me start by saying that I have never in my life been controlling of any man I’m with, and never been so insecure in my life until being with the guy I’m with now. 

So when we started dating he knew my history of being cheated on and trust issues. Acted like he’d “tear down those walls”. Fast forward to many many many arguments later, because he has an anger management problem and a personality disorder, and it has turned emotionally abusive. 

There are so many little lies that he tells that I can’t decipher the truth anymore. 

He shared selfies back and forth with “an old friend” on FB, he requests hot girls and then when confronted says “oh i needed to ask about a friend of mine if he’s alive”, and will pick out a woman out of a comment section and start a private message saying “Been so long, blah blah”. He admitted the flirting was wrong, but the other shit continues.

He uses people for things, and I always suspected he wasnt rele attracted to me and all this time has been using me for my car. Now I found out he’s been taking steroids. This fucks with an already weird sex life because he takes other unperscribed drugs that fuck with him cumming. He takes forever to get hard for me but pops boners on the couch at random. He told me porn does nothing for him but I found a ton of it on his phone today. I cant make him cum but porn can apparently. It’s like why lie? Just tell me youre not attracted to me anymore and can’t get there with me. Nobody’s gonna bother with porn knowing they can’t cum like he claims he can’t because of the drugs. 

I dont know what to do or think anymore. Please give me some insight.",2019-07-06 12:29:36,9,6,relationship_advice
947,c9yqtf,Pisseidon,"My (F, 22) Step-Father (M, 39) always seems annoyed when he’s with my mom (F, 40) and I?","Every single weekend we go out and we go shopping or something, he always has an attitude. I used to put up with it because he has a labor intensive job and I figured all he wants to do is hang out at home because he’s tired but I’ve had enough of it. I don’t understand why he ALWAYS has to have a sour face and a bad attitude. 

I often wonder if he sees hanging out with my mother and I as a chore. There are tons of people who have the same occupation as him and make time to hang out with their families but he always tries not to stray too far from home just so he can run home, park his ass on the couch and drink all weekend. I don’t even know why he offers to come as he usually just gives my mom and I money as a gesture to leave him alone for the day. 

My biological father is a deadbeat who I no longer speak to and while my step-father has took his place for about seven years, he seems to think that being a human ATM is the extent of his fatherly duties and I just don’t know how to handle it anymore? At this point I’d rather stay home just to avoid dealing with him.

948,c9s7vp,keanuleaves22,My mum has been telling all her friends about my issues,"So I’ve been having a pretty rough time right recently. I got diagnosed with GAD and depression, I got emotionally abused by the girl I was seeing and it really crushed me a little bit, having to do a job I really just don’t want to be doing. Not trying to throw a pity party this is just the way it’s been. 

I tell my mum about a lot of things. She’s kinda the only person I have to talk to about it. But the problem is she kinda turns it all into her own issue, sorta tries to guilt trip me every time I talk to her but saying ‘oh nothing I ever say fixes it any way’ or getting a bit passive aggressive when I say that a suggestion probably won’t work for me. She has this way of making me feel like it’s all my fault. I came home yesterday for the weekend and she’s just been extremely short with me and I think it’s because I had a bad day yesterday and had to call her to talk it through. I’m starting to think that a lot of my issues stem from her tbh. But I digress.

These are issues I obviously don’t want people to know about who I’m not very close with. But today i saw some messages on her phone about it and she had been going, in detail, into the issues I’ve been having with her friends. People who are the parents of some of my friends, who would definitely tell their sons and daughters. Probably half my town knows by now. 

Don’t get me wrong, I know she needs an outside source to unload to, but I really feel like this is a complete breach of my trust. I don’t feel like I can talk to her anymore and that’s quite tough for me because I have no one else to talk to. Not sure what to do. Should I bring it up with her? Should I just stop talking to her about things. She gets mad and anxious when I don’t. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to hurt her at all, she’s had issues in the past herself. But I actually find this really hurtful that a load of other people now know I’ve been abused by a woman and have depression, which honestly is kinda embarrassing when all your friends are big sports dudes. 

Any advice or thoughts? I love my mum I really do and I don’t want to make things worse for her. I don’t want to feel like I’m being a big weight on my family too, which I’m starting to feel like

Last sunday I saw him again after two years in a group of people. At night, (he somehow got my number), he called me up and asked me out. I told him yes, so we went on a date the day before yesterday. 

We went to eat at a restaurant and had a nice talk. I told him i was still a bit hurt from my last breakup 4 months ago, and had trust issues. After dinner we went for a walk, and he grabbed my hand. I freaked out in my head at this point but i told myself to be calm as this is a nice guy and i should give him a chance. He brought me back home and that was that.

Yesterday, he first told me he missed me, so that's when i clearly stated that i thought he was nice but i needed to take things real slow and i would prefer to get to know eachother better first (I said this quite literally). A couple hours later, he told me he missed me again. This morning, again ( I never said it back). 

Now this guy is an artist, and this afternoon he texted me a picture of  graffiti art that he made. My name. 2x4 meters on a wall. I am freaking out and i dont know what to say, i genuinly want to get to know him better but he is driving me away with all this crazy stuff. We only had ONE date!

951,c9vz1c,Notdzdjusconfused,Ex boyfriend or boyfriend wont pick up his house keys?!,"Hello,

I need help but I dont have anyone to talk to. My boyfriend and I share a two year old daughter. He got upset with me and left back to his mothers house. Within six days he has ignored me all but a couple texts here and there and said we shouldn't be together but wouldn't tell me if we were broken up. I asked him what the status of our relationship was and he refused to answer. He stated that he will pay rent in the tenth. I had to quit my job due to child care and we are moving from Hawaii to the mainland, so were are preparing for that. He is supposed to come with us. He also for some reason asked me if the vehicle, my vehicle as it is in my name, was clean... I answered clean enough how come? To which he ignored me. The next day, I asked him why he was ignoring me and if it was just to hurt me more. Instead of replying he asked if I can drop off our daughter to see him...which I did. When I dropped off our daughter I asked him, are we broken up because I dont want to look stupid if he has moved on to someone else. He yelled at me ""what the fuck I'm not with anyone""...then repeatedly told me ""BYE"", I gathered some bags of clothes that his mother was letting me keep at their home but I decided to bring them back to my house because I dont live there....I noticed he pulled out my favorite belt. Its unisex and he wears it often. He pulled it out and laid it in the floor as if to prepare to put it on. I left anyway as he was yelling at me bye. When he dropped off our daughter to my home, he seemed nicer but his mother and my roommate were there. He asked if baby needed anything and I said that my mother will get some necessities. And he looked at me like he wanted to say more but said ""K"". I get inside and found that he forgot his house keys in our daughters diaper bag. I texted that he forgot his keys and the response was he will have to get them a different time. He also didnt return my belt. It has been 4 days and he has yet to get them. Or talk to me at all. Hasn't even asked about our child. But that is not abnormal for him sadly, what's abnormal is the house keys and my belt...any insight as to why he would not pick up his house keys and give me back my belt? What does it sound like to you? Please help. I love him so much but why wont he answer me if we are broken up, why wouldn't he pick up his keys or give me back my belt? I know it's stupid asking questions like this but I literally have no one to talk to.

I do want to add that he is particular about his keys of course. He needs them to get into the house he lives in. And he knows how much I love my belt. We've bickered lightheartedly over it.


I want to add, hes done this before. When hes upset with me he ignores me for days. Then comes back and we talk about it.  But I'm trying to decide to put up with this any longer.


I'll add this here

He can be immature. But hes always mean to me when hes mad. I did make a mistake though. What started it was that he was to move in with me and my roommate. This was on. Wednesday. He got off work at 4pm was supposed to head to my house which is 20 minutes away after work. Due to hawaii traffic it can take about an hour and half to get here during traffic hours. He decides he wanted to wash clothes and get his hair cut. We were excited to see him, waited for him and he came to our house at about 830pm. My roommate has an abusive ex husband and asked me to go with her to pick up her children. I asked my childs father if he could watch our daughter while I go with my roommate to pick up her children. There wouldn't have been enough room for all of us to go. He had just gotten back to us. But I still decided to go. He did day it was ok but his energy was off. He said I had an hour only. I said ok, we should be back by then. We are driving and he starts to text me that that I didnt want him back and he didnt want to be there and I'm dumb. He doesnt care that she needs to pick up her kids, that I didnt need to be there, etc. I told him I was sorry and that I'll go back as soon as possible. My roommate ended up picking up only one child and drove me all the way back to our house just so I could be back. When I walked in the room he said I'm driving him to work(he doesnt have a car but theres a bus system in hawaii) in the morning and that hes moving back to his moms, even though he just got here. I was hoping he would cool down after sleeping. Well in the morning, he woke me up, ""You ready?!"". I asked him if he was coming back, he said he cant afford it. We agreed he would pay rent but with the driving and traffic from town to the west side gas can be expensive. But he wouldn't say if we were broken up. So I took him to work. A 20 minute drive in the morning took about an hour and a half because of traffic. I didnt bother him all day. But the next day i got so frustrated from being treated this way. I love him and he isnt bad or mean often. It just he doesnt communicate when hes upset. Anyway, I texted him that I hate being treated so poorly, so I told him I didnt like it. That it isnt fair and its emotional abuse. I never said anything about breaking up....but he texted, you right we shouldn't be together. I told him I never said that. I told him that I wanted to be treated with more respect and if he doesnt want the relationship to say you dont want it or say you do...he didnt respond. He told me that he would pay rent on the tenth. Then the next day asked me if my car was clean. He usually washes the car before we go beach or whatever. When I responded, its clean enough how come? He didnt respond. I got frustrated because why the hell would he randomly as me if the car was clean?? I said why do you ask me questions to ignore me? And he texted he wanted me to drop off baby. I suggested I can grab my clothes from his moms house and he responded ,""K"". And you know the rest... but what upset him was that right after he got to the house I left. I apologized and admit it wasnt the best idea. I really didnt have to go. But my roommate is the owner of the house, so there was a little pressure and it took my childs father so long to get to us. I had texted him before hand but he didnt get the text until after he arrived.
 does this everytime hes upset. He ignores me and comes back then talks about it. But it seems like it's getting longer and longer. Even though the longest was a month but there was another issue involved at that time. And he refuses to apologize. The only time he apologized was when he made me take a picture if our daughter at the park because he didnt believe that I was at the playground alone. He thought I was meeting someone there. He apologized for acting ridiculous in that instance. He has severe anxiety and he is insecure.


Thank for everyone who took the time to reply...he saw a picture of me and our daughter. To which he replied, ""you girls look beautiful""...I dont get it. But I'll give him time.",2019-07-06 17:12:02,20,2,relationship_advice
952,c9vyai,issa_throaway_68419,"I (21 M) want to break up with my gf (21 F), but I don't feel confident enough to go through with it or do it","Throwaway just in case

&amp;#x200B;

Before I get into it, myself and my girlfriend have been together for just under 3 years and we're in our early 20's and we both live with our respective families in a small town. The reason for wanting to break up is that we've become different people on a fundamental level, different goals for life, different tastes in most things, different values, different priorities. At the time when we began dating she was very dependent on me and I was very independent. Three years later it's like she's grown into herself which coincidentally means she's grown away from me. We don't make time to see each other and I don't feel like I want to any more, I felt a love at the beginning but now I don't feel it nearly as much. I don't mean that as in ""the honeymoon phase has passed and now I don't like her as much"", I genuinely don't feel nearly as much affection towards her now.  


I'm incredibly happy to see her not be as dependent on others, she's out and doing her own thing most of the time, but I'm not getting anything from the relationship anymore, and we've spoke about this to each other on two occasions in the past and we sort of pushed it off and said ""we'll give it until x date or until y is over"".  I've been feeling like I want to break up with her for a good amount of time now, but the thought had crept up at different times in the past also. I haven't done it yet because I couldn't find the right time/place/way to do it, etc.  


Here's where my problem comes in, I don't want to hurt her and I don't know how to *break up with her*. I want the event to hurt her as little as possible after the fact. What I mean by that is I don't want to do it in a café that she might want to go to in the future, I don't want to do it close in time to an event or an outing where it'll be on her mind. In that same light I'm afraid that I won't be able to stick to my guns and falter under the intense emotions that she'll go through, which will result in me once again settling for ""just wait until such and such a time and see then"".  


What do I do? Or if you were in my shoes, how would you do it?  


P.S.: I apologise if this post is a bit all over the place, please ask me any questions on things that aren't clear. I'm an incredibly anxious mess at the minute.",2019-07-06 17:10:10,1,2,relationship_advice

once we finished playing i kept contemplating asking again. i couldn’t hold it in so i asked, “what did she say?” but he ignored the question so i’m trying to stop thinking about it. it’s just so hard. i feel like it may have been something that might make me jealous so maybe he didn’t feel comfortable telling me. because jealousy is a problem with is sometimes but i don’t really do anything when i’m jealous. i barely tell him when i am. so i don’t know.

954,c9yhjr,jeter-weg,Torn between passion and stability [23f],"(The usual, throwaway, on mobile, etc.)

Hoo boy have I really done it this time.

My now-husband and I have been having some relationship issues recently, mostly centering around the fact that he doesn't give me enough attention (as in, barely any at all). He's studying super hard for his bar exam right now (which is in a couple weeks), but this has been an ongoing thing that I just couldn't put words to until recently. We had a huge fight about it the other day, wherein he said I was ""immature"" and ""not capable of being an adult"", but we've gotten over the fight for the most part. Problem is, despite multiple instances of me bringing it up, I get very little attention from him and even less physical contact (I get similar from my dad, kisses excepted). This would all be fine and good and well and we'd work on it but here's the thing: before I met Husband (we'll call him Luke), I had a boyfriend (Dave). I met Dave at school, and we had a kinda sorta thing for a little while (2-3 months) until he broke up with me, because I was ""too nice"" and ""he wasn't sure he had those kinds of feelings for me"" which is totally valid. We're still friends, though, and Dave is one of the only people who has ever seen me at my absolute lowest, and actually understands my struggles (eating disorder/s, no worries, I'm pretty much recovered now!). Hubby Luke, however, doesn't seem to understand my EDs, no matter how I explain it (he once asked me in all seriousness if my binge-food cookies called at me from the shelf, as  in, talk to me). He's a good man, my husband, but he's also decided on a very time-intensive career and I fear he is not able to prioritise me to the point that I need to be. Again, I'm not asking him to never study for his exam or never take time to process or never have ""me"" time for himself, I just also need a little attention, and a little physical contact for heck's sake. Luke and I only very recently got married, mostly due to visa/residency issues on my end (but we did discuss beforehand all the prerequisite stuff before deciding to do this). I'm afraid I might have made a mistake? Dave and I hadn't seen each other much recently (different majors in school), and recently got together for a while to play some video games. We talked about a lot of things, and I couldn't bring myself to tell him that I was married, though I did mention Luke and I were visiting my family soon. Dave told me a bunch of pretty personal stuff (a great conversation actually), but it basically came to my attention that he's just more... Fun? Than Luke? He's a few years younger (we're all between 23-26, I'm the youngest), but I miss the passion I had with him, and I could tell he does too. In honesty, if I hadn't found Luke a year and a half ago, I would gladly try again with Dave. He makes me feel electric whenever we're together, and he's a much more touch-y (as in, likes physical contact a lot) person than Luke. I'm so torn up and I don't know what to do, I need some advice but I don't know who to turn to. I know they both care about me, but I'm not sure I made the right choice, marrying my husband. The whole residency thing complicates this even further; I don't know what the rules would be if we would divorce / annulment, and I can't just go back to my home country, this new one has become my home and I cannot imagine ever putting down roots anywhere else.

I wanted to watch a movie so I asked her if she would be interested in. Basically her mom told her that not to go out with me alone because of 1) she doesn't want their relatives to see her with me in public alone  because I'm different religion and they would think we r dating and would cause a huge mess for her 2)Her parents doesn't want me to get to close to her so that she doesn't fall in love with me because I'm different religion . But her mom is ready to send her with me alone if she needs some academic thing done by me. That's what pissed me off. She really cares for her mother and she said she doesn't want to lie anymore when meeting me and I really don't mind. Then I told her "" your mom doesn't want us to be friends so why even be friends because after our academic gets over you will be too busy to text or call and won't even meet because our mom won't let you ."" she said that I'm blaming on her mother. Then I said what else should u do then she said: "" understand the reality "". She keeps saying look from my point of view but I try but I still feel her mom is the problem

960,c9yed0,marblebing,I (F20) want to salvage my relationship with my sometimes distant boyfriend (M19),"Hey, this is my first time posting to reddit, let alone posting about anything this personal. I'm sorry if there's any spelling or formatting mistakes.
I have a boyfriend I've been dating for about 7 months and for most of it, things have been pretty great up until recently. I don't wanna divulge too many details, lest someone I know see this post, but I'll do my best to give you guys all the info I can. 
I met him about a year ago through mutual friends online and talked to him through our group chat and played games with him. He always had a tough life and was abit rough around the edges. I was never romantically interested in him, until I met up with him irl and I fell really hard for him. We had amazing chemistry and he genuinely cared for me, being around him made me the happiest than I had been since I broke up with my ex a year prior. I was apprehensive about getting my heart broken again, but we started dating long distance and planned to meet up again soon. 
My boyfriend has a tough family life so he tends to couch hop with his friends, and has some drug habits, normally this would be a huge deal breaker for me, but it's something I look past in him because I know it's something he wants to improve on. I view it similar to a mental illness, something that shouldn't necessarily be scorned. I'd rather not go into detail about his background due to the private subject matter, but as a result of it he doesn't really have a job. He gets paid by the government and lives in a very small town where employment is scarce.
Him not having a job isn't a big deal to me, as right now I don't have to financially support him, but I still want to be able to see him somehow as flights are expensive. This month he thought he'd be getting a check to come visit but it never came, frustrating me as I splurged a bit assuming that he could pay for it himself. 
If you're still reading this, thanks for listening to the rambly nature of my writing, I'm almost done. The biggest issue for me right now though is the fact that my boyfriend feels distant alot of the times and doesn't always text back soon. We used to call every single day, now it feels far and in-between. I ask him Multiple times a day, as I love spending time with him, but sometimes I feel like I'm not a priority in his life and that maybe he prioritizes drugs over me. I don't want to say this to him however, as I don't want to accuse him of something like that and make him believe I don't trust him and resent him, which I don't. I love him very much, I'm just sick of waiting for him to come around and spend time with me. I try to avoid ranting to him because part of me believes whatever he has to deal with is more difficult than what I'm going through. Despite what it looks like here, he's a great guy and one of the most genuine people I've ever met, I value having him around and wanna fix things.

962,c9ye4o,klonikebar,Alcoholic bf picking fights,"(Disclaimer: he was drunk our entire trip and is drinking daily) 
So about a month ago my boyfriend and I went to Alabama for a friends wedding. We were there from Thursday to Sunday. Thursday was fine but Friday he got weird on me
(Weird meaning didn’t wanna talk to me, look at me, he stayed in bed all day etc.) his friends were asking me where he was all day and I had no clue what to tell them

I asked him what was wrong and he yelled at me and said nothing

So the night of the wedding rolls around and all is going well from what I could tell 
We were leaving to head home to Nevada the next day.
We walk into the hotel room we were staying at and he slams the bathroom door in my face. I then lose what little patience I had at this point and asked him what was wrong. He throws his cigarettes at me while I’m talking and then Passes out drunk while I was having a conversation with him. 

We get home and I decide to take a few days to myself. I took Sunday Monday and Tuesday to give myself some time to relax and recharge.
I text him on Tuesday and ask if he’s feeling better he says no. This cycle of me texting him and him not feeling good continues until Thursday, I call him Thursday and Friday night and he declines my calls and refuses to talk to me. 

(Im thinking someone died, or he lost his job) I’m very worried about him at this point. So show up to his place and knock on the door on Friday. I tell him you’ve got to talk to me, I’m really worried. 
He replies, it’s nothing I want to tell or talk to you about. I ask how much he’s had to drink that week and he says it’s irrelevant 

So I leave frustrated because he won’t talk to me.
I call him Saturday night and say hey let’s do nothing and just relax. Get your mind off of things

He said he had to make one phone call before I come over

It turns out his ex had been texting him and he said it got him all up in this mood. She wanted him back and according to him he has no want or need to talk to her, but she wasn’t blocked at this point.

We broke up made up and ever since then he’s been picking fights with me. Things I say, things I do, looking at my phone, etc etc 

I’m so confused and typically pretty confident in myself. I don’t know what to do with this guy. 

Is he knocking boots with this woman, is he just a drunk, wtf is going on... I don’t take him as the cheating type",2019-07-06 20:42:05,3,1,relationship_advice
963,c9ycq3,saisbinodm,How to support a brother (19M) who compares himself to me (21F),"(obligatory throwaway - brother, if you see this, hi!)

Me and my brother have always been quite opposite. In school we were both smart, but he was more socially smart and had a lot of friends while doing well in class and did a lot of sports, I was top of my class but had no friends and was bullied over how uncoordinated I was (like, I couldn't play catch until I was in my teens). He was outgoing and wanted to try new things, I was fussy and scared of everything unusual. I was always so jealous of him! We were never that close because our interests were so different.

About 4 years ago I finally grew up. I got a few friends and started trying new things. I had struggled with self esteem for a long time, but suddenly gained confidence, which included getting the test marks I needed to get into a top university. Honestly I feel awesome these past few years. I've had less contact with my brother since moving away.

A couple of years ago my parents let me know that my brother has always been jealous of me because I'm good academically, and in the past few years especially I've become more adventurous than he's ever been. They asked me not to talk about university or my new experiences much in front of him. A few times, he has asked me to help him on academic stuff, such as by helping edit essays for him, and I have tried, but he tends to get defensive, and I might be too critical. We don't see each other much as I am away at uni or travelling most of the time he is at home. He is definitely growing more mature, and we have some good discussions. But if I seem smarter than him in the discussions, he gets insecure about it.

This summer seems like it will be particularly awkward. I now have a boyfriend, and he's still never had a girlfriend, which he's annoyed by. I've had a few jobs and done a lot of volunteering, while his CV is still empty. I'm starting my summer holiday on vacation with my boyfriend hiking through Europe, and according to my mum, he's jealous of that too. I was sending pictures to the family WhatsApp group until my parents privately told me to stop as my brother was getting jealous. And these are not comparisons I am thinking about like ""oh, these are all the ways I am better than him"" - these are things either he or my parents have commented on.

And most importantly he just failed to get into the universities he wanted, getting significantly lower on the tests than I did. It's a really easy comparison to make. And he's going to be hurt by it.

I love my brother and I want him to do well in life. But I want to do well in life too, and I'm proud of how I'm doing. I want to support him. I really feel bad about my successes causing so much insecurity for him, but at the same time I want to celebrate because I worked so hard and I've come really far. But I don't want to celebrate around him as it might be running his face in it, but if I celebrate without him, he tends to find out and get jealous that I didn't want to share my experiences with him.

What's the best way to support him in a time that must be really frustrating for him, that I can't really empathise with right now, and also how to approach this perceived gap between us in the future?",2019-07-06 20:38:33,2,1,relationship_advice

967,c9spua,[deleted],Ending my(23F) relationship with my BF(25M) over something that happened before we started dating? kind of?," 

Hey there reddit! using a throw away!

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years. We have a dog and we've bee living together for the last year. We actually met on Tinder and hit it off from there. Eventually, the topic comes up on whether or not we went out with anybody else from the app. I divulge that I had gone on a few coffee dates but nothing really beyond that. On the other hand, he told me that I was the only person that he had met on the app and of course the only one he'd ever been intimate with.

Tinder has a fun little function that will allow you to follow your matches on instagram so now he has all these girls lurking around on there. Okay, whatever I thought most of them were his friends from school anyway. Eventually I start to notice he's very friendly with this one girl in particular so I ask him about it and if it's a girl from tinder he says it's nothing and they're just friends. Alright! I trust this guy so okay. I have a small inkling that he's lying because they appear to have no interactions until the same year he moved down here and I think that's a bit curious.

So summer get's here and he's off to work during his break about 2,000 miles away while I continue with school. A few weeks after he's left we get into a bit of an argument and I finally just crack and ask him if that girl is someone he met on tinder and I tell him to just tell me the truth because I know he's been lying. After a while he admits that this girl was from tinder and that they had met up and kissed. Wow okay kind of a shocker that you lied for almost 4 years but we can get through this. He told me he talked to this girl for a little while during our relationship but they were strictly platonic. It's something I was upset about but not anything I was going to break up with him for.

We're talking about what to do next and blah blah when he tells me he can't hold it in any longer and he has something else to tell me. Eventually he finally tells me that he actually didn't kiss here, they went back to her place and had sex. They just weren't compatible and decided to stay friends. Well now I'm completely taken aback. How does somebody lie for almost 4 years like that! and something so small that wouldn't of even been a big deal if he would of just told me when we talked about it at the beginning of our relationship.The part that upset me the most was that he was still talking to her, platonic or not, while he was lying to me. Things get even weirder because when I asked to see the messages, he said he had deleted them so he wouldn't have to explain it? I'm not sure, I don't remember his exact words. I really don't think he would cheat on me, besides this little incident he's never done anything to make me feel like that way. He's at school 5 days a week with long hours so I'm not even sure he has time? I love this guy and I want to make it work but are there just too may red flags or am I just being controlling?

**TLDR**

Boyfriend and I met on tinder and he said I was the only person he'd met on there. Turns out he's been lying about a few things including that he met up with a girl on tinder and they had sex before we got together. They decided to be platonic and they still talk from time to time but when I asked him about the girl the first time, he deleted their messages so he wouldn't have to explain",2019-07-06 11:45:41,18,5,relationship_advice
968,c9vkp8,BrewskisWithARuskie,Follow Up to Previous Post: ‘I (20M) think my coworker (19F) has a crush on me...’,"Hey all, it’s ya boi Ruskie, back again with yet another post about my confusing love life. A lot of this will refer back to my last post, which I’ll link below. Basically, I talked about one of my coworkers and how I believe that she treats me a little differently than the rest of us because she might have a crush on me. Earlier this week, she texts me and asks if I’m having a party (side note: I have parties after work sometimes during the summer, and I wanted to have one this week but I went on vacation today), and I told her I was not able to throw one. We got to talking and we made plans to go Pokémon hunting Tuesday night after I get off from work. I get done around 8:45, I get dressed and head over to her house, pick her up, and we go Pokémon hunting til one in the morning. Like I mentioned with the last time we hung out one-on-one, it was 100% platonic, but I still had an insanely fun time (and caught a shiny Alolan Exeggutor, so def not too bad). While driving around with her, I noticed that sometimes she would laugh at nothing, the way my ex would laugh when we would drive around together. She might have just been having a good time, but none of my other really good friends and best friends would seemingly laugh and smile out of nowhere while being with me. 

I also want to mention a small part I forgot in my last story. She told me she gets nervous around guys she’s attracted to. I thought this ruled me out, and that I would lose her to my coworker, but she is very talkative to him. This is what makes me think she really doesn’t like him, since she’s just as comfortable around him as she is me and my other male coworkers. This could also mean she doesn’t like me either, and I am honestly fine with that at this point. I have legitimately spent a lot of time thinking this stuff over and it’s stressing me out, and I really want closure. 

The next events happen a few times over the course of the past few days since my last post. She likes to hug people, but she doesn’t hug me as often. I jokingly asked her why, and she told me because she always sees me, so she doesn’t need to hug me so often. The last time she hugged me though, she said I was warm and soft like a teddy bear. However, she always hugs other (male) hosts and servers near the host stand where I work, and I don’t know if I’m reading way too much into this, but whenever she hugs them, it’s like she’s always looking straight into my eyes like she’s expecting me to get jealous or something. She made a deal with another guy in the kitchen that when the kid she hates who comes in often and tries to hit on her comes in to order a burger, he will pretend to be her fake bf. I know this means nothing, as the kid already knows that I’m not dating her so it wouldn’t make sense for me to be her ‘bf’. She also told me she only likes this guy from the kitchen in a platonic way. 

She invites me and a bunch of hosts and servers over her house on Thursday, where we drink, sing and sit around a fire all night. Remember her fake bf I mentioned earlier? Well, he doesn’t have a car, so she goes to pick him up since he’s not far. At one point he steals her seat, so she sits on his lap (he ways 120 lbs soaking wet, prob the same as her lol) and vice versa. She was also quite tipsy when this happened so I know it’s not romantic. However, and I know some will tell me that I’m reading into this, but constantly for the three hours I’m there, she is constantly staring at me and dancing near me. At one point she grabs my water, asks if it’s mine, and then chugs half of it (again, I know she was drunk but idk what to think of it). I leave soon after, she wishes me goodbye and I take off so I may wake up at 4:30 to catch my 8 AM flight this morning. I would also like to mention the other server she DOES like did not attend the party. 

While this is the end of my stories, I want to tell you about some advice I’ve gotten, namely two pieces of advice. The first is from my female friends, who all told me that I should tell her my feelings and be honest with her; even if she doesn’t like me, it will clear my mind and set the record straight. The second is from my dad, who told me that, since we are great coworkers and becoming really good friends, I shouldn’t say anything and leave it be. I am not sure who to believe, as they both give conflicting advice. As I have said in my last post, something like this has never happened to me before and I’m unsure of how to approach this without losing her as a potential partner AND friend. 

Thanks for reading, I know both of these posts have been a slog to get through. I’m confused on what direction to go, as I don’t want to screw things up. I appreciate all comments, even ones that tell me things that I might not want to hear. Have a great day guys, I appreciate you all!

969,c9y50w,MoonElf19,Just found out the guy (27M) I (27F) was trying to date is in a relationship with my best friends fiance (27F).,"I mean. It's complicated. It's messy. That's why I'm here.  

TLDR at the bottom-- sorry, this is all really fresh and I might have word vomited.

I've been interested in a guy, N, since last November. He's in my friends group, I started to get to know him and feelings developed. Revealed that I was developing feelings at the end of last year, and he gave me a soft rejection where he said he had some personal issues to work through, which I was already aware of.

Fast forward to April, we start hanging out more. I'm not very confident, so I couldn't be sure if he was sending me signals or not. I'm patient though, and it's not like I have a ton of prospects, so I just kept pursuing a friendship. Of course, my feelings only intensify. 

Around June I started leaning on my friends, M (31 M) and K (27F from title), who are engaged and had become super close to me since last year. They 100% tell me that it sucks to be rejected and that they hope I move on. This makes me feel worse, since N pretty much lives at their place most of the time. They know him better than anyone. If they are telling me he isn't interested, he probably isn't interested. 

About a month or so ago N tells me over dinner that he has been doing a lot better, and making a lot of progress, and he's really liking where his life is going. I get nervous, because I'm not sure if he is trying to tell me something. I continue to hear about how well N is doing, and he starts showing me more affection. I still believed M and K that he wasn't interested though.

A week ago N is at my place and he makes a move on me. He says he's super into me, we go to bed, fade to black. Afterwards, he starts feeling guilty and saying he doesn't want to be a douchebag, but he can't commit to a relationship with me right now. That this was a one-time thing. I should have clarified before what was going on, because if I had known that I wouldn't have been with him, but then again I've only had one serious boyfriend before. I trusted that N wouldn't make that move unless he wanted more, since that's what he knew I wanted. I assured him that it was ok, but I made it very clear that I wasn't going to give up on a relationship with him. That I would start to ""court"" him, and prove I could be a good partner, and we could start going on dates. 

We saw each other a lot this last week. Mostly with M and K along as well. The first time I saw M, he asked how I was doing and I revealed what had happened and how I'm conflicted but hopeful that we could make it work. M made noncommital noises and told me not to get my hopes up and reiterated that N shouldn't be in a relationship right now. I disagreed, I said that even people who are struggling with life shit deserve a chance at a partner and happiness, and I wanted that for N. 

I made plans to spend some time with N on the fourth. I was excited, thinking this would be a good chance to connect with him more, one on one, since whenever K is around she takes up a lot of the room. I loved her, she was super fun and caring, but she also had a big personality. If N and I were connected at all, talking or flirting or anything, and K came into the room, N would get awkward and back off. I thought it was because he didn't really know where our relationship was, and didn't want to answer questions. 

The third of july rolls around and N reveals he just made plans with K to go on what sounds like a date. I was hurt, and N could tell. I explain that I was looking forward to spending time and connecting with him. He insists that he only made plans because he wanted me to come along, and we would hang out one on one afterward. I asked M if he was planning on coming as well, and he begged off.

On the fourth we hung out for a little while but I'm sick and I had to leave early. Before I left N said we probably wouldn't be able to get any one on one time because he was spending the day with K. I was crushed, but I said I understood that hanging out with his friends is important, I just wished that hanging out with me was important too. I was almost to my car and N ran out to talk to me without K, explaining that I was important to him and he did want to see me, that it was important we become good friends and we would talk about dating in the future. I asked him if we could get dinner later, and he agreed and said he was looking forward to it. Dinner went great, and I invited N back to my place, but he said he was tired and wanted to go home.

The fifth: The day it all came crashing down. 

Our group of friends were throwing a party. I showed up a bit late because, again, still sick. N seemed excited to see me, but he was kind of hot and cold. While I'm alone with K I confide in her that N had made a move on me, but it kind of made things worse because now I was even more invested and I have to just trust him. K immediately asks if I made a move on him or if he made a move on me, and I remind her that I already made my move, half a year ago, and N definitely initiated things last week. K pushes hard that I move on, even if it means not seeing N for a while. She says if there's anyone else I can spend time with that I should do that. She says that N doesn't really spend alone time with anyone but her, and I shouldn't expect him to trust me or like me that much. Basically she shuts my hopes down hard. But now I know N is at least sort of interested in me, so all of a sudden a lot of K's behavior the last half a year start setting off alarms.  

I told N what K advised me, to drop him hard. He looks concerned, and insists that isn't necessary but he will respect what I want, but he wants me in his life. But he reiterates he can't commit to me. 

I got a bit drunk, everyone else got really drunk. At once point N and K disappear, and it took me a little while to notice. I found them cuddling on a couch, practically asleep. Again, I shrugged it off- they are super close friends. I asked if they needed any water, went about my business. Eventually it gets late, and N seemed less and less interested in me at all, so I decided to leave. I got out to my car and M came to find me. He's basically my best friend at this point, we play video games together and talk all the time about everything. He told me he was really sorry I got caught up in all of this, that he wishes he could help me somehow but he can't, and he wanted me to know he would always be there for me. 

I reveal that I'm struggling to feel wanted, and that it feels like K is N's top priority, and how can I compete with that close of friendship. After some prying I found out that M and K have an open relationship, and K has been dating N pretty much the whole time I've known them. 

I almost threw up. I felt like a total idiot-- I still feel like an idiot. They made me look like a fool. All of them. I couldn't believe how trusting I had been, and how they had taken advantage of that. 

I went home and jumped onto a video game to distract myself. M showed up online a few minutes later, and we had some fun and got my mind off of things. Then I hear K and N come into the room, like two hours later, over voice chat. They are sleepy and giggly. I suddenly realize how many times I'd heard that same thing. How many times they were fucking while I was playing video games with M. 

**TL/DR**

**I've been trying to date N for half a year. My feelings are pretty strong. K has always pushed that I get over N, and stop hanging out with him, for my own good. M accidentally revealed that K and N are in a relationship.** 

Advice Request:

How tf do I move forward. Our entire friends group either knew or had an idea that I was trying to date N. I was also usually the one to instigate our friends hanging out, I was the one to make plans. And K and M were always at the center of those plans. I don't think anyone else has any idea that K and N are together. 

There isn't anything N can do to earn back my trust, except maybe cut K out of his life. And I can't ask him to do that, since she is a huge support for him while he deals with some shit. Neither would he literally ever pick me over her-- she's hot, she isn't disabled, she's been his friend for years. Why would he ever want me over her?

N and I made plans to hang out next week. If I see him I might throw up, or start crying.

I'm not supposed to know about K and N. If N bothers to ask why I'm pulling away, how can I possibly convey how much he's hurt me without throwing M under the bus? Should that even bother me, since he knew the whole time as well and never told me? This could probably fit into AITA as well, since I feel like if I confront anyone then I'm going to be the bad guy. 

Should I just keep my mouth shut and stop hanging out with K and N? M said he's willing to spend time with me without them. 

Should I post in the group chat that K and N made a fool out of me and led me on? My brother thinks they have been serious assholes. 

Should I swallow my feelings and see what N does? He seems to be trying to land two girlfriends at once, but I likely threw a wrench in that plan last night by telling K everything. She disappeared and wanted to be alone for a while after I told her. I don't think she knew about N and me getting together, and I'm kind of curious if she is ok with it. I doubt they were exclusive, but I don't know if N is the kind of person to not tell his long term partner about a fling he had. 

I definitely don't think I can be in a relationship with N. The kind of person who plays those games is not the kind of person I want to associate with. 

 Finally: How the hell do I try and have friendships with people, let alone date, when I've been screwed over so many times, and this one has basically destroyed my trust of people? The only reason I didn't relapse on self-harming last night was because my brother stayed up talking to me and convincing me not to.",2019-07-06 20:19:53,4,0,relationship_advice
970,c9y4ta,ac775,Gaining self respect back after being used by someone?,"Just looking for some tips. The girl I was seeing really just used me as an emotional and sexual tampon. She led me on the whole time. She had 0 respect for me, everything was always about her, and then she just dropped me after she realised that she wasn’t going to get much more out of me without some sort of effort on her part.  She then ghosted me. 

I’ve been trying to build myself back up since then. I’ve tried everything from new hobbies, meeting new people, dates, even therapy. None of it’s working I still just feel down all day. Not sure I even want to be with someone anymore ever, when it was something I really wanted before this girl. Problem is I still really like her, and I’m just sad I’m not with her every day. Even after all the abuse. The thought of her with other people really just kills me. How am I meant to respect myself when I think like that.

971,c9y4rw,redeyesredbull,"Is it normal to cuddle and kiss all day in a friend’s with benefits relationship, sometimes not even having sex?","There’s this boy that I’ve had a crush on for forever. After several rejections, we ended up becoming friends with benefits. When he comes over, we cuddle and kiss all day long. He swears we’re not in a relationship; that we’re not compatible. We text all day long. All night long. He knows my family well. But nobody knows what we do. He is very adamant about keeping it hidden (I know for a fact he’s not cheating on someone else with me, trust me.). 

I used to have mental breakdowns about him and one of us would call off the relationship and become “just friends” again, but it never lasted. Longest it lasted was a week. Either he gets horny, or I miss him too much. The truth is, he is probably is bad for me, but I’d so much prefer it over nothing. I’d miss him way too much to lose him. He doesn’t know this because I have very persistently explained otherwise, but I still really like him. To anyone with over two brain cells it would be obvious by the way I act and how I always want to see him, but I guess he just believes me. 

 I’ve never been in a fwb relationship before him, or even a relationship in general so I don’t understand where the line is. Is the way we act when we’re alone normal?",2019-07-06 20:19:13,4,1,relationship_advice
972,c9y40k,HeThrowHawaii,Can I (23M) stop having feelings for my crush (23F)?,"Hello, I am a 23 y.o male and my question is: can I stop loving a person? Can i stop having romantic feeling for someone without becoming a stranger to her?  
Context: i met her in High School, almost 9 years ago, and I fell in love the following year, I know many will say that it was not love, just a simple high school crush, (my relatives said the same) but I never stopped thinking about her: not after I tried (and failed) to date her, not after I dated other crushes of mine, not even when i was in a relationship; I always thought about her, I still think about her and i want to stop. Simply speaking getting with her like in my fantasies is impossible, both hers and my study and career choices led/will led to us being always moving from one side of the continet to the other. But those fantasies prevents me to move on and find someone else, the relationship I mentioned before ended (in part) because of this.  
I want this to end but I don't want to cut all ties with her, she genuinely is one of the best person I ever knew and one incredible friend, but I want it to end there, being good friends, but i cannot think how.  
This post will sound **very** dramatic, but I am absolutelyin the dark and I need help. i tried asking my relatives about it, but they dismissed the whole thing as ""just a crush"" or me being obsessed. thanks in advance to everyone willing to help

973,c9y3uw,Throwaway-Advice0987,Girlfriend not respecting my wishes,"I have some advice to ask and I’m thankful for anyone who replies to this.

Me and my girlfriend have been together for 3 months now so we are still in our early stages.

I’m currently coming to terms with having an alcohol addiction, in which I am seeking treatment and help to battle.  My girlfriend has noticed that there’s one or two days that I won’t reply to her messages for pretty much the whole day (as I’ll be in working on improving myself through online courses and my online therapist, as I currently work in a country where alcohol is illegal) and I tell her it’s nothing for her to worry about as I don’t feel like I’m ready to tell her yet about my addiction.

However the answers I give her are not good enough for her and she continually keeping asking me what I have been doing over and over again (I counted, she’s asked me that question 93 times in the last 24 hours). Like I said I’m not ready to tell her yet, and I do want to tell her but only when I feel ready.  

Her continually questioning has obviously created tension and has been a cause for arguing recently, to the point where I am seriously considering ending the relationship. How do I get her to stop with the continual questioning and for her to just respect my wishes during what is a hard and challenging time for me?

Thank you again in advance for anyone that helps",2019-07-06 20:17:06,6,1,relationship_advice
974,c9i2rj,UnsureHamburger,[M24] My girlfriend [F25] won't take Plan B after the condom broke and keeps getting upset when I try to give it to her,"Dating for a few months now. We have a very good relationship. Had a bit of a mishap where I noticed the condom had broke. I was like shit, well let me pay you half for the plan B. She keeps saying to not worry about it. Walking her back to her car she became angry because she "" read up on it"" and "" I don't get it"". She just keeps telling me to shut up and stop worrying about it. But I can't, it's my future too and to just be like ""eh hope not!"" Isn't good enough. She said ""I'm not taking it just so you can feel better"". That to me is not the issue here at all.

She has an app on her phone to track her cycles and she has used it for months, it says she isn't ovulating and that there is a low chance. It's fucking retarded to me that she trusts so much in a phone app. Also it's so frustrating that she just tries to shut me up like I'm going crazy.

**UPDATE** : Hey yall. I got a ton of responses from this and I feel like there are some things I didn't quite get. Thanks a ton for all of your views and stories. I noticed some things:

 1. People are SO ready to get angry about birth control and how men don't understand. This is true. We do not.

 2.I have talked with her about how we had bad communication and we have worked through it. She also was so READY to educate my dumb ass on it today rather than last night. I may have just picked the wrong bone at the wrong time. 

**IMPORTANT** Also when I wrote the post I used an incorrect wording for the title. I wrote ""try to give it to her"" and I should have written ""[upset when I ...] try to talk with her about taking it"". Small change in wording but some people have picked that apart. A lot of you guys and gals in the comments have gone at me for forcing her. At most I strongly suggested her to take it considering the circumstances. I understand though. [I knew this before writing this post] **Guys should know the dangers of Plan B and what side effects it has on a girls body**.

975,c9vh13,Javeno,GF (32/f) wanted a break - I (32/m) am unsure how to proceed at this point.,"I met this girl in late September online through a dating website. I fell in love with her on the first date. Many dates followed and things went amazingly well. We're compatible in basically every way. We confessed our love to each other probably three months into dating (something I had never done before). She lives about 1 hour 15 minutes away from me but it's a non-issue as far as the distance goes. Because I have roommates, it's easier for me to go over to her place and she's fine with that. She met my mother (my only family in the state we live in), and I've met nearly all of her family. We've been on two trips that were fantastic. I've never had a relationship go this amazingly well until it didn't. Essentially, Friday night through Sunday night would be our time and it was that way for about 5 months. One day she hit me with the news that she needed a break, or time apart. It did crush me, but I understood why and knew she was probably feeling smothered and needed space and stuff. I didn't call or text, or reach out in anyway (she isn't on social media) until she reached out to me about 20 days later. Since then we've spoken and texted sporadically and I've ever been over to her place to reconnect for a night. I guess I just don't know if I'm wasting my time waiting around for something like this. I'm still madly in love with her but I don't know if this is her way of a soft break up or if things can turn around. I texted her happy 4th and she texted me briefly, then I found out yesterday she was randomly across the country for the first time but didn't say anything. Am I overreacting? Am I wasting time? Am I over thinking this situation? Thank you in advance.",2019-07-06 16:27:58,8,2,relationship_advice

977,c9y0vs,AletaXYZ,I want out of my relationship but get harassed into going back?,"I’m 25 and he is my first boyfriend. Over the few months we’ve been together we’ve been through hell on both ends.

On his end, he had lost his job and identification, his place to stay and ended up at a homeless shelter (a better option I thought than a crack house he was finding shelter in)

On my end my brother and father attacked me two days in a row (my boyfriend watched my dad attack me and try to break my neck in my car) and I had to move out of my mothers house (mom did nothing about either situation, I think she’s afraid of my dad)

I ended up moving from place to place. Nobody I could stay with, my family turned their backs on me and my boyfriend I found was immature as hell, had issues keeping a job and was always playing the victim in situations.

I got tired of all of it, my entire life I’ve lived for other people, done things just to please them because now that I’m on my own, my family refuses to help me in any way, throwing negative comments about my places to live and tearing me down every chance they get.

I’m not ready for a relationship but he wouldn’t hear it, he breaks down crying, he’s trying but what I need right now is not what he’s capable of.

Every time I’ve tried to leave him it’s the same, I don’t really love him, I just wanna please my family like always, I don’t listen to him, and he harasses me until I give in. But once again the same bullshit and I get fed up and want out again. Same cycle.

This time however he’s gone too far, I caught him in a bunch of lies, complements of his brother who does what I used to do, act as his crutch every time he fucks up. His brother told me the truth of how he got thrown out of the house where he lives.

My boyfriend talks a big talk (like my father) but there’s no action behind it, he half asses it and finds excuses not to go to work, doesn’t pay his way anywhere he goes, and does things people tell him not to do. Yet he acts like a victim, people keep abandoning him and he can’t see why.

I have too much on me to be dealing with this shit now. This time around when I told him it was over he threatened suicide. Sent me a video of him about to jump off a bridge, then sent me another saying he hurt his legs.

His brother was trying to move him back in with me (because he doesn’t want to deal with him anymore) and I dumped him for good to get the point across that I’ve had enough. 

How do I get rid of him for good he has texted me on 17 different numbers",2019-07-06 20:09:21,6,1,relationship_advice
978,c9y0a6,hi_pumpkin_girl,my boyfriend is unsure of us :(,"hi,
to get to the point, my boyfriend and i have been arguing the past week or so over stuff in our relationship but we are communicating how we feel. my bf 2 days ago mentioned that he wanted to stop our ft calls that we keep on while we sleep, stop sharing his location on everything, and stuff like that. i said okay, i was a little hurt because it was something we always did since we started dating 3 1/2 years ago. 
so last night he called me and said that he “im not sure if i want to be with you” and “i dont know, i don’t know i just am not sure”. that broke my heart. he says he still loves me and said”it’s not fair to you”, im still unsure exactly what he meant by that. but i do know he’s been under a lot of stress from being evicted with his brother, has to find a place to live today, move out, he has to pay for the apartment now, work, etc., so im thinking maybe he is just stressed and so we both said that we wouldn’t see eachother for about a week to see if the space doesn’t help. he mentioned that he sometimes feels “smothered and claustrophobic” so im hoping this space will help him in realizing that he does want to be with me:( we also had a date planned for today but he said”it feels wrong to go out and have fun when i need to be out of this place by tuesday and stuff” 
so idk, pls help me and give me advice. do you think we will be okay? he hasn’t done anything for me not to trust him at all in our relationship.",2019-07-06 20:08:02,4,1,relationship_advice
979,c9xz3t,TheDiffer23,Did she do me a favor?,"So I've been dating this girl now for upwards of about 3 months. It started when I [23M] was working at my works drive through when this girl [27F] asks me out on a date.
I go on the date with her where she was quickly to tell me that she had a boyfriend, but was seeking  a way out due to him being abusive towards her and her son. Me, being single for about a year and a half dumbly agrees to continue seeing her. I feel like I was a bad influence on her in some ways. Like I helped her get out of her relationship with that dude and move out on her own. Then we went out onmy birthday where we both got stupid drunk. When she was drunk she admitted to me that I broke her 100 day sober streak from Alcohol and that she was addicted to a bunch of other stuff as well. Well...i thought 1 time wouldn't hurt cause it was my birthday. My birthday was may 27th and shes been drinking almost non stop. It isn't even fun drinking with her anymore. She's do bipolar when shes drunk.
First she wants to just dink, have fun and joke around
Second she wants to fuck. Doesn't matter what's going on, where we are, who's there it doesn't matter. She tried having sex with her son literally watching us...no stank you
Third, her emotions are on a flip of a coin. When shes drunk it's either mad, horny, or sad that she mad you mad. I told her I didn't feel comfortable doing anything sexual in front of her kid, or when her kid is up for that matter, and completely blew up on me. The minute I told her I didnt like that, she was instantly back to lovey dovey let's just have fun and chill attitude. 
Rinse and repeat.
That incident happened about a week or so ago. 
Yesterday she started ignoring me out of the blue. I kind of brushed it off thinking she was drunk and lost her phone or busy or whatever. Well today she texts me that she wants to break up because she met someone else doesn't want to cheat on me.
Did I dodge a bullet?
Did she do me a favor? 
When she broke up with me i was sad for like 30 minutes because i really liked her, but goddamn does it feel like a weight was lifted from my shoulders.

981,c9xx43,Hungry_Climate,"My (18F) younger brother (17M) and I constantly fight over noise complaints. I'm really sick of it at this point, and I'm lost as to what to do.","Hey, guys. For several years my younger brother and I have butted heads - he's incredibly loud while I prefer some peace and quiet. We used to spend a lot of time doing normal sibling squabbling stuff when we were younger, but everything has gotten well past that point and we genuinely do not like each other anymore. 

I just recently finished my first semester at a good university only 40 mins away, so I don't need a dorm and I can just live at home. I spend a lot of my time studying, preferably with some quiet, but I don't mind noise such as someone watching TV in the living room, or people over, or whatever. I do feel that my brother is excessively loud and inconsiderate, however. Our rooms are right beside each other, and he has a habit of leaving his room door wide open while he blasts music from a bass-boosted speaker, or take calls at full volume on speaker, watch his shows (also at full volume and on speaker), or play games. It's incredibly disruptive and I've tried asking him to close his door but he becomes really defiant and when he does he'll just increase the volume such that I can STILL clearly hear it through both closed doors. For reference, he's so loud you can hear everything clearly even from the living room, which is on the other side of the house. He will also frequently bring a bunch of friends over who will (not maliciously, mind you) end up blocking my car in or blocking the entrance to the garage such that I can't get my motorcycle out either. I've asked him to tell his friends not to block either my bike or car in whenever they're over, but it still happens. Constantly. I'm getting sick of this, honestly.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried asking my parents, but my mother sympathizes with my brother by saying that he's just trying to enjoy his summer. Great, I want him to enjoy his summer too but he really doesn't need his door open blasting music in my general direction to do that. I've tried to explaining that his closing his door doesn't really affect him - he can still listen to his music, now with the added bonus of my not having to listen to it too. My mother and I have been butting heads about this too, unfortunately, but I don't think she understands how irritating it is because her room is on the other side of the house and she isn't constantly subjected to the noise you get when you're directly next to him. I'm frustrated, and I'm tired. I'd like to move out ASAP, but that will have to wait till after university. Any advice, guys? I don't want to start playing dirty by turning off the wifi but I'm really running out of options here. I've tried to be nice.",2019-07-06 20:00:27,2,1,relationship_advice
982,c9xws8,low_key_edgy,I [21M] just found out my gf [20F] still mostly views our relationship of 6 months as temporary,"Hey, gang.

So I just found out that my gf, for the majority of our relationship, has only ever considered it temporary. Im not certain how she feels now.

However, she talks about us in the future as already having broken up. Things like:

""I will always be with you, even if I'm not there""

""I will never forget about you or these memories we share together""


The ""motive"" for this break up is the following.

So I am on my last year of college and I may have to move when I get done so I can get started on my career. Apparently, this will be ""too difficult"" on us and it will ""inevitably"" lead to us breaking up.

Guys, I was brought to tears for the first time in almost 3 years when I found this out.
