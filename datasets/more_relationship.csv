0,caomx7,aspicer101,My 26yr old GF that has OCD with staring compulsions. I‚Äôm curious if anyone else has experienced or done this? And if so how does it effect your relationship?,"This is my first time dating a person with OCD and truly want to understand it better.

She has the typical OCD symptoms like taping stuff, washing hands, kissing me a number a times, checking the doors, saying I love you a number of times but one thing that I really want to understand is her staring compulsions (or at least I think what that is called) 

So since the beginning of us talking I noticed she tends stares at people (mostly Older or younger men and sometimes Lesbians) while we are  on dates or going out.  At first I didn‚Äôt think anything of it because we‚Äôre all humans and think other people are attractive but I gotten to the point where it happens every time we go out and people tend to get  the wrong idea that she‚Äôs interested in them because she constantly glances or look back at them a number of times. Even had a few waiters try and hit on her because of it. 

Naturally after seeing this number of times I assumed she was checking them out but she explained she doesn‚Äôt know why she does it. She automatically does it with no intentions of doing it. 

In the beginning it was a bit of a ego dropper even though I‚Äôm a attractive person but after talking about it, it gotten better. 

I‚Äôm curious if anyone else has experienced or done this? And if so how does it effect your relationship? Or have any advice. Any help is much appreciated!",2019-07-08 18:12:14,0,1,relationship_advice

I have fallen in love with my childhood best friend, it's been a year since we confessed this to each other, but we don't have a future together, I love him a lot. We are just flowing with the time, there's no relationship between us, we want to have sex but sometimes I get confused, should I do it or not, because I have never done this before and I really want to do it with him. I am also confused if he loves me or it's just lust . What shall I do? Is it a big deal to have sex? What if I regret after doing this?

2,caomsk,emstyler,I (30M) think I made a humongous mistake breaking up with GF (27F) of 3 1/2 months,"I think I could use some help with clarity here. She is Asian and pretty conservative in her ways/culture. I am caucasian and somewhat privileged but disabled and use a wheelchair. So anyone that dates me makes concessions because of that.

She is very introverted and essentially has only family as friends. She has a dog and 2 cats. She felt pressured to talk around my friends so usually said nothing at all. This was after I brought up how uncomfortable I was with her around my friends. 

Other things that bothered me: I would not be able to find a place to live without buying a house because of my own needs and her having 3 pets. Me getting my own dog this summer as well. 4 pets.

She liked to get top quality stuff when I was buying, and if she ever bought it was always thrift/cheap stuff. That bothered me, but she was also the one driving an hour to see me so I knew I would be paying for meals etc to feel okay with her always traveling. 

She was a very picky eater. Things I made she would sometimes try but typically not eat. I tried all of her foods because I am not fussy that way, but I wanted to share my things too. I got remarks of my taste anytime I ate onions or whatever else. She also only drank water. I drink socially and my friends typically meet at bars for a couple 2-3 drinks on weekends. She did not like that scene. I have had troubles with alcohol in my past but am now responsible with it and use it rarely, but when I do I want to be able to enjoy myself (not sloppy or causing problems). 

We were great one-on-one. With my friends, I felt uncomfortable or would leave early to come back to my apartment with her. She wants to work on that but I know how many years that process is going to take. She was supportive of me and not clingy. We had similar senses of humor and shared a love for dogs (her all pets). She trusted me and I trusted her.

I worry I was not doing my part to make the relationship work and jumped ship way too early. 

I broke up and feel miserable about it. She said she had a feeling I would break her heart when we first met and a few months later that's what ended up happening. When I was with my friends I felt relieved. When I get alone I feel terrible. Since HS, I have always broken up with or was left by people after 3-4 months. Can anyone relate to me and help me figure out if I should try to apologize and come back or to move on?",2019-07-08 18:11:59,0,1,relationship_advice

4,caomf8,ilovesocksalot,Wife was raped while cheating,"I found out about three ago that my wife cheated on me when we were dating in a long distance relationship. When I found out we were already married a few months but, had I known when we were dating I would have broken up with her on the spot. I'm not religious or anything but, cheating would be as close to a ""sin"" as I could think. It had always been one of my core beliefs that it was wrong in any circumstance. However, marriage is for life and you don't go into marriage with the option to divorce if shit doesn't work out.

I actually found out when she was inpatient on a psych ward for PTSD following a sexual trauma . The guy that raped her was the guy she cheated on me with. I didn't get a chance to really ""address"" the cheating because I was being a supportive husband about the sexual trauma. I don't know how long the relationship was or how many times they had sex or if they were dating at the same time we were. And now I'm frustrated that I don't have these answers to these questions and other questions.

Now we married, have a kid together and have a GREAT life. However, things like songs about cheating or tv shows and movies about cheating make me feel uncomfortable especially if she is there. This all came up because I mentioned something about her history of cheating when some guy from HS messaged her on FB messenger (self disclosed by her because I'm on contract in another country for 6 months) and so she deleted all of her social media to demonstrate her commitment.

I'm torn and confused. One, because I have worked with sexual assault victims as a victims advocate and I know that there was ABSOLUTELY NO situation where it was right for her to go through what she did. Two, I remember when she told me about some random guy (rapist) hitting on her. After she told me about the interaction I told her to block him because she gave him her social media info because she thought ""he just wanted to be friends. I honestly feel that she thought that was true. I knew from the jump he was trying to get with her. Three, the fact that the time window might have called into question whether my son was mine (he is).

I work in healthcare with a background in mental health so for me I have just been combatting these thoughts with focusing on what I have now and how great it is (which it truly is; we are going to have a great life. But the issue lies in the fact that about a year ago I brought it up, she cried, I felt bad, and so I said I was over it when I wasn't.√Ç 

Now she says I need to just get over or talk to someone because she doesn‚Äôt want to talk about it and keep bringing up the past. She doesn't want to talk about it because she feels like I'm going to attack her verbally and put her on trial (which I kinda want to about the cheating). But for her I don't think she wants to re-live the ""relationship‚Äùbecause it might mean answering question about the cheating but it also means reliving the trauma (which she wrote out a detailed description about the rape so I know about it).

I suggested marriage counseling but, she doesn't want anyone to know. hence the throw away account. I don't feel like ""I got closure"" (which makes me sound like a dick). What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: Wife cheated, while we were dating, and was raped by that guy. Im upset and want to address the cheating but she doesn‚Äôt want talk about anything regarding this in the past.",2019-07-08 18:11:13,1,1,relationship_advice
5,caom8i,indigoviolet123,How do I (21F) stop my brothers from destroying their relationship with our eldest brother (30M)?,"Backstory:

This weekend, my brother, Mike (25M) is getting married. His fianc√©e, Karen (32F) is a real piece of work.

She spends all of his hard-earned money on expensive designer shoes and handbags, and he works full-time to support her 'writing career'.

As her bridesmaid, I have received a lot of her abuse. Last week, she told me that my boobs were too small and I would need to stuff my bra at the wedding otherwise it would ruin her photos.

My brothers, Jake (24M) and Lewis (22M) hate this union just as much as I do. We've all spoken to Mike about this on several occasions, but he's intent on marrying her.

She's controlling, manipulative and is turning him against the whole family.

She even lied that Jake tried to kiss her?

Jake and Lewis have decided to stand up at the wedding ceremony and announce that they don't approve of this union. They tried to recruit me to join in. But I just don't think that it's going to happen. I've tried to discourage them, but they feel that they need to stop him from making the biggest mistake of his life. If Jake and Lewis humiliate her at the ceremony, he will NEVER forgive them.

Please help - My old family is a complete chaos

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 10 years old my mom got pregnant by her tennis coach and she decided to divorce from my

dad and to move to my grandparents who lived about 200 km away from my dad.

&amp;#x200B;

I must say that i dont like what my mother did. But my dad was the worst dad ever. only working, agressive, mean to us.... somehow i could understand my mother.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to say that I am 37 now, married, with 2 wonderful kids.

&amp;#x200B;

But my past still makes me really sad sometimes. Because no one of my family has a contact with me, not my brother who is 5 years older than me and got my dads company, which is completey okay for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, after my mom, me and my new-born sister moved away my mother needed to fight several years until my ""father"" paid alimentation for us, which was really little money for him, becuase in general he is a rich person. He just did not want to pay for us, because all he wanted to do, was to punish us that way.

&amp;#x200B;

Even the police had to come to our grand parents house one day because he was screaming around and wanted my mother to come out of the house. I remember all those things really good, although they are almost 25 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless my mother started to drink alcohol after her ""tennis"" coach left her and went back to the united states. all I had to do was to take care of my little sister which was the most innocent person in this world.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother was several times unconscious from drinking, so i had to call my grandparents who were helping us quickly. Because of those things, being poor, drinking mother, dad who needed to be picked up by police i needed to fight in school for about 4-5 years.  nearly every day i had fights with my class mates. And because all of this I was thinking of a suicide when i was 14-15 years old, but i didnt because then my little sister would be all one.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, i want to make it short: All the things became better when my mom got some money from my father and we could buy a house. I could study a complete different subject, my dad was against it all my life, but now i have such a good job that I earn enough money to feed my kids on my own.

&amp;#x200B;

I never got any extra money from my dad.

&amp;#x200B;

But now there comes the big but.

&amp;#x200B;

3 years ago when my first kid was born I wanted to invite my dad, my mom, my older brother, my little sister to a family therapist, because our family is broken into a thousand pieces.

&amp;#x200B;

The truth is that only my father came. My brother who got alot of money by my dad and a company, wrote my a letter where he is saying that i should ""start building something on my own finally""

&amp;#x200B;

This really made me laugh and I wrote him back ""What did you build on your own actually?""

&amp;#x200B;

Then I got a letter from his lawyer, who was writing ... if I ever will get in contact with him again he will sue me. I wrote his lawyer back and asked him, that they would sue me because of what? Just go ahead with it .... I never got a reply....

&amp;#x200B;

My mother broke the contact with me after she got to hear that i was planning to talk with her at a family therapist ..... i need to say that she was not talking since about 25 years to my brother as well. So i tried to fix this also.

&amp;#x200B;

The therapist told me that my mom probably just took me after the divorce because she wanted to keep the money which was actually mine.

&amp;#x200B;

And now the best part ... even my little sister broke the contact with me and I tried everything to get a reason from here. I didnt do anything to her, but supporting and caring.

&amp;#x200B;

can you image that? That breaks my heart most of all in this story....

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless i did all this because i got a wonderful wife now and 2 lovely kids and I wanted to share this with my family, but it is just not possible.

&amp;#x200B;

The lucky thing is that my wife has a wonderful familiy, but i just cannot forget this.

&amp;#x200B;

That is why i wrote u all this stuff to get your opinion about this.

&amp;#x200B;

All I can say is that the family therapist was shocked about the things in my family.

&amp;#x200B;

And guess what. the only guy who was coming to the therapist was my dad ... and here the therapist send my home after she heard what my dad did to all of us.

&amp;#x200B;

after my dad had 3 or 4 sessions with the therapist he was writing me a letter that he is so sorry for all what he did... i showed this letter to my wife and told her ... lets wait for some weeks and he will change again ....

&amp;#x200B;

and exactly that happened. he started writing me again, that this is all my fault and i deserved the life that I had. And he keeps on asking me what we did with the [alimony](https://de.pons.com/%C3%BCbersetzung/englisch-deutsch/alimony) he had to pay for me. ""You must have a life like a god in france"" he is saying ... :-S

&amp;#x200B;

it was actually the 2nd therapist we had, and both were saying that is it not the fault of me what happened to my family.

&amp;#x200B;

i could write so much more but i think it should be enough for the first part ....

&amp;#x200B;

hope to get some of your opinions and ideas how i can go on with this.",2019-07-08 18:09:25,0,2,relationship_advice

10,caol6g,littlelunaa12,"I (f,19) was set to be married to my (m,23) army ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù next month. He broke up with me randomly, without much explanation, and now has a new girlfriend where he is stationed.","My ex (m,23) and I (f,19) had been dating for almost three years. He joined the army in September of last year, we had discussed getting married on multiple occasions, and decided that after all of his training was done, we‚Äôd get married so I could live with him where he‚Äôs stationed (ended up being a 7hr drive from home about three states over, northern east coast). We wanted to make sure we were both ready for the military life and whatnot, which is why we had a waiting period. We were going to get court married in May when he came to visit, we had everything prepared for it, until my mom  said she wanted to help us have a small little family wedding in August. He was all for it and excited. So I planned it all out. My mom even gave him her old wedding rings (my parents are divorced) to get resized bc we didn‚Äôt really have the money to buy rings ourself. He never formally asked me to marry him due to that, but we planned on having a formal wedding and engagement after the fact when we did have the money, we just didn‚Äôt want to be apart anymore.  I ‚Äúdropped out‚Äù of the college I was attending to transfer to one near base and began packing all of my stuff for moving with him (which would be up to a month after the wedding). 
About a month ago we started struggling and he became more distant saying he‚Äôs ‚Äúlost without me there‚Äù and just ‚Äúwishes I was already here‚Äù 
About three weeks ago he told me he didn‚Äôt think we should be together anymore and that he doesn‚Äôt think we can fix us unless he fixes himself. 
About a week later, he‚Äôs dating a girl who lives in his area (who I believe is around his age). 

Our relationship struggled a lot because of his personal issues. He always believed I was cheating on him, though I never did. No matter what I said he always felt like I could do better. He feared commitment a lot because his mother left him with his aunt when he was young, then his aunt left him behind, and another girl he was engaged to left also. He always assumed I would do the same. He‚Äôs cheated before, flirting with other girls and whatnot. It seemed like every six months or so he‚Äôd break up w me for something stupid and we‚Äôd work it out (communication was really hard for him even more so when he joined the army). We always worked things out. 
I don‚Äôt know anything about his new girlfriend, and I‚Äôm not the type to try to break them up or flirt or anything like that, even though we had just broken up. He was acting like he normally does till like a day or two before he asked the girl out. I truly hope he‚Äôs happy. 
We‚Äôre still friends and talk occasionally. I still love him dearly (though I know I shouldn‚Äôt).

I also think there‚Äôs many other things we can do to prevent pregnancy without compromising our sex life. he doesn‚Äôt seem to want to take any of these precautions, just jumps straight to no sex. 

during our pregnancy scare I told him that I was nervous that I was pregnant but that i‚Äôd be happy and try to make the best out of our situation. he also said that he‚Äôd immediately marry and we‚Äôd move in together if i was pregnant. well, finally I got my period and he used everything I said about being happy and trying to do my best against me. he said to me that us having a baby, getting married, and moving in together was everything that I want and that he was mad at me for being happy about it. I should also add I told him that I was worried that I was infertile and that being pregnant would prove that i‚Äôm not. it‚Äôs a really big insecurity of mine and every time I told him I felt like he didn‚Äôt care. when I told him all he said was that it would suck if I was and he‚Äôd hate to be infertile. 

we love each other a lot and have exchanged rings (something to look at and think of each other because he is currently in another country). his accusations really hurt me because I would never do something to potentially ruin his future plans.

I believe he suffers from schizophrenia but he isn't ready to accept that diagnosis. He has finally stopped using weed, which has helped him tenfold. He is going to therapy weekly and really working on himself, and I am so proud of him for it. I struggle with chronic pain and its hard overall to get out of the depression funk of that.  We've been through so much: hospitalizations (his), operations (mine), diet restrictions (mine), and so much more.I acknowledged I probably have been so focused on him and my chronic pain that I haven't been taking care of myself in the right way. I've gained weight, I've been really depressed and anxious.

I felt things were starting to be off for the past two weeks. In the past, when things have been off, it's usually a sign he wants to break up. He has said so many things about wanting to break up before. In a way, I always felt it was about him being worried that he will hit rock bottom and didn't want me there, or that he felt I was too good for him and I deserve to be happy with someone else. About 6 months ago, he said he wanted to break up because he found someone at work attractive and wanted to talk to her and see if something was there. I felt things were over then, I was devastated and we talked and talked that weekend and said we would work it out and on monday the more I thought about it, I was ready to end the relationship that day.

I wanted to be his priority like he is mine. I wanted him to get better and be healthy and not be having episodes.

Since then, things have been really good. He had stopped using, he was less irritable, my pain was less frequent. He talked more about our future and living together, having kids. I don't know if Ill be able to but we both want kids, we have talked about adopting too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday when I asked if something was going on, I wasn't sure if it was my anxiety getting the best of me or not. He said he needs to figure out things. He started talking to that girl and that she's really similar to me but he is attracted to her physically. He said Im perfect in every way except physically with the weight Ive put on. He said he wants me in his life always, but I don't know if I can be just his friend.

&amp;#x200B;

So far we are still together and going to see each other tonight. I don't know if this is the end of us.... I really don't want it to be. I love him so much, really I do. I want to support him in everything, I want a future with him, I don't want anyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do... I know I've stopped taking care of myself and that's wrong and I have to do that and I will. Am I supposed to wait till he figures things out? Am I just being delusional thinking he will pick me? And I know it's wrong of me to even think this but I just want to be enough for him.

16,caohoj,lavender-vanilla,My [23F] boyfriend [21M] of two years wants me to move to a different state with him so he can go to college,"First post, sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. It will be long, my apologies.

To preface this, I have lived on my own and been financially independent for about 4 years and I moved to a new state a few months ago to be closer to my job and am renting a house with one other person for a great price. My job offers excellent benefits, bonuses, and vacation time. It's a stressful job and the pay isn't amazing but for a first ""grown-up job"" out of college, I'm not doing bad at all. Unfortunately, my moving has put a strain on my relationship as now I am about an hour from where my bf lives with his parents and he only sees me once every week or two. Before that, he would come to see me at my apartment every day and stay over most nights. It became an issue to my roommates because he did not help financially at all but that is a different story (still important to mention).

When we met I was in college and my bf was considering going to a college 5-7 hours away and we never really talked about it because we had just started dating and I didn't feel as though I had any input. Our relationship was only a couple months old at that point. I understood we wouldn't be a thing if he went away and would have been fine if he decided to move away as I was not invested yet. He made the decision to work instead of going to college which was fine, and I never once asked him to stay for me.

Moving forward two years, my boyfriend has decided it is time to go to this school and asked me to move with him. Until this point, he has been working in retail and has had little drive to look for a job that he enjoys or pays him more. He has been intermittently unemployed or working part-time and rarely has any money saved. I've been putting pressure on him to go to school or find a job willing to pay him more or give him more hours because he is not able to support himself even though he still lives with his parents. 

The problem lies in that he would likely be moving at the end of August to a dorm. In this situation, I would have to quit my job and find a new one, find housing and probably a new roommate, and make new friends. Personally, I feel it is unfair of him to ask me to move with him if we are not even moving in together. I would lose everything and he wouldn't have to give up anything. I would have to uproot my life for him to be in college for 2-4 years just to move again when he graduates. And financially he would not be responsible or helpful if I could not find a job or affordable housing. If I failed to secure a job and housing I would be unable to turn to him for help. He would be all set with his dorm and a goal to work towards. And it would probably be very convenient for him to stay at my place off campus if he wanted. 

He thinks it should be easy for me as I have moved many times(except every time I have had a job and/or housing already lined up), I have not made any strong new connections since moving to my new state (but all my old friends are about 1-2 hours away and we take turns seeing each other), and since he would do the same for me. If I had asked him to move for me I would already at least have housing for both of us. It does not seem fair for him to ask me to move with no guarantee of any stability and to abandon what I already have. 

So essentially I am asking if I am wrong here if I tell him no? Am I being unreasonable or is he making an unreasonable request of me?

18,caog89,Pantriar,Best friend hasn‚Äôt been making efforts to hang out for over a year.,"My [M 23] best friend [F 28] has made little effort in making plans or hanging out. For some background, her and I used to live 5 minutes from each other and would hang out at least 2-3 times/week some 3+ years ago until I moved away for college and a job. She‚Äôs now lived about 25 minutes away from me for around 2 years with her now-husband (him and I get along great, just for the record). I visited them near when they first moved in and again when they had me and my ex over for dinner about 6 months later. However, since then her and I have not seen each other once. I‚Äôll occasionally get a text from her saying something like ‚ÄúI told ‚ÄòX‚Äô friend that we all need to hang out soon‚Äù or I‚Äôll reach out every month or so wanting to make plans, but they never lead anywhere because she never offers times she‚Äôs free.

I want to talk to her about it, but am having trouble figuring out the logistics of how to say it. Another important note to add, she‚Äôs about 8 months pregnant. And while obviously that has consumed a large portion of her time, it‚Äôs still been well over a year since we‚Äôve hung out, but I could easily see using the pregnancy as an excuse why she hasn‚Äôt been able to do anything.  And I know once she has her child, any free time she would have is out the window. 

What‚Äôs the best way to go about discussing this? Or should I even say anything?

20,caofgl,dukes1998,I (20M) am worried I may be getting ‚Äútoo into‚Äù my relationship with my girlfriend (19F).,"So me and my girlfriend have been officially dating (we go to the same school) for about 3 months, and have been hooking up since January. Before that we had been talking since like October. 

Our relationship is frankly pretty amazing. She‚Äôs really everything I look for in an LTR, and definitely someone I can see myself with for a long time. We‚Äôre each other‚Äôs first relationship, although we‚Äôve both hooked up with other people before this (I did pseudo date a girl who ended up being a BPD nutcase who moved very, very fast so it has me nervous).

But in the back of my mind, part of me is worries I‚Äôm too invested. We‚Äôve met each other‚Äôs parents quite a few times, we‚Äôve met all of each others friends and her friends love me and always want me to hang with them. We talk essentially all day, and we see each other multiple times a week as we only live like 45 minutes away. At school we lived with each other the last few months before summer break and we will almost certainly be essentially living with one another again when school starts in the fall. 

I‚Äôm very very in love with her, and can really see myself with her for a long time, and I know she feels the same way. But at this point I feel like a breakup would really fuck me up emotionally. I worry I‚Äôm too dependent, and at only 20, the prospect of future marriage scares me a bit, and she‚Äôs hinted at wanting that a lot. We both struggle with depression, and while my mental health is pretty good right now and it isn‚Äôt super severe I feel as if a breakup would impact me harder than most. 

Should I let myself enjoy this relationship as much as I can and take it one day at a time, or take a bit of a step back so an eventual breakup wouldn‚Äôt hit me so hard?

TL;DR: My girlfriend and I are very young but super in love, I worry about being too far into it and being fucked up emotionally in the event of a breakup.",2019-07-08 17:57:37,0,1,relationship_advice

22,caof5w,MoonlightXX88,Is this a ghosting or just being immature?,"First I apologise in advance for any grammatical errors as English is my 2nd language.

My(30F) boyfriend (31M) was being a coward.
It was my birthday and we were planning to celebrate it together after his shift. 
During the day i called him to confirm if we are going out later? But he said ""Not really"". (He sounds like not interested) I was shocked and disappointed,so I just said ""Fine and thank you"". (I kept on wondering what was happening)

Suddenly, One of our friend asked him personally what will be the plan because its my birthday. Unfortunately, he replied with "" Hi bro, we actually JUST BROKE UP."" ( I feel so numb)so, out of anger i sent him a message of "" He is a horrible person! He could just say some alibi, why he did not tell me? Why to our friend?"" But i did not get a reply after all.

I just think he didn't even care enough about me to end it properly. Maybe he got fed up of me. So he decided to just tell to someone was the best way to do it.

He blocked me to all social medias except in WhatsApp. 
Am I pathetic to seek for a formal break up?  I deserve to know the issue right? Or shall i just forget about it?",2019-07-08 17:57:01,4,2,relationship_advice
23,caoeic,Abrakedebrah,Trying new things with gf,"We‚Äôre coming up on 3 years and the sex is starting to feel awkward.  Sex used to be spontaneous and fun.  She used to have strong organism from PIV alone.  I‚Äôm the first guy she‚Äôs squirted from.  Now even with 10 minutes of finger foreplay and PIV with a vibrator on her clit it seems to take for ever.  At first I wanted to blame it on the vibrator but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the actual problem.  I think the urge for her to have sex with me is gone.  Now sex with her is like playing bop it.  It‚Äôs like she has no anticipation of what pleasure is happing and is just laying there waiting to feel something as I try all sorts of foreplay on her.  I think she doesn‚Äôt see me as she used to.  Instead of masculine and mysterious she now sees me as timid and familiar.

I have asked her to try to new things to change up the mood but she has been super reluctant.  Even if she did participate I think she might just drag her feet and complain the whole time.  I‚Äôve asked her if we could do a rape role play where I hold a fake gun to her head during sex.  She said no.  I‚Äôve asked her if we could have sex in a public place.  She said no.

24,caoed9,throwaway1306__,Guy [25M] I'm [22F] seeing has a girl [28F] in another country that he's known longer than he's known me that he has feelings for cares about alot but they're not together. Am I crazy for sticking around?,"I (22f) started seeing this guy (25m) around September/August of last year after I broke up with my long term (4.5 years) boyfriend that I had been dating since highschool.

We initially entered a friends with benefits agreement and it worked wonders for a while. We were at that stage both finishing off our final year at a small private college, both majoring in the same subject thus having alot of class time together during the day and after class we'd spend an hour or two having great sex and then he'd return to his house or I would return to mine to work/study as we were entering final exams at that time.

When we started hooking up I had known him for 2.5+ years and we had been good friends for the last year of that. I definitely knew I was attracted to him when I was still with my ex, and even though some playful flirting happened on occasion neither of us ever acted on it until one night when we got drunk together and I tried to kiss him. He stopped me and told me even though he wants to, he can't because I had a boyfriend. At this stage I was already very unhappy in my relationship and had been thinking of ending it for months. Even though I felt awful for almost cheating, it gave me the courage to finally end things with my bf.

Anyway thereafter me and this guy started hooking up and we've been together ever since. Somewhere around end of November and beginning of December things had become more serious between us and after we attended graduation we had two weeks holiday before he had to return to his family in a different part of the country.

We went on holiday together and for the first time started acting like a couple in public and such. We'd been keeping our agreement very hush hush in the town where we studied as it's small and word gets around quick and I didn't want my ex finding out because he knew the guy and we/I didn't wait very long before we started hooking up and out of respect for my ex as well as just keeping the peace we both decided it would be better to keep us a secret.

Anyway the holidays were upon us and we traveled together, continued to have amazing sex and spent every second for 2 weeks together. We met each other's parents at graduation and we spent my birthday together. I was officially starting to fall for him.

I've never met anyone like him before, were complete opposites yet we never run out of things to talk about, having studied the same degree we also have many common interests. He's different to any guy I've ever dated before and I'm absolutely crazy about him. He's hard to get to know, stubborn and anal as hell. A typical ESTJ personality. Ambitious, intelligent and knee-buckling attractive to boot. Everything about him makes me just want to marry him and have beautiful like minded babies. He's perfect to me and I can absolutely see a future with him.

Here's the massive BUT in this story.  Somewhere along the lines after he graduated high school he went working/traveling around the world and met a girl (f28). So she lives on the other side of the world and doesn't speak of her much but I've known about her since day one. They've known each other for roughly 6 years and keep in touch, everyday. They've been together romantically and I can tell he really likes her. He's been to her to visit her and she's come to visit him.

Okay so when 2019 begun I was looking for my first job straight out of college. He was too. We ended up spending 3 months apart at our respective parents' homes and because he lived far away we only saw each other twice. Both times for a few days where we planned great adventures and spent weekends in cozy Airbnbs having good sex and bonding/cuddling and acting like a couple.

A big part of understanding our relationship is understanding him, he is very ridgid and doesn't communicate well. Thik Sheldon Cooper vibes. He doesn't talk about his feelings, doesn't show public affection and has never had a typical boyfriend/girlfriend relationship.
I'm a hopeless romantic, INFP personality, that basically speaks feelings every time I open my mouth. He upsets me easily without noticing it but it's helped me not be so soft or overreact/take something too personally.

Something great happend, we both landed a job in the same city around mid March and moved closer to each other. I live by myself where he lives in a house with 3 other guys. When we rekindled after that month being apart, we agreed we're not seeing other people.

Anyway our relationship progressed and we are in every sense a couple, without the massive label. I know his friends, he knows mine and we occasionally hug and kiss in public.

Something else to note, he's not a romantic and gets lost in his work and the things he must get done so easily. He can be a bit selfish sometimes and is very serious about how he spends his time and he hates being lazy/unproductive. One week a few months ago in the start of April I believe. We were having a bad week where I felt very insecure and I felt like he didn't care.

(Also another thing to note, I've mentioned he isn't a romantic and he doesn't spoil me/buy me things at all, something I was very used to in my previous relationship)

Okay so we were having a bad week and I was lonely and looking for attention and I gave into a guy who's been asking me out for months and agreed to let him take me out for dinner. He's a real gentleman and is a bit older than me and spoilt me so much by taking me out to a fancy restaurant and making me feel super special.

I lied to the guy I was seeing and said I was going to girls night. He had a feeling about it and when I got home came over and interrogated me until I gave in and admitted I went on a date. He was enraged and very hurt by my actions and asked me what about our agreement to not see other people and then in a bout of drunkness from dinner and to try and justify my actions I asked about her for the first time (note, he's never mentioned her to me before, I only knew about her from his/mutual friends). Ok so I asked him about his intentions and asked him if she had flew to him to visit him over the long holidays (because I had a feeling) and he confirmed it. He didn't really say much and kind of shut me down as if I wasn't allowed to talk about her. He just said that I shouldn't worry as he is more of a friend to her than everything else and that she's going though a tough time (loss of a grandparent). Even though it's not fun to hear I couldn't be mad as were were not together at the time she visited him and I had hooked up with other guys over my holiday too and at that stage I was feeling terrible for going out with another guy.

He was mad at me for about 2 weeks before things started to get better again. We picked up where we left off and I didn't ask about her again. Every now and then I'd see her name pop up on his phone and he calles her every Sunday evening which annoyes me but I can't tell him he's not allowed to so I accepted it and moved on.

I haven't been pressuring him for a more facebook-official relationship because I respect how he feels about being in other people's faces and tbh it's not something I needed, I was happy and things were good. 

Anyway moving on, the last couple of months have passed and we've continued to be together and happy with the occasional argument but nothing serious and no talking about her.

So this weekend we're out shopping and we're in a shop and he buys a female leather belt and tells me it's for his cousin. So I nod, immediately having a strong feeling that he's lying). On the walk to his car I ask him about his cousin ans when her bday is, he says that it's not her bday and just a gift. I stop asking questions and we continue our day and meet up with friends. By the middle of the day I had put two and two together and had a pretty strong feeling he bought it for her. Which felt very shitty as he's never really bought me gift or anything (I'm not superficial it's just the concept of a gift, not necessarily something with monatary value). So later that night I find a time and build up the courage to ask him if the belt is really for his cousin. He first tries to lie but then comes clean, I ask him who's it for and he responds 'you know who it's for' and then brings up the guy I went on a date with months back as a way to justify what he did. So I ask him if in his mind we're ok in a relationship as in boyfriend and girlfriend to which he responds 'no, I will not have a girlfriend until I decide I want to get married'. After that I started to cry and he suddenly become very affectionate saying sorry that he bought her a gift and made me feel shit and insecure all day and that he fucked up. That happened on Saturday.

Yesterday he's back to his old self and even gives her a call while I'm over at his house (he always makes the call in another room behind closed doors, I can never hear a thing). But furthermore we're fine and we go out for dinner and have a good night. 

So heres the thing. I'm crazy about this guy. Fuck I might even love him. I'm a very empathetic person and I can understand how she's been his first love and they've stayed in touch all this time and he probably cares about her so much. The thing is she's on the other side of the world and he's not interested in getting married anytime soon. He's not by definition in a relationship and that's probably how he makes this work in his mind. He's a kind person with good morals and that's one good reason I'm still around because I know that he wouldn't be with me still if he didn't feel something for me. He's not the type of guy to just keep me around for his pleasure, our relationship goes way further than that. So I know on some level if he didn't care about me he would have ended our relationship long ago, but were still together and we get along so well.

So what's bothering me is how to deal with this girl.. I can't ask him to stop taking to her but it hurts me. I sometimes feel he gives her all his emotional support and that leaves little to me who sometimes really needs it.

Personally I'm trying to balance my first job and the fatigue that comes with it and dealing with some financial and family issues and I don't feel like I can easily speak to him about these things (he's from a very priveliged family who seems oh so perfect and I feel like he won't be able to relate/or he will look down on me).

There's one more thing that's been bothering me.. if he's buying her gifts he's probably seeing her soon. He's mentioned a family trip coming up in the next 2 months and I have a feeling she might be joining. I want to ask him about it tonight.. I can deal with it, I just want him to be honest with me. I don't want to make him choose. But I don't want him lying to me. Even if he sees her and they have sex and they're together for a week I can wrap my head around it because I care about him.

I was thinking about suggesting that if she's joining on his family trip, that it's okay and I just don't want to know about what they did. And in return I will also be taking a week seeing other people if I wanted to so I can at least distract myself from them being together and when he comes back we can slowly pick it up again. Is that crazy? I just care about him and I can't imagine how hard it must be to genuinely care about two people at the same time and wanting them both in your life.

I'm not really open to open relationships and it's a shitty feeling but I don't want to lose him. I don't know what I've gotten myself into.. but I'm invested and I refuse to give up.

Other things to note:

-I'm the first person he's ever gotten this close with besides her. It's always just been him and her thousands of miles away.

-She knows about me and occasionally watches my insta stories. (Guy I'm seeing has asked me to put my account on private a few months ago).

-Her ig is private.

-By my expert googling and as much as it probably doesn't do me any well knowing, this is what I know about her:

-I know where she lives.
-She is 3 years older than he is. (f28)

Please help r/relationships. I'm tired of thinking about this.

TL;DR
The guy I'm seeing has a girl he cares about overseas and I'm not sure what to do about it.

25,caod1d,drawforKeysT_T,My [25/F]friend is having her bday party at my[25/F]place but I never agreed.. but I'm too scared to say no.,"I am the only one in my group of friends who has their own house and lives within the city so I'm no stranger to hosting events and parties at my place. Usually, I host once a month but lately I've needed a break since hosting is a lot of work and money and I'm just generally exhausted. Some of my friends don't hold their liquor well and I just find myself constantly stressed and unable to enjoy my own parties. I get it though, I'm the host and I've made it my responsibility to make sure everyone and my place is ok.

HOWEVER, my friend's birthday is coming up and she's essentially implied that we're gonna have her bday party at my place. She planned the dinner a close walk to my place (her place is about an hour away), and then said that we can drink + play games afterwards (games that we can only play..at my place..). I was just at a loss for words (I felt kind of offended? LOL is that weird idk..) and really didn't know how to be like ""wait hold up I didn't agree to this"". I just don't know how to word it without upsetting her - with any other friend I feel like I can be upfront and tell them hold up I didn't agree to this but with her it's different. It doesn't help that I'm getting ready to move next month and money is tight and I was honestly just fine eating out - if I'm hosting I need to buy snacks + extra drinks + etc. 

She's told me before she's never had close girlfriends, she doesn't get along with girls because there's always drama surrounding them, and that she's really happy we have this ""sisterhood"". A part of me is scared if I tell her no she's just going to think I'm just another girl that's chasing drama with her. It doesn't help that I set her up with a mutual friend and I know they're in their honeymoon phase and I'd love for them to just have fun together without any parents or what not around but I'm just really mentally exhausted from hosting. :( 

So how do I tell her no without her feeling like I'm just ""one of those girls who's ready to backstab/chasing drama?"" :/",2019-07-08 17:52:29,3,1,relationship_advice
26,caocq9,DrDrakeRamorayEel,I have a creepy step granddad and I don't know what to do.,"Ok first thing, I was molested by a neighbor when I was 5. He got caught, he was put away. Blah blah blah. I've been in therapy for years. Grandad has nothing to do with that but I feel I have to mention it.

Anyway, my Grandma married a guy when I was a kid, probably about 7 or 8. He was not a nice man. Terse, stern, and pretty much insisted we stay outside when we came to visit. We barely talked because he's quiet and he doesn't like kids.

One time, he took me to a gas station alone in his truck without telling my parents or Grandma. It was a quick errand, he picked up some ice and got me an ice cream. When we got back my mom FREAKED and it scared me a little. 

Later Gma and him divorced, I don't know why. They have 2 grown children that are my dad's half sister and half brother. One of them got married and I was freshly out of college. At her wedding  stepgrandad kept insisting on dancing with me and would get too close and whisper things in my ear, like how nice I looked and how I grew up to be a beautiful woman. These things are innocent enough right?

Then every time he sees me in public he goes for a hug but it's like, I don't know you. I just feel really uncomfortable and I'm wondering if I tell anyone about it, tell him, confront him, if he's even doing anything wrong...I just don't know. Now I see him at Christmas and I just try to avoid him but it's a small room. My parents aren't around anymore and I want to maintain the relationship I have with my Grandma and their daughter, I don't want to ruin anything. Am I overreacting? Should I just suck it up and not say anything? Or be straight with him that he's making me uncomfortable?

I really want to be able to help them out throughout their tough times and be there for them when they need someone the most. I‚Äôm not the best at helping, but I‚Äôd try my absolute best because I don‚Äôt like seeing my friends in any kind of pain. 

Also, I‚Äôm worried that because I for some reason don‚Äôt know how to tell them I care for them, that if they pass or if I pass, I won‚Äôt be able to tell them or let them know. I get really paranoid for no reason about people dying and it sucks. 

I told a group of online friends about this (at least ten of them in there) and only two responded. The two said I was great and whatever and I actually managed to tell them I loved then because I really do. They‚Äôre great people. 

It just sucks. I‚Äôm definitely repeating myself but my friends mean a lot to me. I want to be closer to them and be able to express my gratitude for them. Tbh they haven‚Äôt even really done anything for me but I just want to help them out because I like helping people. 

Anyways, that‚Äôs it lmao",2019-07-08 17:51:44,6,0,relationship_advice
28,caochr,ninjamos,Wondering if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend,"I‚Äôm soon to be 21 in a few days (F) and my boyfriend is soon to be 20 (M). We recently got into a big fight last night because I‚Äôm tired of the way he is. Sometimes I feel like we are more friends than boyfriend and girlfriend and he doesn‚Äôt agree. We don‚Äôt really do anything sexual it‚Äôs only me doing the work ever when we actually do. I want to feel more loved but I guess he‚Äôs just not like that. 

I struggle with anxiety and depression and I‚Äôve had a lot of things going on lately and he‚Äôs telling me to deal with it and basically everything could be a lot worse. I get that but i hate sitting there crying and him just sitting there looking at me. Not comforting me at all. He just doesn‚Äôt seem so much like a bf but I feel like if I break up with him other guys won‚Äôt be much better. Me and him are each others first relationship. We are now almost together for 2 years and during the first few months I feel like he was a little more loving. I feel like if I breakup with him I‚Äôll have nobody. No friends and won‚Äôt be able to find anyone else. And I do love him and I know he does love me. I guess he just doesn‚Äôt show it. I tried breaking up with him before and he bawled his eyes out saying how he doesn‚Äôt want anyone else and he just wants to be with me. It‚Äôs very frustrating. When we hang out he just wants to work on his cars or do things I don‚Äôt do and I just sit there all day and watch. He just doesn‚Äôt do relationship type things and that‚Äôs why I feel like we are friends. 

His mom also does everything for him so I hate when he tells me to get over things and just deal with them. His mom pays his car, his phone, cuts his chicken and makes him sandwiches for work... buys him everything.. where growing up for me my family is poor and my mom doesn‚Äôt do anything for me as in I bought my own car, pay my own phone, and own insurance and he still wants me to pay for food when we go out or complain about gas meanwhile he comes from money. I think sometimes how we were both brought up is also a big clashing factor. 

What would you do in this situation? It‚Äôs tough. I‚Äôm lost. I just don‚Äôt want to spend another two years feeling unloved.",2019-07-08 17:51:20,0,1,relationship_advice

31,caoc1r,throwitalldown456,I (34F) worry about being too needy/ clingy in a 1-year relationship with my boyfriend (34M) but he hasn't shown any indication of that being the case,"In a very long-term relationship, I was always with my ex. We moved in together in the last 2 years of our relationship, when it all kind of went to shit. The breakup was very difficult for me and it took a few years to get over. I am pretty much over it now, but I kept thinking back to what I could have done better.

I've been actively dating for the past few years. I was with my ex for my entire 20s so dating was all new to me then when I started around 30. It was fun for a bit and made me more social, and gave me insight into a lot of people's points of views, background, etc., so I got a lot out of it.. but I have to say I got pretty sick of it after a few years, and got a few emotional bruises and bumps along the way, and also gave a few.

I was also actively reading on how to be a better partner, and a main theme is to not be overly needy/ clingy with a guy. For context, I'm pretty sure I have an insecure attachment, and my past two relationships ended bc 1) my ex fell out of love with me, and 2) the other cheated on me.

I have been dating the current guy for a year now, and so far it's been great. I am finding myself really attached/ committed to him at this point and we've talked about the future together, and have met each others' parents, friends, relatives, etc.

I basically expect to spend the whole weekend with him, every weekend. I get a bit sulky when he makes trips without me (e.g., going back to his hometown for visits). We talk online everyday (good morning and goodnight texts and some conversation in between) and/ or have calls. I like to know his plans and what he's doing when I am not with him.

I've also been a bit more assertive with pushing things along in regards to meeting his friends/ coworkers, when I realized it wasn't going to happen if I didn't ask for it. Meanwhile, he's met all my friends.

He's been very cooperative/ willing in terms of the time spent together, but in the back of my mind I always think whether or not I'm being too pushy/ clingy/ demanding of his commitment/ attention.

I think I'm not being unreasonable but I am just afraid of being needy/ clingy.

Am I? Or am I just worrying about nothing? If I am, what should I do differently?",2019-07-08 17:50:25,2,2,relationship_advice
32,caobzr,droppedandconfused,"I [31/m] was ghosted, dumped and lied to by a girl I was dating [26/f]. What happened here?","I went out for about five weeks with a girl I was crazy about. She really seemed to like me too, we always had a nice time together and she seemed super-attracted to me, our sex life was good and didn't leave either of us (as far as I could tell) wanting for much. We also seemed to want some of the same things for our future.

Things progressed somewhat quickly - I suggested after probably four or five dates that I think I'd want a relationship at some point, but was obviously fine with waiting for a while as we hadn't known each other that long. I also made it clear to her that I wanted to make sure I wasn't trying to move things along too fast. She told me repeatedly that our pace was fine and if things DID go too fast, she'd tell me.

We didn't have many mishaps. About 7-8 dates in we went out to some bars, I saw her texting some dude (about how good they each looked) who I thought was just a friend, but I was quite drunk so I got a little quiet as I tried to process it and tell myself internally ""it's cool, it's just a friend probably."" But she could tell something was bothering me and finally dragged it out of me - I apologized for it even being an issue, but she told me later ""I'm kind of bothered by it. You were cold with me and it seems a little possessive."" I felt awful because I'm not a possessive/jealous guy and I was only trying to process what was happening because I was drunk (I wasn't even upset or trying to be cold) but I think she's *really* mad at me, so I start to tear up a bit (yeah, really attractive, I know) and babblingly explain I just felt a little insecure. She didn't stay upset long, we made up later and acknowledged it was just a misunderstanding, and I explained my mindset to her once I sobered up.

Only other thing that clearly went a little wrong was the last time we saw each other, I thought we made plans for her to stay over with me, but she said she was leaving because she misunderstood the plans. I was visibly a little disappointed, but not mad or anything. I asked if she wanted me to go to her place instead to make it easier, but she seemed a little wishy-washy. After she made it clear she needed time alone to rest and work on some stuff, I backed off and we made up, with her saying she was glad we could talk about it.

After she doesn't call when she planned to the next night to make plans for the weekend and I text her that I'm a bit concerned, she dumps me a few hours later over text, saying she's too busy/tired from job and life stresses for a relationship.

After I send her some messages asking her to talk and that I'm heartbroken and blindsided, she calls me and says a few things that don't make a whole lot of sense to me. She said that she felt that I needed more than she could give, but not that I was ""needy,"" and was stressed out by how much I wanted to see her. Also said that there were times when she felt like she ""couldn't leave"", but didn't given me any specifics (and I was floored by that, the entire time I knew her I wanted to make sure she had space and that I wasn't being clingy, and I NEVER whined at her to stay longer or let me stay over longer than we planned).

However, what confused me was that the previous week, she said she wanted to see me MORE, and we'd only been seeing each other about twice a week. We weren't exactly attached at the hip (and she lives about 20 minutes away).

She also heavily suggested a few days prior that we were getting close to being in an official relationship, saying that ""the only reason we're not official is that I really like you and don't want to mess things up by going too fast.""

Given all this, I was super-confused and told her I had no problem seeing her less often for a while if she needed more time to herself and I wasn't expecting a relationship immediately or on some specific timetable. After I told her this, she immediately changed her mind and said ""okay, let's keep going out."" There wasn't a whole lot of convincing I had to do.

Then she ghosts me for nearly two months.

I find out later that she's officially in a relationship with someone else a few days ago.

I call her out on this - I sent her some rambling messages as I was upset but I didn't call her names, swear at her, etc. Just told her I was really hurt that she'd lie to me about ""not having time for a relationship"" and it wasn't acceptable for her to just ghost me after saying she wanted to keep dating.

To my surprise, she actually replies. The response she gives is pretty weird. According to her, she'd known this guy, who I believe is one of her co-workers, for over one year but they ""reconnected two weeks ago"" and that he wasn't in the picture while she and I were going out.

She also says ""What you're doing now is exactly what drove me away,"" and blocks me.

I have absolutely no idea what that means and I know I'll probably never get an answer from her. But after sitting here for two months wondering if it was something I did, her telling me that was extremely hurtful, even though the comment is confusing as hell. I never angrily ranted with her or accused her of doing ANYTHING wrong, not once.

I was thinking maybe she knows she did me wrong and is just trying to deflect/shift blame to shut me up, get me to go away, or make me feel better. That's what a few people I know personally have said, but it still gnaws at me. Was she referring to one of the two mishaps I mentioned? Or was she just giving me a cold brush-off? I'm sure she was mad or annoyed that I accused her of ""there being someone else"" when she claims they only ""reconnected"" two weeks ago - but clearly there was history there between her and this other guy. Her version of events means she started seeing this guy only five weeks after she dumped me, which is a lot less time than I'd think she'd need to get some things in her life sorted out to get her in a good place to date (she said she was super-stressed out about trying to find a new job, etc).

Because of the way she's handled this, I've started questioning nearly everything that happened. I wonder if she used me for a thrill and/or gaslighted me because I feel so disoriented, or if she just lost interest after that initial spark and handled it poorly instead of being honest with me.

I should also add she has bipolar disorder - she's on meds for it but I do know that those meds are basically just a Band-Aid.

Does it sound like I did something that sounds like such a massive turn-off or screw-up that it would cause someone who seemed really into me to do a total 180? Or does this sound more like this was caused by her own issues, and that there was nothing here that I did that was so awful and unattractive?

The whole thing has made me feeling like I'm not good enough and questioning so much. I know none of you can read her mind for me, but any insight would be appreciated as I'm trying to make sense of all this and move forward. Thanks.",2019-07-08 17:50:18,10,0,relationship_advice
33,caobrq,96babyxo,My mom is clearly mentally ill and my dad does nothing.,"Let me say I love my dad! He is a great man. Very hardworking and a total family man. He's so hands on. He never complains. He cooks, he cleans, he does it all.

I am in my 20s but have several younger siblings. They are high school aged or younger. One is only 6. I don't live at home anymore.

I remmeber after my one sibling was born my mother's mental health really began to go downhill. She had very severe ppd and never left her room, lost a lot o weight, was very weepy etc. I was only about 13 myself so I can't remmeber all the details.. Just that it was a very dark time for the whole family. My dad never did anything really. He seemed oblivious to getting my mom the proper help. I think it was my grandma who forced her to a doctor and to get on meds.

She has not been totally herself since. She has chronic health problems such as fibro and pcos.. Migraines.. Debilitating periods... However I don't live there so I don't know the extent. She also behaves erratcily. Cannot hold a job. Is very quick to switch emotions and become very angry. Spends money and is always driving them to be broke and literally have to scavange for money. They never are in a good place financially bc she spends literally every penny he has.

He does not stop her! Even though she doesn't work she doesn't cook regularly and they often feed my siblings a ton of fast food. They don't have any displine at all. Her parenting style has changed a lot. She Also is often bed ridden.

I was visiting for a few days and there was two days she did not leave her room, at all. Not even to say hi to anyone. He would bring her food etc. The staying in hr dark bedroom all day thing clearly is still going on regularly.

Also my sister had an eating disorder and serious mental health problems and neither of them addressed the fact that she was 70 lbs and her health was totally deteriorating.. Til I came over and noticed and made a stink. Before I had come to visit they hadn't even mentioned to me she was not eating and had become so thin! After i brought it to attention and insisted she get help she is on meds now, and at a totally healthy weight. Thank God.

Anyways I just get confused why my father does not notice these things or see them as off? He just enables my moms behavior. He was oblivous to my sisters issues. I just don't
Get how he lives this way without seeing it as an issue. My mother is a tyrant and her and I don't always get along due to her behavior so it's a lost cause for me to try to tell her she should seek help. I just feel like how do you let her stay in bed for days and make stupid desicions like spending your grocery money on bs and think that's ok?",2019-07-08 17:49:48,2,1,relationship_advice
34,caoblx,Contact1997,I lied to my girlfriend and now she can't trust me,"I lied to my girlfriend about my ex.

I was dating my ex for exactly a year before I met my current girlfriend (let's call her mars) I started dating her after knowing her for two months, and I didn't breakup with my ex until I had been dating Mars for a month. It was at the end of the third month I broke up with my ex. Now to explain how much of a dick I am and how incredible mars is.

 I had been thinking of breaking up with my ex for a while already,  and it wasn't until way later that I could have pushed myself to do it. This of course would cause a lot of problems by itself,  but I went and lied about it too. 

So here's where Mars comes in so amazing at the beginning,  already saying that if I had anything to tell her I should do it then and get it over with,  because it was the beginning and she wanted to know what she was getting into,  and she said she wouldn't be angry because it was her choice that she accepted me and my baggage. Since it was the beginning and I wanted to continue the relationship I lied.  I was afraid it would've ended right then and there. 

Fast forward 3 months later, and she finds out through a third party (not to mention this third party is hated by us both) and now she's ready to pack up and leave me,  but we talked and talked and eventually decided that I would have to come out with everything right then. So I did, mostly. I told her everything I could think of,  but there were still things I had left out, and something I just didn't feel I could tell her,  which was when I broke up with my ex. 

Over the next couple weeks things were found out and there were more fights and I explained more. But at one point we had a fight and I realized I was still holding back and lying so I got up and told her I was still lying and that I believed I was a compulsive liar. We talked more and more, she convinced me out of that belief, and still,  I was given another chance.  

And it was from this point forward that I told her I was going to be honest with everything. But it was this moment that gave her nightmares and the lying changed her perspective of me completely.  She was so happy with me when we first met and thought I was everything she needed and wanted but now she feels she can't go back to that. 

Fast forward another few months and we decide to look for the conversations with my ex that I deleted to hide them. Now at this point i had discussed a lot with Mars about my ex and let her ask me anything she wanted about it. I told her what I believed to be the truth to all the questions she asked. So now her asking to see the conversations I wasn't afraid of anything other than maybe being embarrassed. It turns out that I had forgotten about when certain dates were and the timeline of how I explained things to Mars was pretty messed up. Now I'm freaking out cause it wasn't what I expected and I don't understand why my memories are different and I can't remember and Mars is freaking out more because the things she believed to be the truth,  weren't, and now she was going through the same thing again. 

So again we've had another discussion and she went through and looked at the conversation and asked me lots of questions (which I was fine with answering). And now things are tense still but the problem now is there's things I've said to my ex and they're similar or identical to things I've said to Mars. So now she has trouble believing me and if my feelings are true for her because she can't help but think back to the times I've said things to my ex and relate them to when I say or do things to or with her. 

So my question is how do I help her overcome this or be at peace with it? Or is this even the right thing to do? It is constantly tugging and pulling on her heart and I just want her to be happy with me and not feel that she's recycled or that I'm only with her because she just fits my tastes and that I'm with her cause she's the same as my ex. I reassure her of my feelings but also how do we stop having the thoughts of what I've done torment her mind? Part of her wants to act on the relationship and fix it and part of her doesn't care where it goes and would just let it die. How do we decide what to do?",2019-07-08 17:49:29,1,1,relationship_advice
35,caobj1,boomchuga,I‚Äôm a 28 year old guy struggling to get and keep an erection with my new gf. Has my past relationship scarred me?,"As the title indicates, I‚Äôm 28, in good shape (eat right and exercise), and I‚Äôm having troubling getting and maintaining erections during sex with my new girlfriend to the point that it‚Äôs giving her anxiety and making her feel like she‚Äôs doing something wrong. 

I‚Äôve recently come out of a 4 year relationship about 6 months ago that was at times emotionally abusive and really fucked with my head and my confidence level. I‚Äôve had this issue happen a while back with my ex, but that was after she had told me she wasn‚Äôt sexually attracted to me in a fight. After that, my head was fucked for weeks and couldn‚Äôt get an erection with her. This new girl is very sexually experienced, so obviously that is a little intimidating, but she‚Äôs crazy about me and thinks I‚Äôm sexy, and it kills me that I can‚Äôt get it up at times when I want to.  

I really like this new girl and want nothing more than to have great sex with her. I know the issue is mental and not physical - I can still get an erection when I masturbate or watch porn (I‚Äôve just stopped doing both in hopes that it would help). 

What‚Äôs odd about this issue is that there have been times when I‚Äôm comfortable and I‚Äôve been able to maintain an erecting and bring her to orgasm, but when the time comes for me to finish, I get in my head again and am unable to complete. I feel like a head-case. I just wanna enjoy being intimate with her. 

What the hell can I do fix this? Has anyone else experienced this?",2019-07-08 17:49:18,2,1,relationship_advice

37,caoaii,LeonTaughtYou,I [M29] cheated on my boyfriend [M26] twice. I want him back and willing to do the work.,"So I met my ex, ‚ÄúV‚Äù in October of 2018. We met at the gym through mutual friends and began seeing each other consistently soon there-after. I‚Äôve never been this attracted to someone both physically as well as psychologically and morally. In other words, I hit the jackpot!

When we met, I was having a ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù relationship with a few other people prior to meeting him. Fast forward to February, 2019 - he proposed the question of dating exclusively and making our relationship official. I was completely on board but stated I would need a couple of weeks to sever loose ends and cut-off contact with past ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù.

A few weeks into officially/exclusively dating, while taking a shower, V goes through my phone and sees that I still have someone that I had yet to completely cut off (Due to the emotions involved on their part, I took a little longer cutting that person off). 

V was upset and eventually ghosted me on all platforms. This completely shattered me! I wanted to explain how I was changing my life to be more aligned  and on the same page with each other. I called, sent DM‚Äôs, e-mail, created fake accounts, etc. until I finally got in touch with V.

We hashed everything out and agreed to start afresh. A lot of tears were involved. I really hurt V when he went through my phone and saw I didn‚Äôt cut everyone off. Another month goes by - we never argue and things seem to be going great. Everyone has been cut off with a couple of exceptions. 

This is were I screw up bad: due to my own internal bullshit, I slip up and fuck someone else behind V‚Äôs back. An old friend who is also in a relationship. Throughout the week, V and I continue to see each other consistently. 

While I do take longer to fall for someone, to say I was in love with V would be an understatement - this past week was incredible. Incredible up until Friday when he text me asking what I did earlier in the week (cheated). I tell him I hung out with some friends etc but he is eluding to the fact that I cheated. He kept saying ‚Äúhow small the world is‚Äù and how I should tell him what I did since he saw it for himself. 

I‚Äôm completely aloof, I knew what he was getting at but I played dumb until he provided more concrete evidence. I spill and tell him that I cheated. I know what I did was wrong. We had something so good, so rare.  So rare in fact, I pleaded with V to not break-up with me. Our connection was so strong, I begged that we work this out - we could be stronger/more connected if he allowed me the chance to learn how to love him correctly. 

He ultimately declined - said I cheated on him twice and that he can not do this. He said he never loved nor can love anyone in the way he loved me. I crushed him and his security/confidence. He asked for another break-up and blocked me on all social platforms a second time. 

At this point, I know I should give him space to collect his thoughts. He asked for a break-up so I will respect his wish but this is where I need advise: 

V is the love of my life!! I want to make our relationship work and I‚Äôm going to get my shit together in order to be the man V wants me to be as well as the man that I want to be for V. Over the next couple of months of our ‚Äúno contact‚Äù period, I‚Äôm going to work on myself and get to the root of my issues. Once I have worked through those issues, I will reach back out (assuming I‚Äôm unblocked by that point) and see if we can start over for a third time. Do you think I should reluctantly move on or fight for the man of my dreams?!

EDIT - I‚Äôm aware that we may never rekindle this incredible love due to my own selfish fuck-ups/shortcomings but is there chance V could take me back?!",2019-07-08 17:47:08,10,1,relationship_advice

I'm posting this to my alt account on the off chance my fiance knows my regular account (I don't think he does, but whatever, I have the alt, might as well use it).

**TL:DR;** My fiances wants me to change my last name to his, I don't want to.

Long version:

I grew up with my parents not having the same last name. It never bothered me, and I always just thought I'd keep my name.

My fiance really wants me to change my name because he feels like we won't be a family otherwise.

I've offered to hyphenate my name and even go by his name unofficially (aka not legally change my name but use his in day-to-day life), but he just really wants our names to be the same.

Even after a very emotional conversation last night I still don't want to change my name. Like I said, I've offered to hyphenate my name and go by his informally but I don't want to get rid of mine entirely. 

Now, this isn't a deal breaker to us getting married (we've been together nearly 8 years as-is), but it's a bigger issue than I initially thought it was and I can't stop thinking about it.

My fiance has his reasons and I'm happy to share them privately with people but on the off chance he finds this post, I don't want to put his business out there like that without his permission. I figure this post is vague enough that he won't get offended if he finds it, but who knows.

I just need some advice and some opinions on this.

It‚Äôs a bit of a long story, so I really appreciate anybody who reads it through fully. I‚Äôve[M24] been with my girlfriend [F21] for almost 4 years now.

Right at the start of the relationship, I told her that in 6 months I was moving away (which I was) to another country to study for a year.

At the same time, I was very much going to study abroad knowing it would probably end and I could well meet a girl abroad - I wasn‚Äôt very committed let‚Äôs say.

Around a month into me going abroad, we have a massive fight over Skype and she breaks up with me there and then. During this break, I got very close to (and did more than kissing but not sex) with this other girl. I then ended up getting back with my girlfriend and tell her what happened, and she goes absolutely ballistic at me and tells me to never talk to this girl again. I ignored what my girlfriend said (but lied and said I would stop) and still kept talking to this other girl, 1) because I wanted to be a decent human being and not make it seem like I‚Äôd just used her, and 2) because she was actually my friend. Eventually, I did stop talking to that other girl, but for a while my behaviour was shady. There‚Äôd be times where I‚Äôd flirt with other girls and lie about exactly what I was doing to my girlfriend (e.g. say I said I was going for a perfectly innocent coffee with a male friend but it was actually a girl - I lied because she‚Äôd react extremely negatively). I never cheated on her, but the shady behaviour I did in hindsight was because at the time I never saw a future with her, so I was just like ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù. Eventually, things got better, my behaviour was much better, and my feelings grew for her again.

Fast forward nearly 3 years, it‚Äôs going extremely well with my girlfriend and see myself marrying her one day. Yet, I feel like that part of my life is so clouded. Despite being with my girlfriend today, I have regret and guilt over the fact we broke up in the first place. I feel guilty about lying about saying I‚Äôd stop talking to the other girl (at least in the first instance). I feel guilty that I‚Äôd been a bit flirty with other girls and had conflicted thoughts. I feel guilty for never being 100% committed, until I realised just how much she means to me. I feel guilty for it seeming like I‚Äôd ‚Äúused‚Äù the other girl during the break - in honesty it was more of a rebound relationship, but became intimate very fast. 

Even as recently as 7 months ago, I had a long time close female friend seemingly trying to flirt with me. At the time, the relationship wasn‚Äôt in a great place (we were arguing a lot) so I was almost curious to see what this female friend was up to. Nevertheless, I stopped letting the female friend play mind games with me and remembered how much I love my girlfriend.

I want to be able to move forward in my relationship knowing it‚Äôs honest, truthful and that I‚Äôm being the best person I can. I love my girlfriend, but I don‚Äôt want the weight of these past things to hold me back, or make me feel like I‚Äôm hiding anything. We‚Äôve already been through a lot - I can‚Äôt exactly just tell her ‚Äúoh yeah you know 2 years ago when I said I was going for a coffee with X, it was actually Y‚Äù. Or ‚Äúoh yeah at that time I didn‚Äôt see us going anywhere so flirted a bit with another girl‚Äù. The point is, I can‚Äôt just bring up this past stuff that isn‚Äôt really worth bringing up with her. Because every time I bring it up she‚Äôll think ‚Äúoh here we go again something else that happened‚Äù, and then I‚Äôll probably remember something else, feel guilty again damage the trust even more. Everyone I‚Äôve spoken to about this whole situation - family, close friends, tells me to let it go. Some would probably say these aren‚Äôt even bad things - it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôve slept with 5 women and not told her. 

At times, the guilt/regret/anxiety about it all just piles up on top of me and I start to question if the relationship has a future. Not because I don‚Äôt love her, but because of what‚Äôs happened. Is there a way I can push past this, without bringing it all up with her - knowing I‚Äôm not a bad person. Please help me.",2019-07-08 17:45:24,1,1,relationship_advice
40,cao9be,throwaway991100221,I am so hurt and confused. Need help," I will try to make this short.

I 33(F, African American) am dating an African guy (36). To be straightforward, he is the total package. Looks, career, attitude, the way he treats me, treats others, EVERYTHING. But there is a problem.

I learned after dating him that he was the product of parental kidnapping, as his parents got divorced and his mom got full custody. His dad spent years traveling the world with him and his sibling, as a means of evading his mom. And I learned apparently, that African men have the highest rate of parental kidnappings, according to FBI. Basically, don't try to take an African man's child or you'll have to start searching the whole world for your kids. Guy I'm seeing has clearly been affected by this, and his remedy is the issue.

I like this guy, I see myself ending up with him. I see myself growing old with him. But he has decided while he wants kids, he has refused to have one with a significant other, so as not to do to his kids what was done to him, and according to him, US courts will automatically give away his kids. So his remedy for this is surrogacy.

And by that, I mean he has stated that he wants to have a child, and is willing to use surrogacy. He intends on paying some random lady to have his kids, and then stated that he'd never allow any woman that comes in his life to be close enough to even want to adopt said child. As that defeats the purpose of using surrogacy in the first place. (His biggest fear is losing his children that he doesn't have yet).. I have tried understanding his point of view, but I wonder where that leaves me. What that says about him, not caring about the lady in his life.

Last week I was over at his, and decided to check something online using his laptop, and I noticed he had an open tab and been researching agencies. Worried, I went into his phone while he was sleeping. (He doesn't have passwords, as he claims if he lost his phone or it was stolen, a locked phone won't guarantee it's return). I noticed he had multiple email conversations with some agencies about starting the process. I freaked out and woke him up and confronted him about it. He never said anything about me going through his phone, but got mad at me for being upset about him making a decision about his life.

To be fair, he brought it up on our first date when I asked him about kids, but I thought it was something he, like most guys say today when they think they won't find anyone.

I know I should leave, as I want to have my own children with the man in my life, and raise said kids together. And I know I want to be with this man.

At age 15 when his dad felt he was old enough, as he is the youngest of 5, his dad allowed their mom to meet up with the kids. Apparently she spent 15 years chasing them and got so used to it, that when she finally had them, didn't know what to do with them. He never really had a relationship with her, and she passed away when he was 25.

I am confused. He had made his stance clear, and I have issued with this, but I do t want to leave this perfect man. And yes I understand no matter how perfect, they come with one massive flaw. It seems his is not wanting to start a family with anyone.

Please help. As I think I'm calling in love with him.

46,cao80k,ThrowAway_ToTakeAway,This needs to change -.-,"For a while now, I've  (18F) been having issues pop up with a lot of people I care about where I act selfishly without always realizing. It isn't even that. I know my shortcomings. I just dont have a clear plan on fixing it. For one, I can't bring myself to listen to people when they talk. I just find myself zoning out a bit, and it ends up resulting in me making people think I don't care enough to listen to them. Another issue is even if I listen, when put on the spot and asked about it I panic and I forget. Obviously it looks like that I didnt listen or didnt care to remember in the other person's eyes. Plus, I just find myself not really being mindful enough or just understanding what someone is doing for me. Like, for example, if I was playing a game and someone is helping me by gathering materials I just end up gathering them myself? Even if that's the whole reason they're there, essentially wasting their time since I'm defeating the purpose. Then, I'm just always too worried. As soon as something bad happens in my relationship or with anyone else, due to these shortcomings? I freak out and blank out. Like I mentioned, I can't think right in those moments, nor can I remember things for my life. I start to talk and apologize, but it's all talk. I don't really give a concrete way to help the situation, I just end up talking about how sorry I am and such.

I need to end this. I dont always want to be hurting people like this. I want to be a better listener, I want to show them that I'm not selfish, I want to show them their time is valuable, I dont want to be worried so much, I dont want to make excuses for myself.

48,cao7bb,whoselieisitanyway,Surviving short-term lack of satisfaction in relationship with my (23f) boyfriend (25m),"**Bolded advice request at the bottom:**

My (23f) boyfriend (25m) and I have been dating for about seven months. He is  still in school and in the middle of doing an intensive summer program across the country. The program's schedule makes it so he hardly has time to do anything for himself, let alone put any energy towards our relationship. 

While understanding, I have been having an increasingly hard time in the relationship. We talk for two hours max each week with some very light and scattered texting. When we do talk, it tends to be mostly about his program and how busy and fun things are there. I've always proudly been fairly independent in our relationship so I'm still busy with friends, family, work, and my own hobbies, but life for me is pretty much the same except he's not there. And I would not date him if he didn't make it better. It's been hard not seeing him, and harder not to have him there to support me during both the good and the bad. While I can easily do my own thing, I miss him feeling like a part of my world. And I feel so detached from his very busy and very fun world. 

Even when we can talk, I hang up the phone feeling incredibly sad. If you subscribe to love languages, I would say mine are definitely physical touch and quality time. A phone call is wonderful, but doesn't leave me feeling connected and loved in the same way. 

We both recognize this is harder on me. He's so absorbed in his program and so it all feels like it is moving fast for him. It couldn't be slower on my end.

I love the man and I've been communicative in saying that I need additional effort put in to help me through this program. He tries his best, but I am still struggling hard with it. I know it is a short-term problem and he will be definitively coming back home after the summer, **but any advice on surviving the second half of this (shriving long distance as a quality time/physical affection needing partner) would be appreciated.**",2019-07-08 17:40:55,1,1,relationship_advice
49,cao781,goofy25858,My best friend of 5 years came out as gay to my girlfriend after just 30 minutes of messaging. Ive been completely oblivious and he hasnt come out to me yet.,"Yesterday i (16M) shared my best mates‚Äô(16M) snapchat with my girlfriend of 5 months (16F) and introduced him to her today for a nice day chilling down the shopping centre. It was a great day and we had fun just talking and walking around, once in a while dropping into a shop or grabbing a coffee together. 

Anyways after roughly 4 hours i took my girlfriend home and parted ways with my best mate. Upon coming home me and gf talked about a wide range if things including how she liked my friend and i re-assured her that he liked her as well. Well anyway eventually we got on to talking to him in general and his overall obsession for visiting London. She also told me that he wanted to go to a pride parade on Sunday and i told her i knew, and that he‚Äôd expressed interest in going to watch one before. Well then she hinted to me that he wanted to join in and i was a little confused and then asked her if she knew something i didnt. She bluntly told me that yesterday after little more than a 30 min convo my best friend had come out to her as gay, and that only a couple people knew (me not being one of them evidently)

After that i felt a huge mix of emotions. Predominantly i was proud of him for 1) being gay 2) coming out to some people and 3) managing to keep it hidden for so long. As well as that i felt a little confusion as id never really considered him to be anything but straight in the past and finally there was that tiny bit of hurt as to why he‚Äôd come out to my gf after so little time and not me.

So fellow Redditors i need your help. Im not sure what i should do in this situation. Have i been unknowingly doing things to make him feel less open about his sexuality? Should i approach him and express my supportiveness and pride for him or should i let him come out to me of his own accord? Do I tell him that i know he‚Äôs not straight or pretend to be oblivious? Finally, is it bad that i haven‚Äôt noticed before? Looking back he has never expressed interest in girls and dresses ‚Äúquirky‚Äù as we say together but i didnt ever really put two and two together because i hate making assumptions about people. Im really at a loss here!

TLDR: My best friend of multiple years came out as gay to my girlfriend after a short time but not to me yet. Im not sure what to do or if i should have noticed his lack of interest in girls earlier.",2019-07-08 17:40:43,6,1,relationship_advice

51,cao68e,WinterRice,Bad idea for me [22M] to see my ex [22F]?,"We mutually ended a 2 year relationship four months ago. Logistically things were a nightmare, and that seeped into the way we treated each other. We knew things weren't the same or as fun anymore. 

I still had love for her and vice versa. While we dated we were best friends and talked daily. Things didn't end on bad terms, just a lot of crying. We didn't talk about our future; we have no idea what we'll want or if we'll ever work out again. 

We talked occasionally after the break up but I eventually stopped contacting her (I let her know before I ghosted her) because it seemed weird to text her but never actually hang out in person. I also wanted time to focus on myself. Talking to her as a friend after breaking up gave me a weird feeling, like I was running in place. 

So we haven't spoken in over a month, and haven't seen each other since we broke up. 

Last night, one of her college friends invited me to a birthday party, and I saw my ex was invited and is going. My ex texted me and said that her friend (they don't talk too often) must not have known about us, but that I should still come if I can. 

To be completely honest; I really want to see her. I do miss her a lot as a friend. I just don't know if this will bring back old wounds and if I'll regret it. Before I went no contact with her we had planned to meet up but it never really worked out.

52,cao5di,SlightlyCareless,am I too carefree with my sister? Me (21F) and sister (43F),"Before I start, I don't know if I chose the right title, but at the moment it felt like I was being that way. Hopefully it'll make sense when I continue.

hey everybody, this just happened a few hours ago and I haven't felt this way in a while, I usually just deal with family matters in a more private way but this time I felt like I needed to vent.

It started yesterday, I asked my sister if she wanted to go tomorrow (a.k.a today) to the park and do a little bit of exercise. She accepted and asked me to call her when I woke up so she could wake up as well. I've done this before so it was no big deal. 

When I called her today she told me that she would pick me up at the bus stop, instead of my house, I agreed. I'm very *very* flexible whenever she asks me to do something. I never complain, I always ask what's better for her (obviously I would've preferred if she picked me up at my house but if she can't then it's ok) and I always find a way to do it. 

She called me when she left the house so I would start heading to the bus stop. I know she always takes a bit of time to get there (just anywhere in general) so I waited a few minutes and asked my mom if she could give me a ride. When i was near the bus stop she called me, and I immediately noticed she was angry. You know how you can notice when someone's angry by their tone and the words they use? Well, that's what happened to me that very moment. 

She asked me where I was, and I told her I was right there but I couldn't cross because the light was red (where I live jaywalking is very common, so she might've expected me to do so) but I told her that I would be there in just a few seconds. I said ""See you in a bit, bye"" and she coldly replied ""bye"" and hung up. As soon as she did that I turned to my mom and said ""She's angry""

My mom (unsurprisingly as she's my mom) told me that what's the point of me going if she's angry, that I wouldn't enjoy it. I dismissed her words, not giving it much importance and thinking that once we get to the park my sister wouldn't feel that way anymore.

I got to the car, and I said ""hey, what's up""

""I wanted to save time"" 

and it's usually not what you say, but how you say it. and she was angry.

""If you want to save time, you can ask me to meet up at the park""

I guess it was what I said at that point, but she responded ""Why are you angry?""

""I'm not angry, but you don't go saying what you said to me and not expect some kind of reaction""

What she said was a bit passive aggressive, or at least that's how I felt it, maybe I shouldn't have said anything but I'm sure she's a capable adult of thinking ""Maybe I should keep quiet"" as well. Sometimes the best thing to do is say nothing at all.

I added ""you don't go poking the bear and expect nothing in return""

""Wow"" she said in disbelief, and as she kept driving we almost got into an accident (there was a car that was trying to merge back into traffic, she got awfully close not allow the car to merge and she started honking at it. I may not have much experience, in fact, I'm currently learning how to drive, but regardless of whose at fault I would've kept my distance)

We got to the park, no word from her. We got out of the car, she went straight ahead, not even looking at me and she went to her usual spot to do warm ups. At that point, I said to my self ""What's the point?""

I started crying, which took me by surprise, I called my mom and got the reassurance I needed. She told me that i've gone to the park before on my own and that I could just do my thing and leave. I started walking and then I saw my sister ran past by me. As I said, i was hoping that she would feel better and maybe talk to me (at this point it wasn't about blaming someone, it was about not being angry with one another. It sucks having a strained relationship) but she just went past by me. At that moment I decided to head back home.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to put the TL;DR version of this, maybe we're both at fault, or maybe none of us are at fault. I don't know. I was never angry throughout this whole ordeal, I'm just...sad.

What could've I had done to better this situation? Should I even be the one to reach out?",2019-07-08 17:37:01,4,1,relationship_advice
53,cao5b3,brandoesco,My mentally ill mom is now homeless and I don‚Äôt know what to do,"This is a long one, and I know that there is no easy answer. My mom has dealt with depression for my whole life, but a few years ago it got... weird. She has been hospitalized twice in 2 years for psychotic/manic episodes. She hasn‚Äôt had her own place for 10 years, living with me, random friends, and for the past few years her mother (my grandmother.) This has really strained our relationship, as I was constantly worrying about her both mentally and physically. She was very unhappy most of this time, and unhappiness leads to lashing out- especially at me. She had moved in with my grandmother after running out of friends to stay with, and when she and my grandma stopped getting along she moved in with me... into my college apartment with my roommates. I ended up having to rent a 2 bedroom apt for the both of us. I was supporting both of us,  but eventually she got a job and started seeing a doctor. 

During this time (she stayed with me for a year and a half, in the middle of my university experience) she started talking to my grandma again and decided to move back in with her. She went through a series of minimum wage jobs , but never had to pay rent or any bills. Soon after moving back in together my grandma went through a series of falls, other heath issues, and a diagnosis of vascular dementia, so she would need almost constant care. My mom was already living there, so the role of taking her to appointments and changing her diapers fell on my mom. One of my aunts would come over when mom had to work. 


My mom quickly became very unhappy with the situation, but never tried to change it. She would just call me and complain about, but never talk to the family about how unhappy she was. A few years ago she was diagnosed bipolar after her first hospitalization (to this day the most terrifying thing I have ever been through-it seemed more psychotic than manic but that‚Äôs another story.)The family got together afterwards(my mom‚Äôs 2 sisters that are in the picture) and talked about what to do going forward. Grandmother still needed care but mom wasn‚Äôt happy with working (as she saw it) 24/7 with her only ‚Äúbreak‚Äù being when she went to her actual job. They all decided that mom would quit her part time retail job and officially start taking care of my grandmother for a small payment every week, in addition to the free room and board she had been receiving. My aunts would alternate shifts so my mom would have 2 nights off per week as well as Sunday mornings. Mom went on a vacation to Florida after getting out of the hospital and came home to the new set up. However, it didn‚Äôt take long until she was unhappy again. She wasn‚Äôt getting along with my grandmother, they were arguing all the time, and the house was a disaster. A lot of other stuff happened but for the point of the story, I‚Äôll skip to what is going on now. 

One day last month, my mom just LEFT the house. She said that she was done, couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore, and the rest of the family needed to figure out another plan for caring for my grandma. She didn‚Äôt want any part of it. My moms brother, who lives in town but had been pretty much MIA for the past several years stepped up to help out, but my two aunts were FURIOUS. They are both sweet and loving and have tried to accommodate my mom and her issues as best they could, but her just leaving and not saying anything was the final straw. My very subdued, quiet aunt got into a huge fight with mom, and ended up having to stop everything she was doing (had just been told that the lot they were renting was going to be sold, so they either had to buy it or move and lose their trailer) to come stay with my grandma in addition to her full time job. So my mom left my grandmas house and started staying with her one friend, but this woman is a drug addict and also has mental issues so I was getting plenty of phone calls from my mom about issues with this woman- stuff going missing, arguments, etc. 



I have had a weird/bad relationship with my mom for awhile now as a result of her mental illness (she gets mad and lashes out/guilts me/generally just not fun to be around.) I stopped talking to her a few months ago after her last hospitalization (she physically fought one of her best friends, was trying to cast out demons/fight a spiritual battle for my soul and ended up getting arrested. I had to take 3 days off of work, bail her out of jail, take her against her will to the hospital.) Ever since I started talking to her again after our 2ish months of very LC, our relationship has been strained and all she does when we talk is complain about how unhappy she is, she does so much for other people but no one can do the same for her, and just general unhappiness. I don‚Äôt know how to respond when she calls me and starts talking like that, so I don‚Äôt even like seeing her name show up on my phone because I know exactly how the convo is about to go.

I first caught wind last week that things weren‚Äôt going good at the house she was staying at and that she might get kicked out of there, and I was a nervous wreck about her living situation. I live in another town with my boyfriend in a 1bedroom apartment. Since her last hospitalization, I have almost become numb to my mom, in a way. I have spent my whole life but especially the last few years constantly worrying and stressing about my mom and her wellbeing and it has taken a toll on me. I finally just stopped caring. I still love her but I just can‚Äôt deal with her anymore. I finally got up the nerve to tell her that i didn‚Äôt think it would be good for either of us for her to come stay with me. She doesn‚Äôt have anywhere else to go but when I let her stay with me before she wasn‚Äôt happy and neither was I. Only after she acknowledged that she didn‚Äôt want to have to stay with me did I finally feel good about talking to my mom, and this past week I would actually answer her calls and want to talk to her. It was awesome, we were getting a long for the first time in a long time. Then she called me yesterday and told me that the girl she was staying with kicked her out. I told mom that she needed go talk to the aunts and grandma- apologize for what happened and see if she could move back in. After all Mom needs somewhere to live, my grandma needs someone looking after her... so my mom went over there to talk to them. And they told her, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Apparently they have made it work without her- after all she wasn‚Äôt getting along with my grandma and wouldn‚Äôt keep the house clean. Plus my mom and the one aunt got into a huge fight and probably said some terrible things to each other. I already told her that she can‚Äôt stay with me but now she really has nowhere to stay. I would have no problem letting my mom stay with me a for a few weeks but I am afraid that it would be much longer than that and we would all be miserable. I told her to contact the church but it seems they weren‚Äôt able to help her. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do and need some advice about my role in this situation. I am the only daughter. To reiterate, she chose to leave her housing situation initially and now has nowhere to stay. Do I let her figure it out or take her in? 

TLDR- mom is bipolar, left her housing but then changed her mind and wanted back in, they said no. Am I supposed to let her come stay with me or let her figure it out herself?",2019-07-08 17:36:53,1,2,relationship_advice

55,cao4fa,livefires,How do I fix myself when it comes to my relationship,"I have never been like this before. I was once cheated on years back, never thought it had affected me in such a big way. I never used to be jealous, at all. If anything I was the complete opposite, I would never suspect a thing even if it was staring me in the face. It probable explains why I got cheated on. 

I am now in a relationship, have been for a year and a half and I love him. I really do. I couldn't ask for anyone better and he has never done anything wrong to me, he has never went behind my back and yes there has been a few things which I haven't agreed with that he has done but nothing major. 

Yet here I am, the most jealous bitch around and I hate it. I HATE it. I don't want to be jealous. I have tried so hard to not be, yet it doesn't work. I can't seem to control this. 

He hates this about me. It's the only thing he does hate about me and I understand why, So I have started hiding it as much as I can because I don't want it to destroy us, but he knows it's there.

Over the past year it has kind of dwindled, we‚Äôre too tired or had a stressful day so I thought I‚Äôd try and spice it up again because I know I haven‚Äôt initiated a lot lately because so many things have been happening I don‚Äôt really know how to cope and sex has been the last thing on my mind.

I sent him the message and waited, an hour later he messaged me back and it was the weakest response, so as the day has gone on now I just feel embarrassed with myself and hurt for being such an idiot and getting so hyped up over nothing, I have just plummeted back down to feeling like the least attractive person in the world.

57,cao4cg,eggsontoast00,How to tell conservative Christian girlfriend I may possibly be bisexual?,"Title says all.

I've been having feelings I may be bisexual, or at least a heteroromantic bisexual. I have never found a guy cute or wanted to pursue a relationship with a guy, but when I'm horny, I imagine having sex with guys and girls. Maybe its literally just me being horny, but I dont know. I've heard this happening with other guys also. This may seem weird, but I've always had odd fantasies involving anal sex, and I feel like these gay fantasies satisfy that. I also watch gay and straight porn, and I have been since I was a child, I feel like I've conditioned myself to get off to gay porn along with straight porn, and watching gay porn because it has strictly anal and that's what I've always had a thing for. As soon as I orgasm though, all sexual thoughts about guys leave, and seem unappealing, but the ones with girls stay and I know I'm still attracted to them. 

What's going on with me? Should I tell my girlfriend that I may be bisexual, or am I just horny?",2019-07-08 17:34:44,3,4,relationship_advice
58,cao3dq,sombercheese,I (26F) believe I'm infatuated with my fianc√©'s (29M) brother (33M).,"I'd like to start by saying that I have no intention of acting on it and frankly I'm very confused by it all, which is the reason why I am making this post. I will be using H to refer to my fianc√©'s brother. 

&amp;#x200B;

My wedding is going to happen in 5 months, I've been with my fianc√© for 3 years now. I have met H from the very beginning and I never had any thoughts on him besides that he was a pleasant friendly guy. A few months back me and H started talking a lot more to each other, at first it was during family gatherings and things like that and after we started texting. I want to make clear that none of these conversations went beyond talking about how our days went or talking about movies and tv shows. The only change was that I started seeing him more as a friend.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem now is that I think I'm starting to mix things. I first noticed once I realized that I would look foward to H messages all day and I would get so excited when he texted me. After that there was an instance where I was texting H and he was ranting about a colleague of his and my fianc√©  was around and he asked me why I was smiling so big and I lied to him. I cut back on the texting for a while after this but I ended up going back to it. What's alarming me at this point is that I started thinking about hanging out with H and how nice would it be to have him around. I confess that I fantasized about kissing him and I honestly feel terrified.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where this is coming from and I tried my best to figure out. My relationship with my fianc√© has been great, he's everything I could ever ask for in a guy and while all of this has been going on I still keep looking foward to our wedding and to have this moment with him and building a life with him. I'm satisfied with how my life is right now. Yet, I still have these thoughts about H and they are making me feel so disgusted and anxious. It's even worse because he certainly sees this as a friendship as he never made any type of move on me nor said anything that could be disrespectful to me. Meanwhile I'm having all those thoughts about him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I haven't texted him in 4 days, the last message I sent was that work was about to be crazy and I wouldn't be able to talk much. He still sent good morning and good night texts. I decided to throw myself into work and finish organizing my wedding in the meantime. I can't talk to anyone about this which is why I'm asking for help. I don't know where it went wrong or if it was wrong from the beginning but I want to make it right.",2019-07-08 17:32:38,6,1,relationship_advice
59,cao39v,oofXD420,Will watching pornography during sex eventually turn into habit?,"   I'm a 20/F and my S/O is 23/M that's been together in a relationship  living with each other for a few months. I'd like to think we  have a pretty honest and open sex life together. We're both aware of each other's porn use when we privately masturbate in the shower or bed when it's more convenient/we're too tired to have sex. We both have a high sex drive and attraction to each other and somehow pull off having sex at least one time a day on top of cumming via masturbation. 

   When either of us needs ""alone time"" we both respect and encourage each other's privacy and don't question anything. I've even let him use my phone a few times to watch porn when his has been dead. One time he walked out after he was finished and hilariously yelled ""SHOOT YOUR JIZZ AND OUT YOU IS."" I'm really fortunate not to feel ashamed about pleasing myself and that my partner doesn't feel offended when I choose that over having sex and I assume he feels the same.

   Recently we were in the middle of some sloppy drunk fucking and he proposed pulling up porn and watching it together. I was down and he ended up cumming pretty fast after the video started. I didn't think anything of it until now because porn has been introduced countless times since then. (Like almost 40% of the times we've had sex.) I've compared our sex while watching porn as opposed to not incorporating it. I think it's hot and I don't mind but it just seems like it's a lot easier for him to get off while it's playing rather than just having sex with me. I'm worried he'll eventually not be able to have an orgasm unless porn's playing in front of us. Am I overreacting/over thinking it? If I were to have a conversation with him about it how should I address it without sounding like a buzz kill that's against it?",2019-07-08 17:32:25,4,1,relationship_advice
60,cao35t,Remarkable_Storage1,New girlfriend (29F) lied to me (27M) about seeing other people. Should I be concerned?,"EDIT: Note,  she saw other people BEFORE we officially became bf/gf.

I've known this woman for about 3.5 months, and we've been dating for 1.5 of them.

Just about 1 week into dating her,  I got to a point where I could not meet her for about 2 weeks because of family commitments. She appeared to understand at the time.

We've been meeting fairly regularly since, and eventually it got to the point where we had sex for the first time (yesterday). As we were lying in bed afterwards, she confessed to me that during the 2 weeks I was unavailable, she dated other people. This surprised me, because BEFORE I was away for 2 weeks, I asked whether she was seeing anyone else and she said no, she wasn't the type to date around.

I think NORMALLY I would cut my losses and run for hills. I asked her why she continued to date me afterwards, and she said it was because I told her at the end of that 2 week period, I ended up not going to someone's birthday celebration so I could be with her - so she got the idea that I really cared for her. I think she had some sort of idea that I was messing around with other people at the time, I'm not really sure.

I don't think she's seeing other people now, because she's spent a fairly big amount of time with me lately, including the whole of last weekend, and been helping me out with a bunch of things (like IKEA furniture - the bed we slept on together). Also, for whatever reason, I thought it'd be a good idea to ask if she wanted to be my girlfriend yesterday, and she said yes.

Even then, a part of me is kinda...cautious and worried I might be making a huge mistake. It'd be good to get insight from anyone else to see whether I'm doing so, and should break things off before I get REALLY hurt. Does anyone have any experience with this kinda situation?",2019-07-08 17:32:15,3,1,relationship_advice
61,cao31k,meows8,Do I go visit him in jail?,"Guys... this is an insane story and I feel insane for contemplating this. I‚Äôve gone back and forth about this and I want peoples opinions.

I met this guy and we went on a first date... we hit it off so well that we made plans for the next night...we texted nonstop...then we make plans for the next day as well - we spent three days together and texted each-other nonstop. We both agreed that we‚Äôd never had this type of connection before and that spending so much time together right off the bat was not what either of us was used to. 

The catch is... he got a DUI last year and is now serving his 10 days in jail for it. This guy was so torn up about leaving me, like I‚Äôve never experienced this. He even called me right before his court appearance. 

The idea of surprising him and showing up to ‚Äúvisit‚Äù him has crossed my mind. I know he‚Äôs probably bored as heck in there and I thought it would be a nice surprise to go say hi.... but I‚Äôm also scared that this comes off as complete batshit crazy.

62,cao28w,worldswithinwords,My (17F) boyfriend (17M) and I act like an older couple. Is this normal?,"So, some background: 
My boyfriend and I have been friends since fifth grade, and I moved to another state in eighth grade. Before I left, I told him about a crush I had on him, and we started going out in eighth grade due him wanting to not hurt me. That sounds bad, I know. 
I originally didn't know this, but I found out from him about six months into the relationship. I was like, ""well, do you like me now?"" to which he replied that yes, yes he did. 
So we move forward with our relationship. Which was long distance, by the way. Along the way we have run into various problems, but we solved them by talking to each other and not blaming the other. I care for him too much to unfairly blame him, and vice versa.
We're both in eleventh grade right now, and what kind of bothers me is that a few more of my friends are in relationships as well, but none of them are as comitted with making their relationship work as well, and they sound really surprised when they hear how serious we actually are about each other.

A year ago we moved in with each other and things were amazing, but also not so amazing. That‚Äôs just how stuff is in my eyes because no relationship is perfect. Either way this past year has been the happiest year of my life. 

I had a lot of shit happen In my life and because of that I‚Äôm not okay mentally all the time. I have really bad depression and sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm bipolar but i haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with that yet.. because of these things I can‚Äôt drink around him. It has caused so many bad memories, so I tried to stop. We would both only drink occasionally(1 or 2 drinks max) and never really ‚Äúpartied‚Äù anymore. Except holidays like New Years and stuff, we would actually drink more. Most of the time things never ended badly like they had been. . 

So for a while things were perfect. Last week was one of those times where we do drink a little more. On the 4th of course. Shit went bad. Because of me. It‚Äôs like I truly hate him with all my heart when this happens. I can‚Äôt control it and I know I don‚Äôt hate him. I‚Äôve never cared about anyone more and I‚Äôve never did any of these things to him while completely sober. It‚Äôs not ‚Äòme‚Äô ... I‚Äôve never understood why I do this. It doesn‚Äôt always happen. I try to control it and most of the time I don‚Äôt even remember that I‚Äôve done it. It doesn‚Äôt happen when I drink TOO much. Because we‚Äôve had great times. It just happens when I drink more .. idk 

We agreed that we can‚Äôt keep doing this and I know he deserves better and always has deserved more. We  aren‚Äôt on bad terms. But now I‚Äôm living alone in our house with all our memories. I can‚Äôt afford to move right now or I would. I just want to know how do I move on. I‚Äôm still so hurt by this but I know I caused it so it‚Äôs what i deserve.

This lady is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen and since I am a lesbian I was naturally attracted to her. Towards the beginning of our friendship, I have often found myself on the verge of asking her for a kiss on the mouth, but I was able to restrain myself at the last moment. All day long, I would dream of her well toned physique, her flawless face and her sweet smell.

Gradually, I started repressing these feelings by working more than usual. I was scared that I would end up causing her some discomfort which would ruin our friendship forever. Things went along quite smoothly. In fact, her presence around me impacted me in a positive way. I excelled at work and earned a promotion too.

My roommate played squash in her college days and has the physique of an athlete. She is atleast five inches taller and thirty pounds heavier than me. She habitually mocked me for being ""skinny"" and physically weak. I brushed of these jibes quite sportingly until yesterday.

I had had a difficult day at work yesterday and her taunts got to me. She boasted about how she expected to defeat me easily in a wrestling match. I felt so humiliated that I offered her a bet that she wouldn't. She replied that she was ready to bet me ""anything"".

Surprisingly, I won the wrestling game and my friend was positively exhausted at the end of it. She admitted defeat but I was intent on claiming my bet. All the physical contact with her might have excited me because I went on to give her a few oil-checks in her bottom as soon as she was lying on her stomach. She pleaded with me to let her go but I went on give her one more of those disgusting anal probes before eventually releasing her. She remarked that she would think twice before challenging me in the future. **I am ashamed of the way I have behaved.** It is true that I did not take of her clothes, but I understand that my actions might be considered sexual harassment or even rape. I apologised to her several times but she merely laughed it off.She complained of bit of soreness in her bottom. I offered to take her to the doctor and confess immediately but she felt that was unnecessary.

I know I have behaved like an animal. My roommate might suffer from lifelong trauma. The worst bit is that she hasn't moved out yet. Should I report myself to the police? How shall I ensure that I am adequately punished?",2019-07-08 17:28:52,4,0,relationship_advice

He is working on transferring to a Uni from a jr college for his Masters. He has chronic pain from a spinal injury and he has been extremely stressed these past few weeks, so much that he was diagnosed with stress induced eczema. His living situation stresses him out because his roommates are slobs and there‚Äôs not much communication between them (they had one more person move in to an already crowded house...with a dog, there‚Äôs 2 dogs already). He also has to incorporate some sort of physical activity in his weekly routine to help manage his pain so he stresses out when he is not able to meet his goals for physical activity. And on top of that, his classes are quite challenging as he‚Äôs working to become an engineer.

My go to‚Äôs for cheering him up are getting him his favorite snack, cooking for him, leaving him notes to let him know I love him/thank him/appreciate him, inviting him to take my dog to the dog park (he loves my dog), sleeping over if he‚Äôs had an extra rough day, sending him old pictures that bring happy memories.

He‚Äôs a fantastic partner and he is prone to depression and he is also dealing with body dysmorphia (he was in the military when he was injured). I encourage him to try therapy again (he has tried it in the past but I think he hasn‚Äôt found the right therapist for him). I guess I would just like to know what else I can do.

After some previous toxic relationships. I feel like theres been a weight on me and i have become quiet and reserved, a trait that i am content with. With my male friends i tend to be chatty and joke around but with my girlfriend who i spend all my time with and live with technically - tends to get upset when i‚Äôm blunt.

I put in a lot of effort to contradict this and communicate with her effectively and i do quite well. Sometimes though i find that i‚Äôll be more reserved than usual without any reason and she tends to get upset.

At the beginning of our relationship we used to talk non stop over text and we don‚Äôt do that often any more. I struggle to talk. It‚Äôs just me and i don‚Äôt know what more i can do without ‚ÄúPutting in more effort‚Äù which i already do. 

I‚Äôm not sure why i‚Äôm like this, I have bad hearing and a horrible memory and sometimes that can effect my relationship and communication skills but i try give her the light of day and listen to everything she has to say. 

She loves talking and i‚Äôm quiet. I hate phone calls and texting. I struggle to make interesting conversation (especially starting the conversation). And sometimes i even feel like i‚Äôm disregarded when trying to conversate with her. 

After the years of girlfriends and relationships as a teenager, i‚Äôve become solid and find it hard to express my emotions and thoughts. I‚Äôm always worried that i‚Äôll say something that upsets her as i‚Äôm overly absurd and cynical and she can be hyper sensitive at times.

69,canx87,TheSadLov3r,I [19F] don't know how to deal with my boyfriend's [20M] ADHD,"Like the title says, my boyfriend has ADHD and has been on medication for several years, but only takes it when he needs to work. We have been together more than a year, and for the majority of our relationship, there has been a re-occurring problem of him not paying full attention to me, and then me telling him that I don't like to talk when I can't have his full attention. I'm starting to feel like a broken record on repeat at this point. 

Worth noting that he and I are in a long distance relationship, so the only way for us to talk is through a screen. My personality makes it so when someone starts talking to me, I drop everything that I am doing and focus on them. This is how I have always been, and this is how I like other people to talk to me. 

When my boyfriend and I call, I never get his full attention. We watch movies together, play video games together, and other things like that, and I love doing this with him but it doesn't give us a time to really talk as we're both distracted. When I tell him I want to talk, he will start playing his own game or browse reddit or watch YouTube videos. He will then say ""ask me questions"" or just start talking about his game. I am starting to hate doing this, because when I try and talk I get half-assed answers, long pauses after I ask a question, and then sudden interrupts when something happens in a game or video. When I try and talk, for the most part he doesn't even look at me, or he'll constantly glance back and fourth between what he's doing and me.

This is especially hurtful when I'm having a horrible day or am upset, and all I want is to talk to him. A couple days ago he was playing a game while I was on a call with him, and I started crying because I had an awful day. He doesn't stop playing the game, asks if I'm okay, says he's sorry, and continues playing. He made if very clear he wanted to play the game when I answered his call, so I wasn't going to tell him I wanted him to stop and talk to me. He would ask me if I wanted to do anything or talk while still playing, but at that point I felt too numb to talk and said no, keep playing the game. 

As I said above, I have brought this up several times with him, and for the most part he says ""if you want my attention then say so."" But I don't want to have to ask for his attention, I just want to be given it. I don't want to asked if I want to talk, I want to be given a chance to talk. 

I try and put myself in his shoes, but I don't know how to handle this situation anymore. Everytime we call, I just feel awful by the time we hang up. This is driving my anxiety through the roof, and I am so emotionally drained. What can I do?",2019-07-08 17:19:48,3,2,relationship_advice

I mean I think he‚Äôs interested in me, he always ‚Äúso happens‚Äù to take his break the same time as I do, and we both get caught up in our conversations that we end up taking a 30 instead of a 15 (oops). He also ALWAYS sits next to me when we go on break. He  is a really shy guy around others, but seems to have ease when conversing with me! I wanted to see if I could catch him before the shift ended but I missed him! I‚Äôll have to wait until Tuesday (my next shift) to see if he‚Äôs working :// I‚Äôm such a fool!!!! Any tips on how to NOT internally freak out around him? Or better yet, how to smoothly go about this situation? Lmao",2019-07-08 17:19:18,3,5,relationship_advice
71,canwkg,-Bellerose-,He worries too much over me and it‚Äôs affecting our relationship,"Okay, so I‚Äôve been dating my boyfriend for 6 months- long distance. Usually we‚Äôre pretty good but a reoccurring issue keeps popping up and I‚Äôm not sure what to do about it. We‚Äôre both emotionally attached but I‚Äôm not clingy- he is. I don‚Äôt mind but the problem is he worries too much about me and my happiness and keys his insecurities cloud his vision sometimes and every day we have to talk something over. No matter what I say or assure him it doesn‚Äôt seem to he though, like promising him he makes me happy and he‚Äôs fine etc. As much as I love him, it‚Äôs draining to have to go over the same thing every day and he keeps questioning his own worth and it seems I can‚Äôt say the right thing anymore. He prioritizes me over everything else even himself and while it‚Äôs touching it‚Äôs not healthy for his mental state and I‚Äôm not sure what to do.

72,canwbn,RoflexKun,I made a contest with a friend and the prize is a girl,"A little bit of context: 
I'm a 15yo from Romania who will soon begin highschool. I have a friend who is very good at computer science and after the 8th grade exam we started hanging out together more often. But this summer a girl friend of ours introduced us her friend(which is a girl).
So the cast:
My friend: F
The girl: G
Me: Take a wild guest
Common friend: GF

Let's begin:
So we started hanging out with this girl and I felt like I had a crush on her but i didn't know how I felt. One day I was hanging out with my friends with our bycicles(I have a BMX and they have MTB), and our common friend calls us and told us she and G are at some place in the center of the city and that we should go there to hang out together. Because I have a BMX I ride slower so they arrived faster than me and met with the girls.
We hang out there for a bit but we got bored and we decided to go to a park near my house. We hang out there and I tried some new tricks on my new BMX. I am 6'4"" and i ride a XL BMX so its pretty big from the rest of the BMXs so G wanted to ride it and she actually had fun riding it. After some time I have an idea and i told her to hop on my pegs and told her to hold on to me. She is very small about 5'4"" so it was very easy to ride with her in my back. After an half an hour the sister of G called her and told her she could pick her up at the mcdonalds which was far away from where we were. But she hopped on my pegs and we arrivede therw in 15 minutes. Because my house was on a hill I waited for a bus but nothing came so I began to ride on my BMX. It was 11pm and I have received a text message from F and the conversation was something like this
F: Do you like G?
Me: Why?
F: Because I want to try to be with her
Me: And if I say I like her what should happen?
F: We could both try flirting with her and see what happens!
Me: Ok

I arrived home at 12pm and my parents started yelling and me for being late but I parked my BMX and go straight to sleep, but the thought of fighting for a girl kept me awake till 4am and listen to Trevor Daniel.

The next day we hang out without our bycicles but F started flirting with her so baaaad and I'm BAD at flirting. So the I have the next question? Should I invite her to a drink sometime or should I drop out of this ""contest""? If you have another solution please tell me.",2019-07-08 17:17:57,4,0,relationship_advice
73,canvx0,reddit51126,My (40M) wife (39F) thinks she might have an eating disorder. How can I help?,"We've been married for 10+ years and have school aged children. Maybe 9 months ago, she was ill with the flu for a few days, and lost about 5 pounds. She was happy that the scale had a lower number, so she celebrated the loss. Seemed reasonable enough. Since that time, she's begun obsessing about her weight, and has gone from low average to underweight. Her pre-pregnancy weight before our last kid was 117 lbs. (BMI 21.4) and her current weight is around 98 lbs. She lost at least 10 pounds in the last year.   
She doesn't want to eat anything unless its label says it 100 calories or fewer, and she hasn't eaten more than a half-meal from a restaurant in months. She feels the internal struggle, knowing that she *should* eat, but her brain tells her otherwise.  
She has been self-conscious about her body for a while, especially after breastfeeding shrunk her already small breasts into non-existence. When she looks in the mirror, she still sees a fat belly and fat thighs, even though to anyone else, she looks too thin, and has bony prominences that weren't there a few months ago, especially around her shoulders.   
She told me yesterday that she thinks she may need to talk to a professional, and I'm supportive, but when I approached the conversation again today, she's reluctant, thinking she can just grind it out and fix it herself.  
Any advice on what next steps might look like?",2019-07-08 17:17:11,5,3,relationship_advice
74,canvl4,aquacirta,I (27F) snooped on him (31M) and now I don't know what to do,"I'm trying to keep it as short and concise as possible and sorry about the grammar, English is not my native language.

I had a crush on this guy from my workplace (we don't work for the same company but on the same floor). I can't even properly explain why. He's pretty good looking and has cool hobbies (I can't get more specific) but there are a lot of people like that. We interacted once and I ended my previous relationship because I felt I wasn't being honest if I stayed and there were other issues anyways, meaning, I didn't want to stay in my previous relationship if I was thinking about someone else.

Nothing happened with this guy (let's call him Andrew) for 6 months. Then there was a ""networking"" event and we talked again. We started dating, I was super happy, I thought things were going great. We took a three day trip together where I hiked for the first time, he invited me to meet his childhood friends, then his college friends, his high school friends etc. He even thought about bringing me to his family because we were in the area (or so he says at least). He's affectionate and sweet. He kept pushing for us to do things together and spend a lot of time together while I guess I was a bit more withdrawn.I told me it'd been a while since he wanted to spend that much time with someone.

I'm a pretty insecure person. I'm not crazy jealous or anything, but I'm extremely wary and don't give my trust easily. I have a pretty low self esteem but I've always been in good relationships, never been abused or mistreated. I just don't like myself that much because I always think I should be more accomplished than I am. It's a constant struggle but I'm no pushover or anything like that.

Long story short, I snooped on him and went through his phone after three months together (I know, terrible thing to do and breach of trust) and discovered a few upsetting things.

Number 1: He was in a 10 months long relationship before me (Let's call her Lea) which I knew. It started casually on a dating app and it took a long time for them to be ""together"".He claimed he ended it the day after we met. It was not true, more like 10 days afterwards. We met for coffee a couple times around work during those 10 days.

Number 2: He cheated on the previous girl with the girl he was with before (let's call her Megan). He slept again with that girl a few days after him and I met at the networking event. When confronted he claimed sex wasn't that good with Lea and when he ended it with her, he just went back to Megan and it didn't mean anything. He admitted to cheating and that he took the coward's way out instead of just ending things. He said it's the first time it happened. He wrote to one of his friends that she was a nice girl and he couldn't see himself developing the feelings he wanted to develop.

Number 3: He was smitten with a girl from his previous workplace who kept strigging him along. Let's call her Rachel. She apparently was not interested in having a serious committed relationship (in general, not just with him). He kept trying to pursue her to no avail. I found texts from less than a month ago following a party he went to at the previous workplace where he ran into her. The conversation was missing the first part so I didn't get the full meaning. It was hard to understand what they were refering to but it didn't seem romantic or sexual in any way. Just that apparently he asked her a pretty abrupt question or something like that. When confronted he said that he only had bad feelings regarding the situation with her and just wanted to get her out of his system a final time.

We had a few conversations and I told him that it was only three months old, we don't have commitments like marriage or kids, nothing is forcing us to stay together, so if you want to sleep with your ex or pursue another girl, you're free to so and we can all go on our merry way. No need for drama. I told him it's 100% or 0%, nothing in between. He assured me he got them both our of this system and wanted us to work out and that we would focus on building the trust back.

He told me before that I needed to open up more to him (he called me a black box). I know I should do that but I don't want to be vulnerable to someone before I can trust them. It's also hard for me to judge him for the cheating when I did it myself before.

I talked about that to my mom and some of my friends with more details, and they were all pretty chill about it surprisingly. Saying things are not black or white, I should give the relationship a real chance and not ruin it with my mistrust and that what he did was a mistake and he probably understood the lesson. He does talk about future things, he's like to move back abroad for example. When I told him that I can't move as easily as him he said that if we worked out he wouldn't leave without me and we would find a place suitable for both of us. He talks about hobbies we should do together when september comes.

I'm a bit torn and I'm not sure what to do. I guess I need outside perspective. Please let me know if something is unclear or if you need more information in order to give proper advice.

75,canvai,ThisMyOtherAccount69,I‚Äôm back. I made a post back in February about the girl that was messaging her old hookup.,"Take a look at my post history if you are interested. 

Link to old post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aqmrpj/girlfriend_messaging_guy_she_used_to_have_sex_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

Well, turns out she has been messaging him again the past few months. Only now she has stopped since one month ago. 

I caught her and she started off saying that she is sorry etc etc. Now she is saying that is is partially my fault because we were ‚Äúgoing through a rough time.‚Äù She vows to never message him again and says ‚Äúall you can do is trust me.‚Äù 

She says that trying to talk to me is like ‚Äútalking to a vegetable‚Äù but agrees that it was 100% wrong of her to be sexting this guy. 

She said she‚Äôs willing to try to work things out. The main, honest reason I haven‚Äôt cut her off is the fact that our friend circle is intertwined and honestly, I can‚Äôt stand the idea of seeing her with someone else (very unhealthy). Also, for reference, we live in a very tiny town. 

I know they have not met up at all. She does not have a car and has no way of getting to him (he‚Äôs far away).

Edit: added link to old post

Edit 2: she said she cut it off when he began to really push then actually getting together. She only liked talking to him because he was so far away and knew they would not be able to meet up. He does return to school soon which is 2 hours away from where we live.

Edit 3: She really only has been talking to this guy. No others. Even offered to pull up text records",2019-07-08 17:15:54,5,1,relationship_advice
76,canv6u,the_dainty_sea,"I feel like I‚Äôve outgrown my husband, but I would feel selfish and guilty if I left him.","I‚Äôm new to reddit and this will be my first post. I just need some advice or reassurance or maybe just some hard words I need to hear. I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs going to be long and rambly, but I need to get this out. 

I met my husband July 2013. I was 18 and he was 22. It was the summer right after I graduated high school and regardless of me going of to college that fall, we still stayed in touch. When I dropped out 3 short weeks later I moved in with him because I didn‚Äôt have anywhere else to go. He proposed the following February and we married in October. I wanted a longer engagement but my family felt that we were ‚Äúliving in sin‚Äù so to appease them we moved up the date. 

I had a lot of pre-wedding jitters. I was 19 and unsure if I was ready to be married but didn‚Äôt want to hurt him and figured it was normal to feel unsure. 

I figured we would grow together and the issues I had in our relationship would change with time, but he‚Äôs the same person today as he was 6 years ago and it‚Äôs starting to weigh on me. 

A major issue I‚Äôve had with our relationship from about the time we got married is romance has seriously declined. We used to get out of the house and go on dates. We‚Äôd go to the next town over and shop around or go out and eat. But he‚Äôs made the comment a few times that we are married now so he doesn‚Äôt have to pursue me. Y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm a hopeless romantic. I know my ideal of romance might be a bit much, but he rarely says that he thinks I‚Äôm pretty even when I make an extra effort to doll myself up (says that he married me so I should know he thinks I am), we never go on dates because he doesn‚Äôt like eating out or getting out and doing things. And when I finally do get him out of the house he spends the whole time cranky. 

Conversation doesn‚Äôt flow that easy between us because his main answer to my questions is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù or I just get short answers. So it‚Äôs got to the point I don‚Äôt really want to talk to him because he rarely has quality input.

Im 24 and have grown and changed in so many ways since we first met. I‚Äôve overcome crippling social anxiety, some major depressive episodes, learned to love and embrace myself, I‚Äôve graduated with an associates and am currently pursuing a bachelors, and I feel like the person I am today is not at all the person I was 6 years ago. I still fight with my mental health, but I‚Äôm the most confident I‚Äôve ever been. With all my growth, I feel like WE haven‚Äôt ‚Äúgrown together‚Äù like everyone has said we would do as a result of getting married at such a young age. 

We don‚Äôt have any mutual hobbies. He is in a band and spends a lot of time working on his music whether it be going to their weekly Sunday practice or editing stuff at home. But he won‚Äôt put that same time and energy in to me, so I‚Äôve started going and doing things by myself because I am tired of missing out on things I like because he won‚Äôt go. The quality time we have is literally sitting at home on the couch because he has no interest in going and doing things I want to do.

We don‚Äôt have any children. I‚Äôve had ‚Äúbaby fever‚Äù a few times in my adult life, but from a young age I never wanted children. He has said that he would like them someday. So a part of me feels like the longer he is with me, the less time he has to be with someone who can give him children. I‚Äôm pretty set in the fact I don‚Äôt want them so I‚Äôm a little confused why he doesn‚Äôt see this as a deal breaker. I can‚Äôt tell if he thinks I‚Äôll change my mind or he will change his? 

Another thing is that he doesn‚Äôt really pull an equal weight around the house. When we first got together I was happy to cook and clean and grocery shop. It was fun for 18 year old me to be doing the adult things. But I‚Äôve grown into a person who isn‚Äôt happy being a housewife and wants a partner who will pull an equal weight at home. I‚Äôve always worked 20-40 hours a week, on top of going to school, so it‚Äôs not like he works and I sit at home. I work as hard as he does on top of maintaining the home, so he should pull an equal weight.

He has a GOOD heart. He is patient and hardworking, he can make me laugh, and I admire those traits in him. But I feel like I‚Äôve outgrown him in this relationship in so many ways and regardless of talking to him about my qualms, he makes no effort to improve. 

Reading back on this post it seems like it would just be obvious to call it quits. That we‚Äôve outgrown each other and that should be okay. But he doesn‚Äôt have that mindset. He loves me and wants to be with me. I would feel guilty if I left him. He is a little helpless. He can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt cook for himself, grocery shop, or do a majority of the chores around the house. All of his ex‚Äôs have broken up with him and I don‚Äôt want to be another girl who breaks his heart. I just don‚Äôt know what to do.",2019-07-08 17:15:40,5,1,relationship_advice

79,canrpx,Delilah1998,"[20F] Help with my crippling relationship anxiety and negative outlook on ""love""?","I will TRY  to make it short. 

I have GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder). I was on 10 mg of Lexapro for about 3 months, but stopped when I realized it wasn't helping my symptoms whatsoever- as well as killing my appetite completely. 

The areas I struggle with are: Anxiety regarding my future, and romantic relationships.

My mom got pregnant with me completely by accident, after just 3 months of knowing my father. Because he's traditional, they got married when she was 5 months along. Almost immediately after I was born, they started fighting and arguing, and proceeded to divide the house into sections: ""his area"" and ""her area"". 

 Since the divorce 13 years ago, both my parents have been trashing each other constantly. The SLEW of names that my father has called my mum (some of them are horrifying), and even going to far as to claim she should be in JAIL for what a terrible parent she is, have been hammered into my on a daily basis since third grade. 

Both of them have re-married since (my father divorced that lady too) and my mother is stuck with an abusive, unemployed alcoholic who refuses to take care of my little half brother (he's 5). 

To sum it up: My entire family has been divorced multiple times. No one has had a good, healthy, or positive marriage in the slightest. I've noticed what since becoming a young woman, I have been obsessed with the thought that ALL relationships are shit and doomed to end. I see a cute couple on Instagram? My immediate thought is ""can't wait for that to go down in flames"". I see someone I know get engaged? ""When's the divorce"". I am INCAPABLE of being happy for anyone. 

Can you please help me understand why I am so cynical? I feel like an 80-year-old bitter woman who hates everyone and has given up on love entirely..... at 20. 

I have an incredibly negative outlook on ""love"" (which I'm not sure I even believe in at all) and relationships in general. This sub is honestly a perfect example.  I'm not sure what to do.",2019-07-08 17:08:38,6,2,relationship_advice
80,canrnm,ItchyNarwhal,I (34F) am seeking advice on dealing with an overprotective Mother-In-Law (50's),"My Mother-in-law is dead convinced something bad is going to happen to my child (8), unless she personally knows whoever is taking my child. That someone is going to take advantage (make of it what you will) of her grandchild, unless she personally knows who is taking them out and where and until what time. She's been passive aggressively posing about child abductions, murders, rapes, (just anything and everything bad that happens to a child), then asking if I ""saw the story"" she posted. She will then proceed to discuss the story, emphasizing on how you can't trust people.

This isn't new. She's done it on/off since my child was born. But the intensity is. It's like she upped the crazy over the last three months and she's starting to make me paranoid.

I tried explaining that short of dictating every second of our child's life, you cannot protect them against everything. You can only give them the tools they need to try and defend themselves and that is it.

I have no idea how to get through to her that she needs to stop and trust us (the parents).  


Edit: I mean ""taking my child"" as in out to a kid's party, sleep overs, to an outing, etc...  
And yes, she's been paranoid about school field trips, too. She has asked me if there was a way she or I could volunteer to go on the field trip as a parent volunteer. Turns out, yes....if you fill out a form way in advance, take a TB test, and pass a background check (live scan).

82,canppo,97WaterPolo,Girlfriend relationship reoccurring issues,"
Hi everyone,

I need some help with my relationship. I am at my wits end and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve asked friends for advice but not family (explained below) and I figured asking anon over the internet might help. I know in all cases whenever someone explains their side of the story they try to play the victim, when my GF talks to her friends she is told she is right, when I talk to my friends, I am told I am right so I am trying to put everything down as plain as possible to be impartial.

 

I am having a reoccurring argument with my girlfriend about something that I thought was settled a while back and I guess it wasn‚Äôt. So let‚Äôs dive into my mess of a life.

 

GF = Girlfriend, FHM = Female House Mate, RM = Immediate Male Roommate

 

About a year and a half ago I met my GF, we hit things off pretty quickly and things went amazing through the rest of the semester (Fall and Spring) and the next. Towards the end of the Spring semester I was practically staying at school all day and night to do things with her so I decided that having my GF was the tipping point to moving out on my own away from home. I got an apartment and found 3 other roommates (2 bedroom) and this is where this started. My immediate roommate is a guy; in the other room I have a male friend and a female friend. I really wanted to move in with all my friends as we had all grown really close the past year (before I met my GF), and my FHM needed a place to live off campus as it was really expensive and she didn‚Äôt really have anywhere else to turn. My GF and I had been dating for about 4-5months at this point, and my GF and my FHM were friends. When we hung out as groups and did stuff they always got along and talked and I was happy because who wouldn‚Äôt be when your significant other and friends get along. However after my other guy roommates decided to accepted FHM as the last one I told my GF about it, and that basically started our first ever argument.

 

We talked for hours in the car with me reassuring her that there is nothing at all between me and my FHM and that there will never be. I had no other choice for the 4th roommate (originally it was supposed to be temp for FHM to live with us but turned into permanent) and I had to settle it ASAP before we lost the spot at the apartment. I felt bad but I felt at the time that me reassuring her and bringing her over and showing her that she was the one I chose would make things better. Eventually she said in a way that her answer is ‚ÄúNo‚Äù but I can do what I want and she understands but that ‚Äú[She] won‚Äôt be okay with it‚Äù. I guess I took it as the best I was going to get and just moved on.

 

I moved in over the summer (and she went home about ~ 1 hour away) and things were going okay. It was a little rough because we used to see each other every day and to seeing each other for a few days every few weeks was an adjustment but I really enjoyed it because I had my own place and she basically lived with me whenever she came back to the area. Whenever we would just drink and hang out the 5 of us (4 people in Apt. + GF) and play games and stuff and everything was fine. When the Fall semester started it got even better, now that she moved back for school she basically lived with me and was paying rent at another place. She slept over almost every day, we had very similar schedules and we would go out and do a bunch of different things together, wake up and repeat. However at the end of the Fall semester we had our second ever argument which I personally thoroughly believe is her fault.

 

We are both mutually ‚Äúneedy‚Äù in the sense we are always texting or always snapchatting or always communicating somehow. The week before our finals she stayed the weekend and we were studying and such, this is the first time I noticed that she would hide her screen or go to the home page if I looked over at her on her phone. It was the first time she ever had done it so I didn‚Äôt really think anything of it. The next day we went to school to study with friends and she showed me something on her phone and while I was reading it she got a Snapchat notification from someone. I originally thought it was me because for both her and I, we only have emoji‚Äôs after each other‚Äôs names. When I saw it however, it was not me. I just let it go because she has lots of friends and people and I understand that she is an extrovert. Fast forward a few days later when we are studying and stuff the day before our exams I notice that she is hiding her phone whenever I try to have a conversation with her and whenever I catch her by surprise and it starts to annoy me, but I wasn‚Äôt going to say anything with all our friends around so I just put in headphones and went to study. A few hours later she decided she was done studying and said she was going to go home (and I usually walk her to her car), as we were leaving she told me that we lost our heart.  I was confused for a minute because I thought she meant our snapchat streak but she really meant the red heart on snapchat (which I believe is like 3 consecutive days of snapping that person photos the most). When she told me that I was just stopped in my tracks, I asked her if it was the guy who I saw when I was on her phone and she said yes. I asked her who he was and she told me it was her ex-boyfriend from back home. I was devastated mainly because she did NOT tell me I had to find out on my own by seeing a notification on her phone, she said that they were just catching up and talking and stuff but it still really bugged me. I thought I was okay with it, but I wasn‚Äôt. I think it‚Äôs because I know that they have been intimate and have a history that it bugged me so much. She has a lot of guy friends who I know and don‚Äôt know, and it doesn‚Äôt bug me. The only time it truly got to me and hurt was when I found out it was her ex that she was talking to. That led to a huge argument the night before my final which basically ended with a comparison between her situation and my living situation. I was a little rash and hinted that I wanted her to stop talking to him because I don‚Äôt believe you can be ‚Äújust friends‚Äù after you have been intimate with a person. Basically in simple terms I said ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt want you to keep talking to your ex-boyfriend‚Äù, and she started in on how it isn‚Äôt fair or right that I can tell her no and she has to listen but when she tells me ‚ÄúNo‚Äù that I can ignore it.

 

I was confused until she brought up my FHM and I was kind of taken aback because up until that point they had gotten along and everything was going well (My FHM had done her makeup for different occasions, they talked a lot when I got distracted at the apartment, FHM helped me plan my GF birthday party). This night was a blur but it pretty much ended on the fact that I realized I have no right to tell her who she can/can‚Äôt talk to but I just wanted her to know that it made me really uncomfortable and that I trust her but I don‚Äôt trust him. I don‚Äôt believe you hit up your ex ‚Äújust to catch up‚Äù over multiple days and multiple pictures but maybe I am wrong here (my RM agrees with me here). We kind of made up but things were rocky for a few weeks but I guess we both moved on over it.

 

This above thing happened at the end of Fall semester, which means right after was winter break for like 4 weeks. During that time she had winter classes at the school and I was just being lazy, but she basically moved in with me for those 3 weeks. This has by far been my favorite part of our entire relationship, we did everything together, food, activities, binging TV shows, cooking, and just spending lots of time together. My roommate, my FHM, and my other male housemate all went home so we had the place to ourselves and we enjoyed the quality time. Everything was going amazing, even when my roommate and housemates came back for a few days everything was good and cheery and it all worked out well.

 

When Spring semester started, we ran into some issues because our entire school schedule was extremely opposite. She had class when I didn‚Äôt and I had class when she didn‚Äôt, nothing we could‚Äôve done as that‚Äôs the way our schedules played out. We tried to spend as much time out of class together and see each other in-between classes even if it was just for a little. I don‚Äôt know what happened but I guess we just kind of drifted apart at this point because we didn‚Äôt see each other as much as we used too. I often invited her over after classes and stuff but she usually had a reason not to come over. However a key point here, is that I noticed that whenever we did hang out and my FHM was there she would just plain out ignore her and her friends. Not even say hello or acknowledge them, and it kind of annoyed me because I act all ‚Äúfake‚Äù around her friends I don‚Äôt like because I know that they are her friends. I guess I was lonely and annoyed that I couldn‚Äôt see her and spend time with her often as before so I started going out with my friends and roommates and housemates. Specifically my FHM and my Roommate (not that close to my other male housemate) and some interchangeable other friends, we would basically just go out for food a lot of the nights of the week. Come March our schedules finally aligned and after a marathon-like event we went to she came over to spend the night, and then she brought up that the reason why she doesn‚Äôt come over anymore is because of my FHM. She said she doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable and it‚Äôs easier to ignore her because my FHM gets to live with me and she doesn‚Äôt. So instead of seeing her in my apartment it is just easier to not see her at all by not coming over. She said that she couldn‚Äôt do it anymore and that she just wanted a break from my apartment and seeing her (which is why she just ignored my FHM entirely). I have constantly through our entire relationship reminded her that I like her only, and that FHM and I never had anything at all. Basically I apologized for putting her in this situation and agreed to respect her (at the time) temporary break from my apartment.

 

During the rest of March and part of April we just went out and at the end of the day we went our separate ways, she no longer slept over. Things were getting better as we were making more time to spend with each other and it was going well. During Spring break she went off on a camping trip with no cell phone service, so she asked me to keep all of her snapchat streaks alive, including her continuing snapchat streak with her ex. We were finally getting adjusted to our new time table and such so I didn‚Äôt want to start a rift so I said okay and continued her snapchat streaks with myself, her ex, and her other friends. When she got back everything was okay and for a few weeks it was great, but then I noticed she started doing the sketchy stuff with hiding her phone screen or going to home page whenever I talked to her and it brought back bad memories. I asked her about it and she said that she wasn‚Äôt doing it on purpose and that she didn‚Äôt mean anything by it and that she hasn‚Äôt really talked to her ex in weeks she just sends the daily snapchat to keep her streak. It calmed me down at the time but that has and was always festering in the back of my mind.

 

About a month ago I was invited to go and plan a trip to Seattle to visit a friend (there on an internship) with my roommate, my FHM, and 2 other friends from school. My roommate wasn‚Äôt able to go, so it was just going to be the 4 of us going to Seattle, myself, my FHM, and my 2 other friends (whom my GF loves). I stupidly didn‚Äôt tell my GF as 1) We were visiting FHM‚Äôs friend and both of them don‚Äôt like my GF cause she just randomly started acting cold and ignoring them in their eyes 2) I knew she would say no so I just didn‚Äôt ask. I told her after we booked the tickets and stuff and told her that it wasn‚Äôt like a date or anything just a bunch of friends visiting Seattle and enjoying the sights and stuff and she seemed to take it okay. That weekend she went home and kind of just went cold turkey on me so I knew something was up. The Monday after she went home she asked to talk so I went over after work.

 

Me telling her about Seattle and how I‚Äôd be ‚Äúgoing to another state with the one girl [she] doesn‚Äôt like‚Äù brought up a lot of issues and she kind of broke down and talked to all her friends and family. Her family is very religious and didn‚Äôt know that I had a FHM. She let it all out and told them everything and they comforted her and talked her until she was calm. When she got back on Sunday she told her roommates everything, they knew that I had a FHM but they didn‚Äôt know the extent that it bugged her. Her family and friends used to like me and invite me to everything, and now I am not sure what to do to repair and fix those relationships after this. This is one of the reasons I haven‚Äôt asked my parents or my other friends (outside of RM) for advice because I don‚Äôt want to have them alienate her like I feel my GF friend and family are doing to me.

 

Anyways when we talked on Monday she basically said how she doesn‚Äôt deserve to feel this way because of my choices in my living arrangements and she is thinking bad thoughts about me and my FHM (as I am reassuring her) and she doesn‚Äôt want to feel like this anymore. (I am in the lease with my current Apartment for another year until I graduate). She is hurt that I didn‚Äôt invite her to Seattle even though she would‚Äôve said no (I realized I should‚Äôve talked to her before) and she is more hurt that I am going with my FHM to visit my FHM‚Äôs friend even though I have other friends going. The thing is though, I guess I can relate to her and understand because I would be uncomfortable if she went on a trip with other friends and her ex was on the trip, but then I justify it by saying that FHM is not my ex, we were never intimate or anything at all. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd react if she went on a trip with her ‚Äúguy‚Äù friends, I think I‚Äôd be okay if I knew them and such but I wouldn‚Äôt know for sure unless I was put in that situation so I can only speculate it seems.

 

Anyways our conversation on that Monday night leads to the conclusion that she wanted a break until I was back from Seattle. Her definition of a break being no more seeing me just only texting and snapchatting, if that. I was hurt because I didn‚Äôt want a break and I think that it‚Äôs just two letters short so might as well say it. We ended up talking a bit more and I eventually left and we were both sad and left things unresolved. Tuesday/Wednesday all we did was talk and snapchat, though not as deep as we used to. Wednesday night she asked me to come over again and talk on Thursday. I went over Thursday night and we talked it out and I promised to be more attune to her feelings and that after this trip with my FHM I was done with her. I could stand to lose FHM as a friend but I couldn‚Äôt stand to lose my GF over this. I‚Äôd be willing to choose my GF over my friend. My GF means more to me than FHM. Things went well for the rest of the week, we saw each other and spent good quality time, things were getting better I thought.

 

Last week was Fourth of July weekend and my family usually does stuff on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th. I knew she had plans with her family on the 4th so I invited her over on the 3rd and she got a reluctant approval from her parents (cause they aren‚Äôt my biggest fan right now) but there was no way I was able to go from work to her home and back in time for the fireworks so we decided that it would be a next year thing where she has to come over on the 3rd. The 4th and 5th were good, lots of texting and snapchatting of fireworks and such.

 

On Saturday she kind of went ‚Äúdark‚Äù so to speak. Short answers, no emoji‚Äôs, doesn‚Äôt keep conversation going. Same thing happened yesterday, I told her about my day about seeing my family and working on my computer programs and making food and such but she didn‚Äôt really reciprocate. In the evening I asked if I could come over and see her even if it was just for a little and she just asked me what days I am leaving for my trip so I told her and asked why. She ignored the why part and said ‚Äúlets see each other tomorrow‚Äù (aka today July 8th) and that she wanted to talk. I asked her what about and she sent me this essay (though not as long as this post) about how with my trip drawing near today is the last day that she wants to see me until after the trip because it hurts to see me and think about me leaving to another state with FHM and shes going through things at home and work and she doesn‚Äôt want to waste any thought or effort on wondering what I am doing with FHM and that she respected my choice to go so I should respect her choice to not see me.

 

It was late and I acted a little rashly by telling her that I understand where you are coming from but when we come back we NEED to sort our shit out with no Seattle trip because I hate being yo-yo-ed around by thinking that we are okay and then thinking that we aren‚Äôt and now I don‚Äôt know what to think. I ended it by saying that we NEED to decide because I was planning to introduce her to my closest family member the weekend after my Seattle trip (my birthday weekend) and I don't want to introduce her unless she for sure wants to be my long-term (and possible permanent) girlfriend and we work our shit out. I then said that no matter what I am willing to make this work and then went to sleep.

 

Woke up this morning to a message saying that ‚Äú[She] am sorry that YOU chose to go to another state with FHM‚Äù and how that she wants to meet my cousin but that‚Äôs solely up to me now.

 

I guess to sum it up that‚Äôs my entire relationship in 4 thousand works. This is only the bad parts. The amount of good times that we had and new experiences has been amazing and too great to count. I truly love this girl and I think that she could be the one. I know I can‚Äôt actually understand because our roles AREN‚ÄôT reversed, but if I imagine that they are the only thing that would truly make me uncomfortable would be if she went and did things with her ex, the one she had a relationship with and was intimate with and STILL talks to (to what extent I don‚Äôt know). I am also scared that I might be sacrificing friends for her (though FHM is a friend she‚Äôs not that closes as others).

 

We‚Äôve tried to think of a solution to this but I don‚Äôt know if there is one. I can‚Äôt move back home as I have the lease agreement and I honestly really enjoy loving out on my own. I can‚Äôt ‚Äúkick out‚Äù FHM because that isn‚Äôt right and I would feel like a really shitty person, and I can‚Äôt do anything to make my GF feel better even though I countlessly reassure her.

 

I would love some advice from random people around the world on what I should do. I know this sounds heavily favored to my side just  because I am the one who is telling it, but ask me about any part and I will try to clarify it from her perspective because we have talked a lot about all of this.

 

EDIT: She just messaged me that she misses me and even though things are rough she really wants to try and make things work and that if she didn‚Äôt she would‚Äôve ended things when I told her I was moving in with FHM. She said that it was a rough year and she stayed by my side hoping things get better but I have to help her. We both want things to go back to the way they were with our family and friends and us, but that we‚Äôll have to figure something out when I get back. Any solutions on how to fix my relationship, my current future plan was to move in with her after we graduate next year.",2019-07-08 17:04:22,2,1,relationship_advice

85,cano9a,sesentcommelenfer,Is this sketchy ?,"My (23M) and boyfriend (24M) have been dating for a while now, we both have different social media apps except for Reddit. He does not really like me on this app tho, he believes I'll want to talk to other people (I would never, I got Reddit to keep updated on certain things I like such as games) so he gets weird about me having this app so I willingly gave him my account user so he can see what for himself I have nothing to hide but last week I jokingly asked about his account and how I have never gotten it (I don't mind at all honestly) but then he said he was too ""busy"" to give me his user so I, again jokingly said ""You're probably just gonna hide stuff right"" because he was playing PS4, I was with him in the party I know playing Dead By Daylight doesn't affect him ever going on his phone to look at things so I sort of brushed it to the side but had 2nd thoughts about it, he said he would give it to me after Dead By Daylight once he is on the home screen. I know my boyfriend has a history of using Reddit for nudes and porn, which I don't mind but he has directly talked to a couple of guys on here before and although he said he'd, give me his @ I'm yet to have it.

86,canna0,gifujjjjh,Is this a red flag?,"My boyfriend (22m) and I (21f) have been dating for a little over a year. This week I have been visiting him as he is away for a couple of months for work. He is staying in a nice luxury apartment but the rooms are small and he has roommates making it not a completely ideal situation for him I guess? 

This week we fought minimally aside from perhaps some bickering; therefore, I thought we had a great or at least normal week together. Come to find out, he felt the week was good, but told me that he, ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know how anyone can spend this much time together or with any single person‚Äù and how he now needs much needed alone time and that he has subsequently been getting frustrated and annoyed. He then added it could be because of the small ‚Äúdorm‚Äù like room he‚Äôs staying in and the feeling of it being cluttered and that being overall unideal to him‚Äù

After getting that feedback from him this leads me to wonder a bit, is this a red flag and an indication that we won‚Äôt ever be able live together or have an actual long term serious relationship? Or is this just a sign that he‚Äôs less of a ‚Äúpeople person‚Äù and needs more alone time? (Which is completely understandable and fine) 

As silly as it may sound, I‚Äôm worried that if he found a calm, fun, normal, week together  slightly a chore and not a valuable time that he won‚Äôt find any extended time together enjoyable. It leaves me slightly wondering how we are going to eventually move in together after our soon approaching graduation and planned city move next year? Is this an indication I‚Äôm not the right person for him and he won‚Äôt feel this way when he finds the right girl for him? Or is this nothing since we are young and haven‚Äôt been together very long.

87,cann3l,appletreegrowing,I [25F] am unsure how to proceed with him [32M].,"I've been dating this man since summer last year. It was only made official back in spring this year and there was previously a bit of ambiguity about exclusivity before I stipulated that we should be. In the past two months or so things have been a little odd between us. In the whole time I've known him he's made the effort with my friends and social situations only twice, and always has an excuse. This has begun to get quite hurtful and I hate missing out on opportunities with my friends, especially when I always make the effort with his. Sexually he's dropped off almost entirely since I first met him, which has been incredibly frustrating. I've felt quite insecure as a result and (maybe unreasonably) have blown up about it. A week ago we established we probably needed some space from one another, and he actually confessed that he's very unhappy in general at the moment and is trying to fathom finding stability within himself. I backed off and said we'd reconvene this week. Whilst saying this I never intended to consider breaking up with him, these oddities aside he has been a supportive person to me, has welcomed me into his life and has on the whole been a soothing presence. 

&amp;#x200B;

I expect no one in the comments to be ok with this next part. By pure coincidence an ex got in touch with last week, and we actually met up, talked a lot and eventually had sex. I have no intentions of pursuing things with him again - it is clear to us both that we'll never be 'together' again, despite the sex and the meeting being very very good. I'm pondering whether this is indicating I need to break up with the man I'm currently with. My suspicion is that he's been more low than I've realised and I haven't been very sympathetic towards the situation. If this is the case obviously I want to support him and continue forwards, but I believe I may have dashed my chances of that, assuming I tell him. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've yet to reconvene and I don't want to until I've figured out what I need to say. As I see it right now I have two options - break up with him and spare him the information of what I've done OR tell him what has happened, tell him that I don't necessarily want to break up with him (because I do believe I would like to work things through with him), but understand that I've essentially blindsided him and he has reason to walk away. I have no idea how he'll react upon receiving the information of what happened last week - he's always had quite strange opinions about sex and open relationships, but obviously agreed with me about us being exclusive. Any opinions on how to move forward or figure out what the hell I want would help a lot. Please try to refrain from bashing me about the cheating, I'm fully aware of how unacceptable it was.",2019-07-08 16:58:57,4,2,relationship_advice

92,canm12,WiseManSayingNothing,(30M) My high school sweet heart and wife (29F) has informed me that she needs space and time and moved out of our house to think about things and decided if she wants to continue with our relationship.,"We‚Äôve been together for 14 years, been married for 7. We have a 2 year old son and just bought a house. She says she‚Äôs been depressed and got on medicine a few months ago (I think she was prescribed by a nurse practitioner, not a psychiatrist). 

Her reasoning is that she isn‚Äôt in love with me anymore and I haven‚Äôt been supportive enough and I demoralize her sometimes when I criticize her. I can be critical, but I also take criticism very well. She doesn‚Äôt. I feel my criticisms are basic things that are kinda like, hey there is a better way to do that. But I‚Äôve been the same way since we‚Äôve been together. And she decided to marry me after 7 years. Decided to have a child with me after 9 years and just recently wanted to buy a house 4 months ago. 

We‚Äôve always said we wanted two kids, and just as recently as like 5 months ago, she was kinda pushing the subject of getting started on number two. But after telling me of her desire to split, she says one kid is it for her.

The last two years have been a nightmare. We moved back to our hometown and lived with my parents until we could buy a house. It was crowded for 4 adults and child plus several dogs. We did our best to make it work, but it was still tough. Her father died unexpectedly. He was only 40. They had a rough relationship and lead very different lives, but they still loved each other. He reached out to meet our son and she didn‚Äôt reply before his death. Lot of guilt. Then shortly thereafter, my job started giving me shit about letting go of remote workers (which is how we were able to move back), so that kinda added a dark cloud over our heads, knowing I could be let go at really anytime). Then her sister lost custody of her kids. We were still living with my parents at the time, and I did not want to take any in. My wife and my mom kinda made the decision without my full blessing to take one of five in. The kids were split amongst family members. I was very upset. We didn‚Äôt have a room for her, we had a 1 year old. After a week, I came around and honestly feel like I did a decent job of trying to be a good father-figure for her during this time. Tried to be patient. But it wasn‚Äôt working. She was getting suspended from school (she was 10), from after school care and we were running out of options. My mom started hiding knives because we seriously feared she might hurt herself, or our son. One night we reached a breaking point and my wife made the decision to send her to a foster family that had specialized training. That didn‚Äôt work, and she bounced around and finally landed with my wife‚Äôs mom. That also didn‚Äôt work and back to foster care. She has been with one family now for a year. But, my SIL never got her act together, so the kids are up for adoption. My wife has a lot of guilt about that as well. Obviously, I have guilt too. But just my personality is matter-of-fact. We made the most challenging decision of our lives, but it was the right decision. My wife and I also lead very different lives from her immediate family. They don‚Äôt really work and are on government assistance. Siblings in and out of jail for drugs or various other things. She was taken from her parents as a 11 year old and then made the choice to stay with her grandma instead of going back to her parents with her siblings. Think of my wife as Matilda without the magical powers. Just a unnaturally good kid in a rough family. Her family partying and she‚Äôs doing homework. 

But I thought we were just in a rough spot. Like we‚Äôve been through the ringer recently, but now we got our house. Lots of stress from me adding some stuff, like building a fence and a deck. We were just in a general state of stress and despair for some things that happened to us. But I thought we would just kinda stick by each other‚Äôs side until we got through it. Get through the guilt, job security. 

Then she sprung this on me. I was shocked. She‚Äôs told everyone that she doesn‚Äôt know what she wants, and needs space and time. But also has said she doesn‚Äôt feel a connection with me, a person she‚Äôs been with for 15 years and the father of her child. 

Maybe I‚Äôm just holding out hope, but I‚Äôve convinced myself that her depression and medicine she is on is changing her outlook. Maybe not. I‚Äôm just lost, everyone I‚Äôve talked to is also at a loss for what‚Äôs going on. 

I‚Äôve set up a counseling session for us in two weeks, but I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôll be willing to go. 

I‚Äôm like 95% sure there isn‚Äôt another man involved. I just don‚Äôt get it.",2019-07-08 16:56:39,5,1,relationship_advice

She stated she saw how I looked at one of the girls on the trip and stated that we were flirting with each other, which was not the case. I talked her down and we talked about how it was just her insecurities flaring up and walked her through how that wasn‚Äôt the case and how I‚Äôve been spending the majority of the time with her etc... but near the end she states she isn‚Äôt ready for a relationship because of her insecurities and she needs to work on them (a previous bf cheated on her and still messages her randomly like once every few months telling her she‚Äôs shitty and no one will lover her... but that‚Äôs another story)


I told her it takes time to build that trust and get rid of those insecurities but I will work through them with her. Everything is fine again. 


2: I have a group of female friends that I am friends with, I got invited on a trip with them in August (with other guys as well so not just me) and she was asking me if I had a previous relationship with her or I had feelings for her (I was in a relationship with one of them but she is no longer in the friend group) I told her no. 

Fast forward to this past weekend and my friend and I went to Miami for the 4th because his parents just moved there. I had found out a few days before that that group of girls was going to be there too, we ended up pregaming with them one night at another friend‚Äôs place because they ended up at the same pregame. They split off later since they had access to VIP at another bar we weren‚Äôt in on. 

The next day we talked on the phone and I mentioned it to her and that we pregamed with them etc...

Today she accused me of lying, hiding it, and is upset I didn‚Äôt tell her right away that they were gonna be there and tells me she‚Äôs leaving me because she doesn‚Äôt want to be with someone who hides stuff, lies, doesn‚Äôt respect her. I told her I didn‚Äôt even know whether or not we were gonna meet up and that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt tell her initially (the truth) and that I didn‚Äôt lie or try to hide it, I told her the day after. I said fine I messed up, I should‚Äôve told her ASAP.

I ask her not to throw everything away over a mistake like this when I‚Äôve still been honest and I didn‚Äôt lie and do respect her.

She started crying and saying she‚Äôs not ready for a relationship and that she needs to work on herself. I tell her again that I want to work through it with her and help her but she says she has to do it alone and it‚Äôs better for her to leave me now than in a year over the next small thing that comes up because of this and she can‚Äôt work through it with me because all she thinks about is us and she can‚Äôt work on herself like that.

I don‚Äôt want to throw everything away and I want to make this work. Obviously I have insecurities too but I think working through it together will help us both.

Am I being selfish? Should I let her go?
Is there anything I can do to help her and keep her but let her work on herself?

I‚Äôve offered to give her more space etc... but she seems to be shutting down and blaming insecurities/past relationship with abusive partner. I know it‚Äôs a lot but we are great together and I don‚Äôt know what to do. She is on a trip right now and gets back tomorrow but wants time to think and will talk to me in person on Friday.",2019-07-08 16:55:52,5,4,relationship_advice

She's easily flustered, easily angry, and easily frightened, while I don't really react to anything, try to analyze everything as logically as possible, and haven't really been upset in years.

Recently, she's been bringing up my lack of emotions, saying that I need someone to 'open up to' to 'grow my emotions'. I think she thinks I almost don't trust her enough to let my guard down around her or get emotional support from her, but really it's just that I don't need emotional support, and don't really have emotions strong enough that I ever need to react to them. But she just doesn't seem to be able to understand that not everyone feels and needs what she does.

What does she actually want from me?",2019-07-08 16:54:59,0,2,relationship_advice
95,cankf2,boyant24,Am I in a rut/depressed with my relationship.,"Hi Reddit. (Apologies in advance for the long read).

I have been with my partner for 10years this Nov,( I met her when I was 16YO).

We have lived together in her parents house for the last 9.5 years, The last 5 years or so have been tough with each other, she has had issues with depression/anxiety and I have helped her through.

We have a lot of issues with our intimate relationship by way of frequency and adventure, We recently bought a house together (last week) and we both believed this would fix our issues (she promised me things would change as we now didn‚Äôt have to worry about her parents etc).

But now living alone with her I feel as though nothing will change and if anything it‚Äôs gotten worse.

I don‚Äôt wanna leave her but at the same time I can‚Äôt expect to be unhappy all my life, am i in a rut? 

What would you do/suggest?.

I‚Äôve just had enough, I now find my self unmotivated, often sad and stressed and the last few days I‚Äôve been holding back on breaking down, of course I haven‚Äôt told her any of this.",2019-07-08 16:53:24,2,1,relationship_advice
96,canjin,-Takezo-,Conflicted feelings about my year long relationship.,"Just some context before I delve into my insecure bullshit. I‚Äôve never struggled with girls, just relationships. Since getting cheated on by my first gf, I had 2 other failed relationships. My last one sending me into a pit of depressing and hatred for myself. Currently, [21 M] have a steady job, just finished my AA degree, and a great girl who treats me like gold. I guess you could say things are going quite well for me at the moment. 

[2018] So I met this girl at my job through my friend (who worked with me at the time) and really was just trying to get my mind off of my ex. I wasn‚Äôt thinking much of it, I knew I didn‚Äôt want a relationship for a while. I made this very clear with her and she respected how I felt for a few months. Over time though I could tell she was developing real feelings for me and I tried my best to keep at the ‚Äòlet‚Äôs just see where this goes‚Äô stage. To make a long story short because this isn‚Äôt the real issue at hand, her best friend came from out of state and she changed how she was acting so I kind of ghosted her. She tried multiple times to try and hang out and apologize but I cast her out.  We‚Äôre both Hispanic and our tempers are out of control, so we end it in a screaming match and blocking each other‚Äôs numbers. 

A little over a month goes by and I‚Äôm really just trying to focus on myself. Talking to a few different girls really getting comfortable with being alone again. Pride to the side, I really missed this girl and all the great times we had together, the sex, the dynamic of our relationship was so different than I‚Äôve ever had with another girl. So my friends birthday was coming up and he wanted to invite me and the girl from my job because he didn‚Äôt want me to third wheel with his gf there and he didn‚Äôt have any other friends that were girls. We get through the night drinking and smoking, and I start flirting with her but I can tell something was off. By the end of the night we all go our separate ways before she jokingly suggests that I should unblock her number so we can talk. 

To give some insight on why Xanax bothers me so much, my mother was a very serious pill addict and had a number of episodes from when I was young. Caused a lot of resentment between me and her, and basically tore apart any semblance of a relationship with her. To this day, we can barely have a normal conversation.

She tells me she needs to clear the air before we even think about trying to get back to where we were. Which to this day, I respect her for. A lot of women wouldn‚Äôt have the courage to admit her faults. She tells me that she took Xanax and wound up having sex with her best friends ex while she was jail and woke up with a UTI. The more we spoke about it the sicker I got to my stomach. We meet the next day, and I make her rehash the entire encounter cause I‚Äôm a sadistic fuck and idk why I wanted to see her admit it. I regret that to this day. After telling me details I know she probably didn‚Äôt want to share I asked her one final question, ‚Äú Did he wear a condom?‚Äù With the most confidence I‚Äôve ever heard her speak with she told me she looked at him and he just knew and put one on. Which I bought at the time.  Come to find out months later,  she lied and even hooked up with a girl. The magnitude of what she did on top of lying to me about it had me conflicted for a while.

I eventually get over it (I try to convince myself) and we come back stronger than ever. We basically agree that we‚Äôre in a relationship because I never formally asked her out. And toward the end of the year her best friend goes on a rant online about it and he replies how great it was.  

[Present day] I don‚Äôt understand why something that happened a year ago still bothers me from time to time. She‚Äôs a great girl and I‚Äôve really helped her grow as an individual, I have endless love for her as well. But moments after we‚Äôre done with sex, it will just pop up in my head. I look at her next to me some nights and there‚Äôs no one I‚Äôd rather be spending my prime years with. Then there‚Äôs other times where I wonder if I‚Äôve just spent a year with this girl who loves me worlds more than I love her and one day I won‚Äôt have it anymore. I‚Äôve treated girls bad in the past and I don‚Äôt want to make that mistake with her. 

To sum it up, I guess my issue is that I don‚Äôt want to lose her but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be ok with this shit popping up in my head sometimes. It really fucks with my mood and my perception of her. Any type of advice would be very much appreciated.",2019-07-08 16:51:27,1,1,relationship_advice
97,caniou,quesomonstruo,After a falling out my sister in law told the family I'm aggressive and insinuated I might do something to my baby.,"Sorry if this is all over. I wrote it on my phone over the course of a day and tried to put it into some sort of readable order. Main bit and a shorted backstory is below if you don't want to listen to my ramblings.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*BACK BACKSTORY\*\*

Three wives of brothers have had babies within 2 months of each other. I'm the youngest of the wives and the only first time mum. Whenever I would talk about pregnancy or the babies in the baby whatsapp group, no matter how many times I said ""generally speaking"", ""the majority"" or ""has a tendency"", Wife 1 would get angry and go on a tirade about how it doesn't apply to her and give me an anecdote about herself or a friend.

&amp;#x200B;

This came up with birth position (I wanted to be upright as it's supposed to be better, she argued she had a perfectly fine birth on her back), vaccines (one of the pregnancy ones wasn't that big a deal and her/her friends didn't have that one and it was fine) and feeding (when talking to Wife 2 about us both breastfeeding I said breastfed babies have a tendency to be underfed v bottle fed babies who can be overfed. She was angry saying this wasn't always the case (in hindsight now, her son is overweight. I should have had more awareness perhaps)) among other things.

&amp;#x200B;

When this kept happening I stopped talking in the group, only popping in occasionally. She messaged me saying we have different styles but asked me to come back to the group. I specifically said ""If you have given an example of how it didn't apply to one person you understand why I can't just ignore the fact that it applies to 99%? I'm not brushing it off obviously. It's just added to the list if the first option doesn't work."" We agreed our styles are different but one isn't better than the other. So I came back in.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever there was a kickoff like this I didn't say anything to anyone. I don't think it's right to talk about someone who can't defend themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*BACKSTORY CONTINUED\*\*

Last week I was talking about my separation anxiety about leaving my 4 month old with her grandparents because I know she won't be as happy there (she is inconsolable at times whereas she never cries at home). I made a point to apply this to our specific situation so it couldn't be misconstrued. I said she's unhappy with anyone else because we've not had her spend time with other people.

&amp;#x200B;

Right here was when Wife 1 said I should let her stay out because she knows someone who was parenting like I am and her one year old is startled easily, cries and cries for her, hides away and struggles to calm down. I'd like to point out that I have NEVER said anything about her parenting specifically like she had done here. Never said anything about the potential consequences of her style of parenting. Never told her her way was wrong and she should do this way instead because its better. Never. Because there isn't a right and a wrong way (other than the actual wrong ways, obviously).

I said my little one been so unhappy with colic and reflux I just don't want to be adding to that distress.

&amp;#x200B;

Her reply number one came with ""babies love their grandparents, aunties and uncles"". I said there's no emotional attachment at that age. I realised what I said and how it might upset her so tried to backtrack. I suggested that it applies to us and it's our fault because we don't let her spend enough time with people.

&amp;#x200B;

Second came after the distress comment. She said her first was so ill he had colic, reflux, was on oxygen, she thought he could die etc. And she had to leave him at times (he was in hospital for the first 8 months of his life). I pointed out that they can't really be compared. I assumed this was obvious!

&amp;#x200B;

She kicked off. Really kicked off and left the group.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll preface the next part by saying I swear/curse. I've joked that I'm getting it all out now before she gets old enough to pick it up and I have to stop. I shouldn't, but I do. I'm also very open. If i'm frustrated I won't hide it because, in my eyes, its normal and healthy. If you need to hide it and think its not normal, you have a problem. Maybe I'm crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*MAIN STORY\*\*

My mother in law (who I love like a mum) came over a couple days later because she ""was worried and everyone just wants to help"". I didn't really get it but I appreciated her nonetheless. But I found out Wife 1 told people that I said she overfeeds her baby and he's dangerously overweight, I said her son doesn't love his grandparents, I said my baby only loves me no one else not even her dad, I said my problems with little one are as bad as her very ill first born. She also said I swore at my baby when out for lunch last week with both Wife 1 &amp; 2 and I was being aggressive. The insinuation was that I might do something. (Interesting how the threat of danger against a baby was only worth mentioning over a week later after a disagreement). In not talking to people about her previously, as she has done, there is an entirely one-sided misrepresentation of me among the family. It's painted as she's been trying to help all this time and I've used her as a punching bag to take out my PND (which we don't think I actually have, I'm just exhausted) on her.

&amp;#x200B;

I stayed home and cried as my husband went over and explained some of the situation to his parents who understand I'm not a danger to our baby. So that's good /s  Nothing has been said to the brothers as it is generally agreed I'm not dangerous but the other stuff...

&amp;#x200B;

I can't defend myself because in doing so I will cause a massive rift in the family. It'll come across bitter and there's no way of knowing whether they'll even believe me. I'll then be the one dragging things up and exploding. If I show the messages to support what I'm saying/defend myself it might look like a character assassination. I would still come out looking malicious. And once I start with the retaliation, I'm worried I won't stop. The relationship with Wife 1 and quite possibly her husband, would be irreparable. Long term, me being upset is better than her being upset because (once I get over this feeling right now) I can play nice for the sake of the family I love. I'm not sure she can.

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am. This feeling of all the brothers and wives thinking these things lingers over me. Even the small stuff still hurts too. Suggesting that I am the sort of person to attack someone and their child for no reason. She's playing the victim and painting me as a bad person and bad mother and I don't feel I can do anything about it. I'm sure this isn't the first time she's said things about me so I don't know how reinforced this idea is in people's minds. I've never said anything about her. Most of all, them thinking that I am a danger to little one, even for just a moment, even if they don't think it anymore, is devastating.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband says his family loves me, no one thinks bad of me but it doesn't matter anyway because I shouldn't care what people think. Me him and little one are all who matter.

But I do care.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if you‚Äôve had to read all this. I guess I just wanted to get it off my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any advice that can be given on the situation itself but maybe someone can help me to not think about this and feel sad.",2019-07-08 16:49:36,3,1,relationship_advice
98,canhj3,throwawayaccountt567,I‚Äôm tired of helping my little sister with her phone anxiety. Should I be more understanding?,"This is not my main account (throwaway) because my little sister goes on Reddit as well. 

My little sister is 21 years old and ever since she‚Äôs been diagnosed with depression (18), she claims she has phone anxiety (i believe her) and she‚Äôs not as aggressive on the phone. She can‚Äôt call customer service, go to a store and buy/talk to a cashier, or do anything without my help. She can‚Äôt even send an email because she‚Äôs too scared. 

I‚Äôm all for helping family, but now I‚Äôm so sick of it. She can‚Äôt do anything on her own.It‚Äôs been two years and I have to do everything for her - call in to make appointments for college/doctors appointment, go with her to appointments, returning stuff to a store, etc. She recently asked me to call this place to get a refund back about some coupon and she postpone it for almost 6 months because of her phone anxiety. I‚Äôm tired of helping her because I have to deal with my problems. 

I discussed it with my parents and they said, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not mentally stable and she needs help. What‚Äôs wrong with helping family?‚Äù and I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of it and I have a life. I‚Äôm not her mom and she‚Äôs not going to learn anything if I keep doing it for her.‚Äù I told her she needs to figure out a way to deal with her phone anxiety because I won‚Äôt be here forever to watch over her. She told my parents and they told me ‚Äúto be more understanding‚Äù and I ‚Äúshould be helping family.‚Äù 

Should I be more understanding? I have a life and I feel as if I‚Äôm enabling her to rely on me. My parents can‚Äôt help her because they speak very little English. 

tl;dr: my little sister has phone anxiety and depression. I‚Äôve been calling in for her for appointments and going everywhere so she feels more at ease. I‚Äôm sick of it and I have a life on my own.

Almost as soon as it ended, unintentionally, I got into another relationship. Yes a rebound, but we‚Äôve been dating for almost 5 months now. The problem with that, is I associate him with my ex, because initially I was trying to use him as a distraction to get over my ex, but I guess that never happened. My ex has a girlfriend, and they‚Äôve been together for about 5 months as well. Anyway, the other night when I went out clubbing, I saw him. Neither of our SO‚Äôs were there. I was with my best friend, and we both took MD so I was super friendly and nice, even though I probably should‚Äôve been cold to my ex, seeing he broke my heart. By the way, this was the first time we‚Äôd talked after the breakup. He could‚Äôve left us, but he didn‚Äôt. He bought us shots, and was overall super fun. I am still in love with him, and we were flirting, but even rolling I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to cheat. Plus, hooking up out of the blue when we‚Äôre both fucked up doesn‚Äôt count as a win for me. Now, I‚Äôm just more confused than EVER!! I feel the same way as I did when it first happened. Sad, lonely and longing to see him. We ended the night being great friends, and I think I‚Äôm okay with that, cause I just want to be around him. Only problem is his girl is insaaane and hates me, even though we‚Äôve never met. So, obviously we could never hang out. I‚Äôm just sad and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Clearly, there‚Äôs nothing I can do, but I just want some advice.

101,canh7u,danmerchantw,Hooked on a past Ex ? Do i move on or do i confront the feelings that are still left.,"So a bit of background, i was with my ex for over 2 years, she‚Äôs my type in every way possible we had a lot in common and got on amazingly. The relationship took a turn when she was losing interest in me, i later found out from her that she‚Äôd been talking to her ex from just before me and she went straight from me to her, he hadn‚Äôt changed was still controlling and very hurtful to her so she then started coming back to me, in the meantime I‚Äôd started talking to someone new because i was so down (Yes like a rebound) i went back and forth between talking to both girls, eventually sleeping with my ex which i told the new girl. My ex then said she didn‚Äôt want anything to so with me and we couldn‚Äôt be friends so i worked on making it up to my new girl. After a few weeks my ex then starts messaging me again whilst I‚Äôve managed to get my new girl to trust me and allow a relationship to carry on, finally March this year my ex and i had stopped messaging full stop and I‚Äôve continued a relationship steadily with my new girl.

I‚Äôve gone out to Oz with her to travel and waited 6 months while she travelled asia with a friend, she has extreme trust issues against me (which i understand) but she does doubt whether she‚Äôll ever trust me so the relationship does have some hardships at times where we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs best to do.

Now this entire time I haven‚Äôt spoken to my ex but i check her social media channels on a weekly basis, when i see her around driving i get sad, she is just stuck in my mind and I don‚Äôt know what to do, I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs in a new relationship but i have found her following me randomly on social media late at night but then unfollowing me the next day so i guess she still keeps tabs on me ? 

I do enjoy the time when I‚Äôm with my current girlfriend but when she isn‚Äôt around it makes me doubt the relationship, she‚Äôs moving to the city in a few months for a year long course and then potentially working there so I think that‚Äôll strain the relationship?

I‚Äôm just looking to see if anyone has had the same issues before, having your mind occuped for an ex over a year later even though you‚Äôre now in a stable new relationship, i admit i am a bad person yes but from previous history and experiences I know i have to think of my own feelings and mental health to get what is right in my mind.

102,canh1o,minetteee,My boyfriend either cheated or catfished.,"This is a continuation from a post I made before (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c91hjk/my_boyfriend_19m_and_i_18f_havent_been_the_same/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) but this isn‚Äôt totally necessary to read. To summarise: long distance boyfriend, grieving the deaths of 3 people close to him pushed me away. I eventually decided to tell him that I loved him but I wouldn‚Äôt speak to him if he didn‚Äôt reply to my final message as I would take that to mean he wasn‚Äôt interested in talking for the time being . 

To present day: I found out only around 2 days later that he had blocked me on all his Instagram after reading what I had said to him. Upon looking at his profiles, I saw that he was dating a girl that I knew.. an old friend, let‚Äôs call her ‚ÄúL‚Äù. He had told me in the past she was a lesbian and that I had nothing to worry about. All the same, I was angry about this and messaged him on an account he HADNT blocked me about, saying: ‚ÄúL, huh? You have the right to move on, but I wish you hadn‚Äôt been so cruel and swift about it when you know how this whole situation has made me feel.‚Äù
he replied in seconds and, he denied it. ‚ÄúL? No?‚Äù  
I showed screenshots of her name in hearts on his bio (this is the ONLY thing I had to go off). This is where it gets weird: he revealed to me: ‚ÄúL has been me from the beginning‚Äù and showed me that he does, in fact, have access to her Instagram account, 
He said he hadn‚Äôt cheated on me and that one day he would explain. The whole conversation he was abrasive, kept telling me to be quiet when I pushed for more explanation and said that he would talk to me in the future but that he didn‚Äôt want to right now. I‚Äôm left in a spiral of emotions. All evidence points to L being a real person; she has a Facebook account and interacts with his mother on comment sections, etc. He either cheated on me, or he did this for attention. The evidence mostly seems to point towards him cheating.

I know how ridiculously stupid this all is. The obvious answer is that he‚Äôs moved on, and I should too. I just can‚Äôt help thinking back to when he was a nicer and better person, before he was mourning. But the way he speaks to me now, I see almost no traces of that person. I‚Äôm heartbroken; and overall, confused. He told me he doesn‚Äôt want everything to be over and that he‚Äôs being truthful with me, but in the same conversation he tells me to be quiet, that he can‚Äôt talk to me right now, and that I‚Äôll only have answers if I ‚Äúshut up‚Äù. 

He was different before all these deaths, and perhaps with time he will get better. So; do I cut him off entirely and never see him again, or keep my options open and give him the benefit of the doubt? 

I know what the obvious answer is here, but I‚Äôm confused and I need reassurance on what the right decision is.",2019-07-08 16:46:10,10,1,relationship_advice
103,canh1f,znate7,How to not be as obsessed with my long term relationship,"I'm (17m) in a long distance relationship for the summer with my girlfriend (15f) and I'm very needy when it comes to communication. My problem is I want to text her a lot, having conversations throughout the day, like I had with my last girlfriend. I also feel like I've become a little obsessed with her, thinking about her throughout the day. And I also get insecure sometimes when we do talk, I get jealous, resentful, etc. but I've never shown any of this to her because I don't want her to think I feel those things, as there's no reason for it. Maybe a better subreddit would be self-improvement or something, because the problem really is with me as I doubt she thinks anything is wrong. 

I want to overcome my obsession and insecurity so I'm not dependent on her and so I don't care about her taking a long time to text back.

The thing is, when I‚Äôm over at his house, he doesn‚Äôt want us to eat dinner with them, and would rather have dinner with me in his bedroom (even though I‚Äôm the one that has to make the effort to talk to them). When he comes to my house (not very often) he will get very anxious towards 6-7pm because he knows my parents will invite him for dinner if he stays longer. I find it very obnoxious because no one is forcing him, he can just say ‚Äúsorry, I have to go back for X reason‚Äù but he would rather just avoid the invitation altogether. He has stayed over for dinner one time (I put my life into convincing him) and everything went well, but he feels he‚Äôs very socially awkward. 

I know I can‚Äôt force him, but we‚Äôve been together for a long time now and it‚Äôs a deal breaker for me. 

I‚Äôve talked to him about this but he can‚Äôt seem to change. What should I do?",2019-07-08 16:45:37,2,1,relationship_advice
105,cangop,dastardlywong,"Too woo, or not to woo.","Hey, Reddit. I need some help for this one.

I‚Äôve recently developed feelings for a coworker I‚Äôve been friends with for about five months. We hung out outside of work once several months ago. It wasn‚Äôt bad, but it was awkward. We barely knew each other at that point. Since then, however, we‚Äôve grown closer as friends. We trust each other enough to talk about deeply personal feelings and events. And there are little things that make me wonder if she‚Äôs interested in being more than friends.

Here‚Äôs my dilemma: How do I pursue her? I‚Äôve never had a problem attracting women, but I have shitty game. How do I tell her how I feel without outright saying how I feel (which never works for me)?

Edit: If all you‚Äôre going to say is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt date your coworkers,‚Äù then take your witty wisdom to another post. I know it‚Äôs a risk, and I‚Äôve considered it. I trust us both to be adults if it doesn‚Äôt work out.",2019-07-08 16:45:20,3,1,relationship_advice
106,cangfm,defenestrateawayyy,Long distance boyfriend [35] of several years hasn't had a job since high school.,"I met my boyfriend online and we've been in a relationship for a few years. He lives in another country so this long distance is taking a toll on our relationship. I'm planning on moving to his country, but to get a job there (I'm a teacher), I learned that I have to have a masters degree. So I've been busting ass, trying to get accepted for an MBA program here. My boyfriend on the other hand hasn't had a job since his high school years. He's working on a trade that he picked up about 1 or 2 years ago. He tries to teach himself the tricks of the trade by watching youtube videos. Last year he had told me that a place that deals with his particular trade had an opening and that he was going to apply for it once winter was over. Summer came and he told me that he has crohn's disease (self diagnosed) and that working at that place would be too difficult. I urged him to go to a doctor, see if they could get the symptoms under control but he claims that because he has social anxiety disorder it's too difficult for him to go to a doctor. He hates hospitals in general. To his credit, he really does have crippling social anxiety.

So since he won't work in a company, he wants to get really good at what he does before he starts monetizing his trade. Today I asked him what his goal was. I wanted a time frame of when he would start making money. He said it depends on how fast his skills improve. He told me that ""best laid plans sometimes don't pan out and that he has learned to be flexible and still enjoy what life offers."" He told me that I asked about his plans right when he had made a big breakthrough in his progress and that I probably didn't even notice it. I had in fact noticed, and I had complimented him for it. I said I had noticed ""x"" and that he had done it without the tools needed, so it was an accomplishment. The word I used for ""x"" apparently was the wrong word since I don't know much of the terminology in his trade. He made fun of me for using that word. He went on to say that I should do my MBA for myself, not for our future and that even without the required degree I could find another job once I moved over there. I guess he was feeling pressured. At this point, I was crestfallen because it felt like my efforts weren't being appreciated. In a moment of heat, I admit, I said ok I'll just cancel my application for the program. 

He hit me with this line: ""I'm not about being taken care of and having it lorded over me in an eternal guilt trip."" I was shocked cause I actually want him to contribute to our future, together, as equals. That was my whole point.

I need another perspective here. Was I in the wrong for pressuring him to start monetizing his trade? We need to make enough money to be able to live comfortably. I don't want to take that risk and fly over to his country without knowing how we will be able to get by. It's been several years already and I'm 30 years old. I want to start a family and I keep getting reminded that my biological clock is ticking. How could I have worded my request so as to not come across as guilt tripping him?",2019-07-08 16:44:49,15,1,relationship_advice
107,canfjk,hi_misteroctopus,I've (22F) developed feelings for somebody else (27M) even though I'm in a LDR (22M) - looking for any advice/thoughts,"It's a long story but basically I've (22F) been in love with my bf (22M) since we were neighbors in middle school. He's someone I easily see having an amazing life and beautiful babies with but unfortunately he now lives in Australia and I live in the US. After high school we broke up because I was moving away to go to college and I didn't want to be in a relationship cause I knew it would be close to impossible. I obviously thought about him all throughout, and no one I dated seemed to make me as happy as him. A year after I graduated he took a trip throughout the US and spent about a week and a half with me. We had the most amazing time, we went to a Broadway show, went hiking, went on a ski trip with all my friends, he told me he loved me and I told him I never stopped loving him. I could not let go of him. We decided to go long distance and this is where I am now - we've been in a LDR for 4 months and I have a flight booked in November to go see him.

About 6 months ago I met someone (27M) who we'll call Ted, made me laugh and is so crazy about me. He asked me out on a date when I first met him (before I was dating my current bf) and while I really enjoyed our time, I didn't feel a spark so I said we should just start as friends and see where it goes. Our friendship continued progressing until I realized I developed feelings for him. I was at a bar and two girls hit on Ted, our other friend came up to me and asked me if I was jealous, I said no but I realized I was. He's not someone I would normally date so I hadn't realized the full extent of my feelings.

This last weekend for July 4th, our group of friends took a camping trip and Ted was invited. There was a lot of drinking involved and we got ridiculously close. I know exactly what he's thinking before he says it. We have the same sense of humor and he makes me laugh constantly. Physically, he'd occasionally rub my back or, if we were sitting next to each other he would play with my hand underneath the table where no one could see. I loved it. But obviously felt guilty as well. Is this cheating?

Anyways, after the trip I texted him: ""I understand we have a special connection. But I need space to get my head together and figure out what I should do. Please don't text me for a while (even though i'm seeing him on friday because we're all going to a concert) If we were to potentially start something, I'd hate for it to be under these conditions.""

He was really understanding and offered to not go to the concert.

I'm completely clueless because I know that if I don't continue to pursue my relationship with my bf, i'll regret it for the rest of my life but also he's so ridiculously far and what are the chances we'll make the move. I'm confused. Any advice or thoughts are very much appreciated.",2019-07-08 16:42:57,4,1,relationship_advice
108,canf3j,saltath,I'm (21F) considering an LDR with a guy (24M) who wants to resolve past issues to make things work. Is it worth a shot?,"TL;DR: I cut things off with a guy who we both felt insane potential in, because he showed a lot of problem behaviors I didn't want in a relationship partner. He just graduated and starts a new degree program across the country, and we're talking about a LDR. He attributes a lot of the fucked up things he did to the stress and poor mental health of the admissions process, and seems very devoted to addressing past issues to make this relationship work. He's flying over later this month so we can hang out and see how things go, but given everything that's happened, I'm not sure if should just call the trip off.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Last fall, I (21F) started casually seeing a classmate (24M) who I had a fantastic connection and great chemistry with. There are lots about his personality that I really like, and things just feel right. 

Unfortunately, I also saw a lot of behaviors I didn't want in a serious partner. He had told other classmates that we were seeing each other, and once he realized that I preferred privacy, he lied that he didn't tell anyone before confessing to the truth. He was also pointlessly argumentative at times, pushy and demanding about my time, and he had issues with alcohol. So barring a relationship, I only wanted to see him casually, but he said he doesn't ""do casual dating,"" so I broke things off. Drunkenly, he calls me something cruel and obscene but that I ""deserve better."" I cut off all contact with him until late May.

A few days before he flies out, we go on a few dates and things go really well. The whole time he was here, his mental and physical health were severely strained -- much of the problems stemming from stress and alcohol -- but now that his future is secure, he's quit drinking altogether and improving his health. \*But\* he also tells me that, as a part of the messed up shit he did during his destructive period, he hooked up with a classmate (23F) who was in a committed relationship with her live-in boyfriend for 3 years; he instigated it knowing that she was uncertain about their relationship, they hooked up, and her relationship was broken as a result. While this isn't as damning as cheating on his own relationship, it comes pretty close, and this tremendously wavers my trust and respect for him. Thinking about what he did actually kind of repulses me.

Sooo he and I are thinking about a long-distance relationship (lmao), which seems ridiculous since he and I are both a transition period in our lives, and because his past behaviors towards me give me a lot of pause. I am basically banking on his past behaviors being a contingent fact of the stress he was under, and that I need to see demonstrated change before starting a serious LDR. 

I have talked about all of this with him, and he's very very understanding that I'm unsure about this, and he thinks the situation is pretty damning for him too, from my perspective. He plans to fly here later this July, but I'm not sure if I'm crazy for even still considering this, considering all that's happened. (Can people change really all that much?) Should I give this a shot?

110,cane2d,M0909,Me (30F) and my boyfriend (47M)- Doesn't want me to get anymore tattoos.,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been pretty torn up about this.

Long story short, met my bf last year who knew I had several tattoos (I have 11 currently, mostly all on my arms and they're palm size or larger) and he was aware I wanted more. I have been pretty open about this that I do not plan on stopping until my arms are finished. He has somewhat voiced he's not a fan of tattoos, but hasn't made a big deal otherwise. 

I told him recently that I was planning on finishing my left arm in the next few months. We got into a heated discussion because he said that ""I do not value his opinion that he thinks I should wait and I should care how he feels because I'm his partner""- I expressed that it's my body and how I choose to express myself, to me, does warrant such a reaction or to basically accuse me of not valuing our relationship because I want tattoos and I expressed that it feels controlling (ie there are several other things that could be more detrimental- such as if I went out every weekend and drank excessively and didn't make time for him to be in my life, lying, cheating, are other serious fundamental things that would show disrespect to our relationship and him, which has not happened btw) we agreed to disagree at that point and moved on and have been fine since.

We have been dating since March, and I recently got a new tattoo. He was ""disappointed""; his exact words. I immediately got upset, reactionary, and told him I felt it was really shallow at this point (we have said I love you, we talk about possibly having children together,) to show a discontentment over this, when has knows that I want to do this, and if he really can't accept me, then we need to just break up because I am not going to change my interests/passions/something that I want for myself, over someone just because they don't like them, especially if it's something that does not hurt him or myself. 

He listened, but also felt that I wasn't listening to how he feels about them; which to be honest, I don't really understand. He basically told me that they bring attention and he cares how someone carries themselves? But I am a good, honest, caring, loving person, regardless if I have tattoos or not? I think it has more to do with that other people don't like them and I will be judged and they carry a negative connotation (antiquated ideas that tattoos mean you're lower class, impulsive, a drug dealer, etc). For reference, I cover at work, have a professional job, and am aware of the implications that people can and do judge and I use discretion in certain environments to cover/not cover them.

We left off on OK terms, basically again, agreed to disagree, and he made a joke he wants it in writing that I won't be getting any more after I finished my arms, but I don't know if it's sweeping things under the rug.

I've never experienced this from a partner (all of my partners have never voiced that they don't like them or tell me I should care about their opinion over this--), and I don't know how to process this essentially. 

Thank you for your time.",2019-07-08 16:39:40,9,1,relationship_advice
111,candz6,tacoburrito21,I (24F) think my bf (26M) might be in love with someone else," Bf (26M) and I (24F) have been together for almost eight years, living together for 2. We usually have a lot of friends coming over to stay with us bec our apartment is very accessible within the city.

Today my college friend went over to stay for the night because of a job interview the next morning, we were having dinner and reminiscing about our college experiences (we all went to the same college) when the topic of past loves came up. My friend said she was having a hard time finding a new partner because of a recent break-up she had, saying that he was the love of her life.

My bf replied with, ""That's normal, even when you're in a really happy relationship, there's always this one person who is the love of your life even if you can't be with them.""

My friend laughed and looked at me because I looked really weirded out by what he said. I have been struggling with self-esteem issues since the beginning of our relationship so I would say I was uncomfortable with what he said, and now I'm overthinking that maybe he's still longing for this girl he courted before I came to his life.

I don't know if I should open this up to him, or how to react. I know that if I ask him, he would completely deny being hung up on this person. However if I don't, I'll continue to overthink what he said. I'm afraid I'll be opening a can of worms if I open this up. Not sure what I should do?

I'm there for him and I help him a lot, which makes him tell me he doesn't know what he'd do without me and that he doesn't deserve me. 
He keeps falling in this self-hatred cycle every two days or so. Last time he even asked me what my deal was, cause he couldn't understand why I'd be with him. 

He told me he loved me once when he was really drunk, but I didn't count that.
I don't know what to do. I feel like the ""I don't deserve you"" talk means that he wants me to leave. I've told him this and he insists that he wants us to be together, he's just sad that he can't give me as much as I deserve. 

I'm completely lost. I like him a lot, sometimes I even think I love him but everything is just so dramatic and ambiguous for no reason. I just feel empty and tired all the time. I don't know what to do.",2019-07-08 16:39:00,9,1,relationship_advice

I‚Äôm 19 my girl is 20. We have been together since March of 2018. Early in the relationship, I was going through a new anxiety disorder thing and it resulted in me having some problems down there. One time she was giving me oral, when I went soft. 

Fast forward a couple months, and I ask her why she hasn‚Äôt been giving me any oral sex. At this point in time, she told me that she was scared of that happening again and we talked about it. She said she understands and would try to not let it stop her. So that was cool.

Fast forward another couple of months, she‚Äôs only given me head 1 other time. So I asked her about it. She said she has no problem sucking dick (for lack of a better term) and used to do it to her ex regularly.

So I just want to say that in terms of giving her oral sex, I do that almost every day besides when it‚Äôs her time of the month. I try not to hold it against her but I just wanted to note it before someone says well you probably never give her oral.

So it‚Äôs been over a year, and I asked her again. Her response this time was ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt really think about going out of my way to do that, it‚Äôs not that I try not to.‚Äù. So here I am kind of lost. Not sure if I would be an asshole if brought this up yet again to her.

115,canca0,jmickk84,My roommate is illegally renting out our storage room as a bedroom??,"A few weeks ago my roommate decided to sublet her room for the month of July and stay at home to be closer to work. Everything was finalized, she found a girl to sublet, and she was getting ready to move her stuff in. However, the very same week that the sublet‚Äôs other apartment lease was ending, my roommate changed her mind. For basically no reason. (If you‚Äôre curious, this is what led her to change her mind: Last week she decided to reconnect with an old guy she used to talk to, who is now dating someone else, and talking to him has NEVER gone well. I asked what her intentions were and she said they were just friends hanging out at a bar, lol. Unsurprisingly to no one they ended up making out, he cheated on his gf but refused to break up with her, and it got messy. This triggered a big emotional response from her and she decided she  needed to stay in her apartment to be closer to her friends and support.)

So flash back to two weeks ago, the sublet has been texting my roommate for nearly 2 days, asking when she can pick up the keys, move her stuff in, etc. I tell my roommate she obviously has to tell the girl asap that she‚Äôs actually staying, since the poor girl barely has any time to figure out a backup plan. However, since it‚Äôs summer there‚Äôs a lot of friends we know that are also subletting their rooms, so I offered to help my roommate find a different room for the girl to sublet so she wouldn‚Äôt be completely screwed over. It would be last minute, but we definitely would still have time to find this girl a room at a different apartment, right? 

Wrong! My roommate still wanted to make a quick few hundred bucks from this girl, so she offered to let her live in our storage room. Yes. Instead of a nice bedroom with windows and a private bathroom that she thought she was getting, this girl was now essentially being offered a cellar. It doesn‚Äôt even have a window, it‚Äôs cold and dark in there, it doesn‚Äôt reach our wifi router, and it‚Äôs just terrible. But because this girl essentially had no other option, she accepted the offer to live in our cellar, and my roommate made her pay $500 for the month, which I thought was ridiculous. She only split it with me, despite the fact that there‚Äôs a total of 4 girls on our lease, because they‚Äôre not here that much and don‚Äôt even realize there‚Äôs a girl living in the storage room. 

So I feel terrible for this girl, and my roommate is genuinely being an asshole about it. She‚Äôll send me screenshots of the  girl asking if there‚Äôs other sleeping arrangements because she‚Äôs uncomfortable from the bugs in her room, asking if there‚Äôs a wifi router extension so she can connect to the wifi, etc, and my roommate is literally just like ‚ÄúUgh she‚Äôs so fucking annoying‚Äù. Meanwhile my roommate is just staying her room like always, and I really don‚Äôt understand why she decided to sublet it in the first place.  

The problem is that the girl is now asking if we can have the landlord come by and spray her room for bugs, and they‚Äôll obviously see that we have an extra person living in our apartment that isn‚Äôt on the lease. The room isn‚Äôt considered a bedroom. The obvious answer, at least to me, is to have my roommate move back home for the rest of the month like she originally planned to, but that‚Äôs out of the question for her. I was never the biggest fan of her to begin with but in my opinion she‚Äôs been absolutely horrible to this girl. I don‚Äôt know how to attach pictures but the screenshots she sends me are ridiculous, the girl will literally text my roommate asking a simple basic question or request and my roommate will freak out and send it to me acting like this girl is so demanding and difficult. 

Is having this girl living in our storage room even legal? I don‚Äôt think it is since she‚Äôs not on our lease and not staying in a real bedroom. It genuinely really bothers me to know that this girl has to sleep in that room every night. I‚Äôm very non confrontational and usually just agree with my friend to avoid problems, but in this case I try to stick up for the girl. I‚Äôm always like, I think it‚Äôs the room that‚Äôs the problem, not the sublet... but my roommate isn‚Äôt having any of it. She‚Äôs honestly just acting really heartless about it. Is there anything I can even do at this point to help the sublet? Otherwise she just has to tough it out until the end of the month and she‚Äôs clearly already struggling, as anyone would be. I‚Äôm definitely not living with my roommate anymore after our lease is over, and this incident has only confirmed that I made the right decision",2019-07-08 16:35:42,5,3,relationship_advice
116,canc22,ohfuckzap,Wife [31/F] moved us [30/M] for her ‚Äúcareer‚Äù but vastly over-sold the job. Now we‚Äôre moving again and I‚Äôm furious. Trust issues.,"My wife and I are in very different professional fields. We met at a graduate student mixer that was designed to ‚Äòcatalyze‚Äô industry and academic partnerships. In our case, we fell in love. My wife is a passionate researcher and worked hard on her PhD in the social sciences. I graduated from a combined MBA program and almost immediately found work. Things were going great until she graduated and it became clear the academic market was worse than she had believed and she was receiving no call backs, no interest in jobs. She was teaching here and there, mostly one-off contracts. She was making next to nothing and was spending more than she earned going to conferences, working as an independent scholars and trying to connect to the right people. I funded all of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, she landed a post-doc in her hometown (Montreal) telling me that it was a pathway to a tenure track job, etc. (point of reference, we were living in the US at the time). How it was explained to me was this: They would have a tenure-track opening in one year and that she would do this post-doc and then transition directly onto that role. She was elated. I was not. After a lot of discussion we agreed to go. Finding a job in Montreal was not easy. I don‚Äôt speak much French and the job market isn‚Äôt really geared for what I do. I got many rejections, a lot of ‚Äúimprove your French!‚Äù and even a ‚Äúhide your graduate degree!‚Äù but no job. After about 8 months, I finally landed something, making less than 1/3rd of what I made before. The job I have requires me to travel frequently back to the States, so I keep a lot of my industry contacts up, but I otherwise hate the job, the people I work for and the industry. I took it to pay bills and that was that.

&amp;#x200B;

I was doing it because I knew how hard my wife worked on her dissertation and how hard academic jobs are. About 4 weeks ago my wife approaches me about my career opportunities and wondered if it was just better if we returned to the US. She was very nondescript and instead of saying why she was saying this, she just continued to wonder aloud. After prodding, she just said very prosaically that she wants to leave Montreal. I was floored. I had spent 8 months slogging to find even a shitty job and she‚Äôs suddenly done with academia? Then she hit me with the truth: the post-doc is ending and her tenure-track job is nowhere on the horizon. The department now says they can only hire for this role closer to spring 2022 and they aren‚Äôt sure that they‚Äôll have the funding even then and that budgets are stretched. She knew around Christmas that the department wasn't in a position to hire anyone. The department chair emailed her an apology saying they know there was a vague promise, but there‚Äôs nothing she can do, so the post-doc ends in August. My wife showed me the email and then to add insult to injury, she admitted she is not as happy as she thought she‚Äôd be, as most of her friends and colleagues have left the area, and we‚Äôre relatively alone in a city earning less than we did with absolutely no real outlook for future growth. Her contract is up in August and we‚Äôre now stuck. We have a ton of work to do but I‚Äôm stuck being furious. I am constantly angry. 

&amp;#x200B;

I made a lot of sacrifices for my wife who has been less than forthright. She said that she was deceptive because she kept hoping against hope that things would change or the budget would work out. She didn't know how to break it to me that it wasn't going to happen. I'm so angry for being deceived and just fed up. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can I move past this? Every time I have to start looking for work again, I get angrier and it ruins the day. My wife has been really sheepish and avoiding the topic recently, which also really angers me. I'm a mess and need advice.",2019-07-08 16:35:14,9,19,relationship_advice
117,canbv3,Slyffer6,Friend and love interests.,"This is my first time posting here but I'm just looking for someone to help give me ideas on what to do.

Well basically it all starts with me and a friend (Jay*) of mine matching with the same girl on tinder. I start talking to her about nothing serious but we end up chatting and adding each other on Facebook. A few weeks pass and more talking and I end up meeting up with her for a coffee. We seem to get along pretty well and I end up dropping her home feeling pretty good about it all.

That weekend Jay and I go to a pub to see a band and we later get kicked out since Jay got too drunk. On our way back this girl invited us to a party. One thing leads to another and me and this girl get an uber back to mine and hook up.

I continue seeing this girl both for casual hook ups and small dates here and there. Nothing too serious. I later realised that I'm growing feelings for this girl and I talk to Jay and a few others about it since she's the first girl I've been interested in since getting out of a long term relationship. I say I'm interested but I don't want to rush things and just go slowly.

Fast forward a few more weeks and a few more dates all three of us attend a party together. The whole night the girl seemed very distant from me but I didn't think much of it. After a night of heavy drinking I wake up to Jay and this girl making out in which I pretend not to notice then make an excuse and leave. I felt completely betrayed by both of them but I just put it behind me.

Tonight after going out again with this girl I told her how I felt about her and how I'm interested. She seemed taken aback and didn't say much as she left the car.

I get home and text Jay and tell him what happens in which he replies with something along the lines of him and this girl are seeing each other and he thought I was joking when I said that I liked her. Jay apologiesed and I later messaged the girl asking what happened.

She said she thought we were just friends with benifits since when I first met her I said ""I don't know if I want a relationship or not"".

I'm just wondering what to do, I feel so betrayed by my friend and this girl. I don't know if I can talk to my friend again without feeling rage.

Can someone please help.",2019-07-08 16:34:46,2,1,relationship_advice
118,canbib,lkshdowls,Any advice on how to make my tutor (m22) like me (f16)?,"I am 16, he is 22. I like him, i mean idk how to explain it, he is just cute yet sexy, he is mature but not old, he is strong and a man not a boy. I always liked older guys.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently with a guy, he is also 16. I dont like him, he just kept confessing to me that he loves me and i agreed to give him a **chance.** We have been dating for 1 month. I like my tutor for like a year.

&amp;#x200B;

So, yesterday. My tutor was in my room trying to help me with studies. I wanted to confess to him yesterday, i dressed up and wore the most attractive/sexy clothes, i put perfume and stuff.  I complimented him, i was like ''i like your smile, you look hot and cute when you smile''. I know i suck at flirting. I also asked him if he likes younger girls. He didnt say anything and ignored me. He broke my heart kind of.

&amp;#x200B;

Before he left, He told me you are a child and that guys my age will like to be with me and that my bf loves me a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice. I mean what should i do now?

&amp;#x200B;

By the way, its legal. I can date him because i reached 16 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: He is my fathers friend son, thats how he became my tutor, My father asked him to tutor me. so again..... its legal.

119,canbbc,quesomonstruo,After a falling out my sister in law (32F second time mum) told the family I'm aggressive and she worries about me (26F first time mum) doing something to my baby.,"Sorry if this is all over. I wrote it on my phone over the course of a day and tried to put it into some sort of readable order. Main bit and a shorted backstory is below if you don't to listen to my ramblings.

**BACK BACKSTORY**


Three wives of brothers have had babies within 2 months of each other. I'm the youngest of the wives and the only first time mum. Whenever I would talk about pregnancy or the babies, no matter how many times I said ""generally speaking"", ""the majority"" or ""has a tendency"", Wife 1 would get angry and go on a tirade about how it doesn't apply to her and give me an anecdote about herself or a friend.   


This came up with birth position (I wanted to be upright as its supposed to be better, she argued she had a perfectly fine birth on her back), vaccines (one of the pregnancy ones wasn't that big a deal and her/her friends didn't have that one and it was fine) and feeding (when talking to Wife 2 about us both breastfeeding I said breastfed babies have tendency to be underfed v bottle fed babies who can be overfed. She was angry saying this wasn't always the case (in hindsight now, her son is overweight. I should have had more awareness perhaps)) among other things.   


When this kept happening I stopped talking in the group, only popping in occasionally. She messaged me saying we have different styles but asked me to come back to the group. I specifically said ""If you have given an example of how it didn't apply to one person you understand why I can't just ignore the fact that it applies to 99%? I'm not brushing it off obviously. It's just added to the list for if the first option doesn't work."" We agreed our styles are different but one isn't better than the other. So I came back in.   


Whenever there was a kickoff like this I didn't say anything to anyone. I don't think it's right to talk about someone who can't defend themselves.


**BACKSTORY CONTINUED** 


Last week I was talking about my separation anxiety about leaving my 4 month old with her grandparents because I know she won't be as happy there (she is inconsolable at times whereas she never cries at home). I made a point to apply this to our specific situation so it couldn't be misconstrued. I said she's unhappy with anyone else because we've not had her spend time with other people.   


Right here was when Wife 1 said I should let her stay out because she knows someone who was parenting like I am and her one year old is startled easily, cries and cries for her, hides away and struggles to calm down. I'd like to point out that I have NEVER said anything about her parenting specifically like she had done here. Never said anything about the potential consequences of her style of parenting. Never told her her way was wrong and she should do this way instead because its better. Never. Because there isn't a right and wrong way (other than the actual wrong ways, obviously).  


I said my little one been so unhappy with colic and reflux I just don't want to be adding to that distress.   


Her reply number one came with ""babies love their grandparents aunties and uncles"". I said there's no emotional attachment at that age. I realised what I said and how it might upset her so tried to backtrack. I suggested that it applies to us and it's our fault because we don't let her spend enough time with people.  


Second came after the distress comment. She said her first was so ill he had colic, reflux, was on oxygen, she thought he could die etc. And she had to leave him at times (he was in hospital for the first 8 months of his life). I pointed out that they can't really be compared. I assumed this was obvious!   


She kicked off. Really kicked off. Said I'm taking my PND out on everyone who is trying to help. This was a blow in the gut as I'd only recently opened up to everyone about the fact I was finding being a new mum hard. I still don't understand what I did to be considered to be taking anything out on her. I said I can listen to advice but not taking it isn't a slight on anyone. I think she stopped reading at this point and left the group.   


I'll preface the next part by saying I swear/curse. I've joked that I'm getting it all out now before she gets old enough to pick it up and I have to stop. I shouldn't, but I do. I'm also very open. If i'm frustrated I won't hide it because, in my eyes, its normal and healthy. If you need to hide it and think its not normal, you have a problem. Maybe I'm crazy.  

**MAIN STORY**  


My mother in law (who I love like a mum) came over a couple days later because she ""was worried and everyone just wants to help"". I didn't really get it but I appreciated her nonetheless. But I found out Wife 1 told people that I said she overfeeds her baby and he's dangerously overweight, I said her son doesn't love his grandparents, I said my baby only loves me no one else not even her dad, I said my problems with little one are as bad as her very ill first born. She also said I swore at my baby when out for lunch last week with both Wife 1 &amp; 2 and I was being aggressive. The insinuation was that I might do something. (Interesting how the threat of danger against a baby was only worth mentioning over a week later after a disagreement). In not talking to people about her previously, as she has done, there is an entirely one-sided misrepresentation of me among the family. It's painted as she's been trying to help all this time and I've used her as a punching bag to take out my PND (which we don't think I actually have, I'm just exhausted) on her.  


I stayed home and cried as my husband went over and explained some of the situation to his parents who understand I'm not a danger to our baby. So that's good /s  But nothing has been said to the brothers.


I can't defend myself because in doing so I will cause a massive rift in the family. It'll come across bitter and there's no way of knowing whether they'll even believe me. I'll then be the one dragging things up and exploding. If I show the messages to support what I'm saying/defend myself it might look like a character assassination. I would still come out looking malicious. And once I start with the retaliation, I'm worried I won't stop. The relationship with Wife 1 and quite possibly her husband, would be irreparable. Long term, me being upset is better than her being upset because (once I get over this feeling right now) I can play nice for the sake of the family I love. I'm not sure she can.   


So here I am. This feeling of all the brothers and wives thinking these things lingers over me. Even the small stuff still hurts too. Suggesting that I am the sort of person to attack someone and their child for no reason. She's playing victim and painting me as a bad person and bad mother and I don't feel I can do anything about it. I'm sure this isn't the first time she's said things about me so I don't know how reinforced this idea is in peoples minds. I've never said anything about her. Most of all, them thinking that I am a danger to little one, even for just a moment, even if they don't think it anymore, is devastating.  


My husband says his family love me, no one thinks bad of me but it doesn't matter anyway because I shouldn't care what people think. Me him and little one are all who matter.  


But I do care.

Sorry if you've had to read all this. I'm just upset and wanted to get it off my chest more than anything. I don't think there is any advice I can get to fix this but maybe advice to stop me feeling sad?",2019-07-08 16:33:36,5,0,relationship_advice

Fast forward to today, and I'm still gushing over how I'd like to decorate and all that and he just replies with a dry ""okay. "" I ask him what's the matter and he says that this is all I keep talking about and it's getting old. How can someone say that about planning the future? He says that he is as excited as me, but he would rather talk about something else because planning the future sounds boring. I express my disappointment and he replies with ""it just won't be much of a conversation with me, I'll help if needed but I'll be bored the whole time.

I don't even know what to say to him. I just feel sick and sad. How can he think planning our life together is boring? It's the most important thing we could do!

Ended up really close with each other for a year, met up later, she professed her love to me first (I was planning on asking her out that evening), and had a great 7 month long LDR, meeting up four more times.

Until she broke things off last week due to ""age difference"" (which I really do not believe since we had no problems at all). Even more, she said she had a talk with her older (31F) sister about me, and that's when she said ""I started to like you less after the talk"". Me and her sister has NEVER met before, so I don't know what she could have said to my ex AND have my ex believe what she said was true. I can't help but feel sabotaged. Should I talk to her about this, or give it a few weeks and then try to reconnect with her? I still have major feelings, and I know her feelings too, so I feel we could have another chance but at the same time, if she trusts her sister's unsupported rants more than me, I should be happy.",2019-07-08 16:32:54,1,1,relationship_advice
123,cana3o,throwaway111qqq,Alcohol in a relationship,"I was raped a long time ago and alcohol played a major role. I find now that I cant mix alcohol and sex and almost always dislike it when i partners are drinking or smell of alcohol. My current partner has depression and plethora or other problems so drinkingisnt our only disagreement and i think this relationship is pretty much over. 

My question is for future relationships or dating in general what can do to deal with this. I dont mind my partner drinking on occasion. once in 2 week for instance. But I cant deal with the amount my current partner drinks(he also tries to push my sexual boundaries when he gets a little buzzed). I have been given the following advice in the past. 

1. Dont date. Just stay single 
2. Only date people who have extreme aversion to alcohol (not a big dating pool though)
3. It my problem, so dont expect a partner to reduce drinking to make yourself feel better aka get used to being around rape triggers. Basically just deal. ( this person told me she cries into a pillow when it get to much for her but after that she is fine.)

126,can85f,notgreatateconomics,My (16M) sister (21F) had an argument with my Mom (47F) about me,"Last May my Sister graduated from a 3 year course; even getting a cum laude in the process. This graduation ceremony took place about 2 days after my results came out (disappointing).

I was bummed and quite gloomy about my results cause they weren't too satisfying and it really sucked cause of the amount of effort I put into my studies. 

I was obviously down but extremely happy for my Sister and her achievement whereas my Mom thought that I was in competition with my Sister, for reasons undisclosed. I love my Sister and all that she's done for me, I never thought the academics would be a competition but my Mom decided so.

My family normally has this practice of posting a lousy Instagram posts about each other once in a while; and this graduation was definitely seemed like it deserved one of those. My Mom decided that she wouldn't post one since it seemed quite irrelevant at the time (illogical as hell). My sister was quite hurt by the fact that my Mom didn't post anything for her grad and she decided to confront my mom about it. My Mom retaliated and simply put it as, ""I'm not in the mood"". Me, in a my Sister's side, kept on asking for a proper reason but she never gave any concrete explanation as to why the appreciation post didn't exist.

Fast-forward 2 months, just a general dinner and the topic rises again. Why? Because my Sister posted a series of the family and her friends. My mom erupts about it and snarkily remarks, ""So you finally decided to post it?"", In a very unappreciated manner (keep in mind my mom hasn't posted anything **still**). This in my opinion, was a little over the top and my Sister broke down, making her food salty and a Mom still defended herself with, ""I wasn't in the mindset to do so"". My sister constantly brought up that she thought that my mom wasn't proud of her own daughter to tell her friends that her own blood has gone out done SO MUCH for herself. 

Truth behold, Mom decided that the post was to be ignored since I wasn't in a good mood cause of my ""success"" and that I would feel ""jealous"" (I couldn't care less about my grades cause what's been done can't be reversed)

127,can77v,rela_adthrow,Marriage on the rocks,"So I‚Äôm using a throwaway because I have friends and family who frequent this sub and I‚Äôd rather them not find my regular commenting account. 

My (27F) husband (30M) are having probably the biggest fight we‚Äôve ever had. It‚Äôs a very long story so I‚Äôm gonna try my best to condense as best as possible. 

I‚Äôve been on him over the last couple weeks to spend time with me and the kids. He works a lot, I admire that and I‚Äôm very grateful for it because we‚Äôre the type of poor where we can‚Äôt afford for both of us to work since daycare is too expensive for an infant. When he‚Äôs working I don‚Äôt bother him about his time because I‚Äôm not unreasonable. But when he‚Äôs off I want him to spend some time with us because the kids are young and miss him. The only time he‚Äôs interested in spending time together is when his kids from his previous marriage are at our house, it‚Äôs like he has to put on a show so his ex wife can hear about how fun he is. Other than that, he‚Äôd prefer to stay up until 5AM playing Apex and sleep until 1PM while I‚Äôm doing everything with the kids, setting up play dates, taking them places and giving them experiences. Every picture I post on social media is either just me and my two girls or the entire family including his two kids. If his kids aren‚Äôt here, I‚Äôm out with the girls while he‚Äôs at home playing video games. 

When I try to talk to him about it he says he‚Äôs tired cause he works a lot or he says that his depression is at a low point and he doesn‚Äôt wanna do anything but stay in bed. I get being tired but you can‚Äôt be that tired if you‚Äôre staying up for up to 24 hours playing Apex. To clarify, I‚Äôm not a naggy wife in anyway. It‚Äôs one thing he loves about being with me. But now I wonder if he‚Äôs loved that about me because it allowed him to do whatever he wanted without consequences. 

Anyways, things came to a head last week because on Wednesday I asked him to come to the library with us for an hour since he was up and didn‚Äôt have to work until the mid afternoon. He snapped at me and basically said to leave him alone and stop asking him to do stuff. Then he backtracked and said he‚Äôs been really depressed and his boss let him come in late because he‚Äôs struggling to find the motivation to get up. I also suffer from depression, so I understood how he felt and told him it was fine and we‚Äôd get through it but in the meantime try not to neglect his family. When I‚Äôm depressed and slacking on housework and cooking, he always tells me I need to pray about it because there‚Äôs no excuse and I need to be a mom or whatever. I wouldn‚Äôt tell him the same thing he tells me because his words aren‚Äôt comforting. 

Anyways, he came home from work that night and said he‚Äôs going golfing with his friend in the morning, that was to be Fourth of July. I took no issue with him going golfing in the morning. I was a little annoyed that he‚Äôs too depressed for his family but just fine for his friends but didn‚Äôt say anything. The morning comes and he doesn‚Äôt go golfing so I assumed he wasn‚Äôt going.  At noon he hops up and gets dressed saying he‚Äôs leaving to go to the golf course. I told him I‚Äôd rather him not go because it‚Äôs noon on Fourth of July and we had plans to cook out with our neighbors. We should be finalizing plans for grilling and fireworks not getting ready to leave to go golf. He went anyways and didn‚Äôt come back until 5:30. No cook out happened. I was pissed and didn‚Äôt speak to him when he came home. We went to go see fireworks with the kids that night but it was tense because the issue hadn‚Äôt been discussed and I was still upset. He didn‚Äôt like that I was still upset because when issues like this happen he likes to act like nothing happened and ignore it. He wanted me to let it go and move on and I wasn‚Äôt willing to do that without talking about it. That made him mad. 

He ended up coming to bed at 5:20 the next morning cause he stayed up all night playing Apex and woke up at noon. The whole house slept in that morning after being out pass their bedtime watching fireworks, the kids and I woke up at 11:30 and I‚Äôd served them breakfast, put coffee on to brew, and sat down to scroll on Reddit when he got up. As soon as he walked out of the bedroom he starts talking shit and picking a fight about how I‚Äôm so lazy and all I do is sit my phone all day and the house is a mess. Then he demanded that I go clean the mess in the kitchen that HE made the day before. The fight escalated and voices raised. I told him I was leaving and taking the kids to my mom‚Äôs house for the day because I‚Äôm not dealing with him. He grabbed the baby and insisted I wasn‚Äôt taking her, going on about how women always wanna take his kids from him. I told him I would call the police if he didn‚Äôt give me the baby to leave. He basically egged me on and dared me to do it. So I did. 

Now bear in mind, we‚Äôre in the middle of a custody dispute with his ex wife. So I did something that resulted in a police report that his ex wife‚Äôs lawyer can find if he decides to look for it and he‚Äôs worried that this will show that our home is unstable and he‚Äôll lose. Our home isn‚Äôt unstable aside from this incident. We‚Äôre just regular people under a lot of stress from the custody battle and everything else I‚Äôve talked about so far. Now this is blown up because it‚Äôs like he has his ‚Äúthing‚Äù that he can latch on to to twist a fight that started because of his actions and say that it‚Äôs all my fault and I screwed everything up. I know I was wrong to call the police, I reacted in anger and didn‚Äôt think about the ramifications and I‚Äôve apologized for it. But he doesn‚Äôt want my apology because he says I still have an ‚Äúattitude‚Äù about everything else. I told him I can be sorry for doing what I did and still be mad at his actions, the two aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive. I feel like he‚Äôs doing what he‚Äôs done in the past where he wants me to take the full blame for our fight so he doesn‚Äôt have to take responsibility for his actions. He‚Äôs gonna hold it over my head for months and throw it in my face. He wants me to assume all the blame for this fight and absolve him from all responsibility because I called the police in order to leave the house with my baby. I‚Äôm not doing that. I‚Äôm sorry for what I did and he has no remorse for his actions that escalated it to that point. He also wants to play the pity card and keeps saying things like ‚Äúever since I told you I was depressed you‚Äôve been mad at me, I guess it‚Äôs my fault for having feelings‚Äù. 

We tried to talk things through yesterday and he reduced it to name calling and shit talking and throwing things I‚Äôve previously told him in my face. He said a lot of hurtful things. My oldest daughter was the result of a sexual assault and he said that if we divorce and I take custody of the baby then it‚Äôll two men‚Äôs lives that I‚Äôve ruined with lies. I tried to explain to him how I‚Äôve felt about his lack of attention to the kids and our marriage and he taunted me and called me names. He didn‚Äôt wanna talk, he just wanted to hurl insults and argue. He says he‚Äôs reconsidering our marriage because I was stupid enough to possibly cost him the custody case. I told him I was reconsidering our marriage because of how disrespectful he is to me, how little effort he puts toward his family, and how he‚Äôs always manipulating every disagreement to make himself the victim. I held out and just took it for awhile but as soon as I started talking shit back at him all of a sudden he says we need to talk like adults. I told him I don‚Äôt have anything else to say to him if he won‚Äôt be reasonable and rational, if he insists on being disrespectful and hurtful then there‚Äôs no marriage to save cause I‚Äôm through with arguing and getting nowhere. 

I‚Äôm hurt and angry. He‚Äôs slept on the couch since Friday night and we‚Äôve barely spoken to each other. I don‚Äôt know what to do. He won‚Äôt see reason. All he wants is for me to say ‚Äúeverything is my fault and I shouldn‚Äôt have been mad that you went golfing‚Äù and I won‚Äôt say that because the problem is deeper than golfing and he knows that. He just wants me to feel crazy by saying ‚Äúall this over golfing?‚Äù over and over. 

Please help me.

128,can6tq,Dry_Echo,I'm (31m) a loner and it has my GF (26f) worried.,"Some backstory, I was in 2 serious relationships before, 5 and 3 years respectively.  Both of those didn't end well.  After the last one ended I had a pretty tough time with it, took me about 2 years to get over her.  Then my Mother became ill (she'd been battling cancer on and off for about 15 years) and ended up passing away.  After the last breakup and my Mother passing I pretty much secluded myself from friends, they'd ask for me to hang out or go out and I would maybe 1 out of 5 times.  I had the mindset that I needed to work on myself after the breakup and I really think that I did, but I had not been in a relationship with anyone for 8 years til my current girlfriend, there was various hookups and dates that I thought would fill the void but nothing meaningful.

Fast forward to this past winter.  I was in another state for work for 4 months and I met this girl through work that I was extremely interested in, even though at this point I was still a bit cautious because I didn't want to feel the way I felt after my last relationship ended.  I ended up going for it, we hit it off and started being an official couple after dating for about a month.  Things were great, I ended up going back home after the 4 months and we had talked about how it would be hard but we were both willing to work on it because we thought our relationship was something special.

The first couple months were pretty good, she is 4 hours away and both of us have visited eachother.  She works 6 days a week and I work 7 days a week with an occasional day off, so the visits were only for 24-48 hours usually.  The last month or so has been shaky.  We haven't been able to see eachother as much because I've been out of town 3 out of the last 5 weekends.  Here comes the loner part that is creating a problem.  This weekend we were together for a couple days and she told me about something not involving me that was stressing her out and ""making her feel uncomfortable in her own skin"", she didn't want to have sex or be very intimate other than normal kisses.  This is completely fine with me, I understand I have a higher libido than her and I'm ok with that.  I asked her if that was the only thing that was bothering her because she seemed like she needed to vent still.  It wasn't.  She told me she feels like our communication hasn't been great, which she is right, there's times on the phone where we go 3-5 minutes without really saying ANYTHING.  It bothers me and obviously it bothers her, thing is, I don't really know what to say.  I usually work early, 5:30am - 12:am and then sometimes in the afternoon.  I don't have much to talk about other than my day at work, which she enjoys because she's in the same industry.  She is someone that does stuff with friends almost everyday or she does gardening/spending time with her pets/etc.  She also is into Salsa dancing, I can't dance at all and I've considered taking lessons, but I have this feeling I will embarrass her, I've told her about this and she reassures me that she won't be, but the feeling still remains.  She goes out once or twice a month with a couple friends and does this, when I was there she asked me to go but I declined because of what I mentioned, I hadn't told her that at that point but I wanted her to go out and enjoy herself, I told her I thought I would feel out of place because I'd have no idea what I was doing and didn't want to be a drag.  So because of this she feels like she has to carry our conversations and she really has, once it gets past how my day at work was.  Then she expressed she's been a little worried about when I eventually move to be with her, we've talked about how if we're still together when it gets a couple months away from when I'd need to relocate for work, we'd like to close the gap.  She doesn't want to go out and do things with her friends and feel like she's doing something wrong because I am alone, I'm perfectly fine if I am and I told her that but she is still worried about.

Basically I'm wondering what I can do, I want to make this work.  I'm not much for making friends, which is one of her major concerns when/if I do eventually move, she said it's going to be stressful if she's feeling like she is the only one I have there.  I've already talked to a friend about doing something this week on his day off and plan on spending some more time with my 2 roommates.  This is partially to improve our communication and she has made me realize that I've been in a rut socially.  Any advice?

Sorry this is really long and kind of all over the place, I'm pretty stressed at the moment.",2019-07-08 16:23:44,0,1,relationship_advice
129,can6l4,throwawayFdOQpqZ,"My (31M) girlfriend (26F) has been having sexually explicit, flirtatious conversations with a coworker","If this were something as cut and dry as physical infidelity I would have a pretty clear path ahead of me, but I am feeling very confused by some things I've recently uncovered. My girlfriend and I have been together for over 2 years, and she recently started a new job about a month ago. Ever since our sexual chemistry, and even just our general affection chemistry, has seemed a bit off.

I chalked it up to her being a bit stressed at the new job, she went from working part time to full time and it was a bit of an adjustment that I thought would pass.

This brings me to the 4th of July. There was a small party, and she invited some of her work friends. During the party, certain things happened that I thought were pretty weird - she was paying more attention to a guy from her new job than me. I'm not the kind of person who demands to be the center of attention by any means, but it was like I was invisible at moments. Two of my friends in attendance approached me afterwards asking me if everything was okay between my girlfriend and I, and they gave me their two cents on the situation - that it 'pissed them off' to see her doing that in front of me, and to 'watch out' for her.

I confronted her about this, and she owned up to being selfish. Part of her just wanted to interact with her friends and be a good host, and another part of her wanted to see if I would intervene. I will admit I don't ooze masculine energy like a lot of other men do when it comes to relationships - and it's been a bit of a problem when it comes to my and her chemistry.

Rewind to early in our relationship - she was prepared to jump ship because she thought my lack of overt, explicit advances was a sign of me being disinterested. At this time she was working at another job, but started to develop feelings for a coworker who was saying the sorts of things she needed to hear. He had a girlfriend, and workplace gossip got back to her, and he shut the whole thing down. I was blind to it all until months later when she told me what had happened. I forgave her, and chalked it up to our love languages being different. She told me that I didn't do the things she was used to having in a relationship, but after going through that she realized those are things she could live without and that I do 'so much more' that those other things.

Fast forward to yesterday. I'd dropped the whole 4th of July thing, and was driving with her when she, thinking aloud, was wondering how to delete messages off her phone. I didn't really think anything of it in the moment, but after I got home later, and she was heading out again for a Sunday side-gig, it seemed a bit strange to me that she was wanting to delete messages.

I'm ashamed to admit that my impulses got the better of me. Her computer was sitting there open, so I went on an opened a browser to her Facebook page. I looked at a message that she had just received from the same guy at work she had at the 4th of July party - and it was nothing. Their message history was pretty blank, only a few professional things, but nothing seemed like it had been deleted.

I noticed another name though, someone she'd not brought up. I opened that window and they had a pretty extensive message history in only the past month. This guy was a new hire at her work as well, at the same time she was hired, and at first it was professional work-related things, but then it turned into almost daily lunch arrangements. He would say where he was going, and she would say 'bring me with you' or something to that effect.

The messages got more and more flirtatious and playful, she sent a few selfies to him of her at work, and then the bad stuff started to hit. Apparently, in person, she had bragged about her oral sex technique after he had made a crude joke about some hot dogs she was eating for lunch. This devolved into a back and forth chat about things like his penis size, whether she could 'take it all,' him saying he'd be interested in experiencing this, and her leading him on with this whole dialogue. It wasn't quite sexting, but it was sexually explicit messaging.

I felt a lot of emotions at this point, called her in a rage, she sped home to try to talk to me, and once I calmed down she pretty much said it was just 'shit talking' and she had no interest in this guy, and she would never ACTUALLY go through with it. I can't help feeling like I just caught her before anything happened.

It seems pretty obvious that she wasn't getting the attention she wanted from me, and she felt like after two years the relationship wasn't going anywhere, that the next step (marriage) was never going to happen. Part of me is still angry and disgusted by what I saw, part of me is ashamed because I snooped through her messages and got so angry, and another part of me understands her point of view in a way.

I've never really experienced anything like this before in a relationship so I don't really know how to process all of this. It feels like she crossed a line, but she didn't DO anything physical. If it was just playful, yet crude, flirtations that she never intended to act on is this still as big a deal as I am making it out to be. I guess I know why she did it, but it doesn't make me feel any better and it doesn't make anything clearer.

If you've made it this far - thank you for reading this essay, I tend to over-think and over-explain a lot.

TL;DR - Girlfriend and I have had problems with me not giving her the sort of overt, masculine attention she's received in past relationships. She started having a flirtations and sexually explicit text dialog with a recent coworker. I snooped and found out, and now I don't know how to process all of this because part of me understands why she did it, and she didn't physically cheat on me.",2019-07-08 16:23:13,20,2,relationship_advice
130,can5vp,Squidd_Milk,"My boyfriend‚Äôs parents track his phone 24/7, and he‚Äôs not allowed to turn it off.","Hello reddit, I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right sub but I hope I can receive some advice from people here...

Me and my boyfriend are both 18 and from the UK. Ever since I have known him, his whole immediate family track each other using the Find my Friends app on their phones, this includes his mum, dad, older sister and himself. They can all see each other‚Äôs location 24/7. I personally have always found this very strange since he has never given a reason for his parents to feel they need to know his location at all times, (never been in trouble or ran away etc...). When he turns it off, they find out almost immediately and tell him to turn it back on, even if he is at home in his room. 
Now that he is 18 and legally an adult, he has told me that he doesn‚Äôt like it. It also makes me feel uncomfortable as when I‚Äôm with him, It feels like I‚Äôm also being tracked. He tried turning it off the other day but his dad threatened to take his phone and stop paying his phone bill. I think this is semi-fair as his dad is paying for the phone, so agreeing to keep the app on I suppose makes sense. I said that once he gets a job he can pay for his own phone bill and therefore he does not have the obligation to keep the app at all. 
But despite this, I still can‚Äôt help but feel this is..wrong? Am I being weird or is it strange to track your adult child‚Äôs whereabouts at all times. I know that if my mum wanted to start tracking me I would not only be very weirded out but I‚Äôd also feel upset that she doesn‚Äôt trust me, I‚Äôd feel like my privacy is being invaded and I‚Äôd feel like a part of my independence has been taken away from me, but maybe this is because I‚Äôve always been very independent and my mother trusts me enough to not feel like she has to track my phone? Compared to my boyfriend who isn‚Äôt necessarily not independent, but definitely relies on his mum and dad more than I ever have.

Anyways, what do you think? Are there any parents who have an opinion on this? There‚Äôs not really much I can do because it‚Äôs not my situation but I‚Äôm very curious to know what people think of all this. Thanks!!",2019-07-08 16:21:45,11,8,relationship_advice

133,can3w8,CompleteNorth,Unsure if I should act on signals I'm receiving from a women,"Hey Reddit, 

The story is basically this: I met a women and we understand each other quiet well I believe. We text every day, have seen each other almost every day in the last week and talk about a lot with the time flying by while we talk. 

I do believe I get a lot of signals of interest from her. We talk very openly about a lot of (sometimes very personal) stuff, she seems very interested to talk to me, meet up and meet for extended periods of time (even inviting me to dinner at her place while I visited her to help her with something). She comes close to me (without really touching eachother) and seems to enjoy our time together as much as I do. 

By know I can't deny to have a crush on her, but I don't know what I should make of this, because there are a few problems: 

* she has a boyfriend in another country and they have been long distance for some time, but will move in together in the foreseeable future

* she has told me multiple times, that she has had many instances, were her behaviour was wrongly interpreted as signals (because it's simply her personality/way) and guys have ruined the friendship by crushing for her. Im relativ sure, that she has picked up on my interest in her... 

* I'm not in a place for a relationship at the moment, but would be interested in a romance

* I feel like an asshole even entertaining the thought of a romance since she has a bf and I would cause trouble...

My question is basically what should I do?
I would like to tell her: ""don't worry about me. I'm fine with how things are going and I can ignore the signals, but I'd like you to tell me, if your signals mean something and let us talk about that something"" basically telling her don't worry about me, but if you are up for something I'm here/let's talk. But I don't think that is a good way to handle this and could ruin the time we have... 


It's further complicated by the fact that I do not have a lot of experience with these things despite my age (mid 20s) and have been single for a longer time... 

Up until now I've only told her ""don't worry about what I perceive as signals and your behaviour in my presence! it's all good!"" but I feel like I need to talk to her about it...

135,can3qb,hmbutwhataboutthis,Girlfriend (24F) lies without regret to me (28M),"Background: 
Been together five months. She pursued me but I decided to date someone else. I broke up with that someone else and texted her - she immediately drops the guy she‚Äôs with and we start dating. Obsessed over me she admits - typical things but also talking with her friends about having sexual fantasies about me while she (I think) was with whoever she was with. Talks a lot about marriage and kids constantly. Constantly wants to be with me, afraid of being alone, her body validation very important, insecure about sex at times. 

What happened:
In month one I had a feeling she went thru my room on a night I woke up early for work. My drawer contains my highly sensitive and private medication. I have also suspected she goes thru my phone. Called her on both on Sunday. She admitted. Tried to keep my cool. Explained that I get she‚Äôs insecure (made excuse for her). Later that night she tells me she loves me for first time....
Next day I tell her to stop talking to her friends about my personal health conditions to her friend. I asked if she told her friend about our conversation. She says no. Shows me her phone after I tell her to. She did talk to her friend saying things like ‚ÄúI told him I didn‚Äôt regret it but then I was like why am I being dumb say you regret it‚Äù and ‚Äúhe called me out hard‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how he knew‚Äù. 
I find she can be disrespectful in general - wandering eyes (mentioned this to her but she completely denied). 

Question here... what are your thoughts on next steps? I talk about everything that is on my mind with her - I am an emotional externalizer, she the opposite. 
Gut feeling not good with someone who is always prone to avoiding conflict, does not talk about her emotions, and is interested in pleasing everyone else. ‚ÄúI lie because it‚Äôs easier than rocking the boat.‚Äù",2019-07-08 16:17:26,19,2,relationship_advice

So the last few years have been kinda rough. I‚Äôve been studying engineering at university and honestly, I fucking hate it. But it‚Äôs a great degree so I stuck with it. I didn‚Äôt have many friends through uni, I usually made them through sport but I got injured and couldn‚Äôt play. Engineering is all dudes so I struggled to meet girls in a meaningful way. I‚Äôd only meet them at nightclubs and that scene just doesn‚Äôt fit with me at all. Tbh, I‚Äôve been extremely lonely. 

I finally met a girl. She was amazing, I‚Äôm super picky and she just fit everything I wanted. Super hot, super talented, super confident. Only issue was she was totally broken. We got pretty close and intimate but she was a little bit emotionally abusive and kinda broke me. whether this was intentional or not I don‚Äôt know. The whole thing was just a total shit show. She ended up saying some pretty hurtful things to me and just totally ghosted me. 

I usually coped with this by talking to my mum. But it‚Äôs become so stressful for her now that I don‚Äôt feel I can talk to her about it she just worries too much. 

So I‚Äôm basically totally on my own now. I don‚Äôt like any of my friends except one or two. I don‚Äôt like my career and I can‚Äôt see one I‚Äôd actually want to do. I can‚Äôt play sports. My only saving grace right now is that it‚Äôs my final year coming up and then I can just move away and start new. 

I‚Äôd love to have a relationship again. But my I know my mind will accept nothing less than what I have with this previous girl now I know I can get it. But I don‚Äôt know how the hell I‚Äôll find it , it was a bit of a needle in the haystack situation. I don‚Äôt want to be lonely and on my own for years again.

I just don‚Äôt know where to go from here. I feel like the more time passes the more mentally unstable I‚Äôm getting. I already have an anxiety disorder and I‚Äôm worried about depression now too. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Feel like I‚Äôm in a bit of a crisis.

137,can3fr,cjohnston98,"Dealing with a recovering drug addict, should I leave?","Me and my fiancee have been together for nearly 10 years. We're both 21 and met when we were 11 and have been together since then. From ages 11-16 it was great but he was young and wanted to pursue other things as did I so we broke up until we were 19 years old. Then we were brought back together by him calling me and telling me he was going through serious benzo withdrawal. I came as he was still my best friend and pretty much brought him back to life. For the first couple months they were awful. Filled with drug use, cheating, lying, abuse. Yes, I should have left then but I stuck around and then bam I'm pregnant. Mind you through all of this even though things were kind of bad, we were madly in love. We always have been. The good out weighed the bad by a million. Well I told him a million times that I realize he can mess up, and all I need from him is to be honest about his drug use so I know if he is going to become addicted to anything out of nowhere or is hurting himself. Everytime he uses he lies to me and it makes me feel crazy. After I became pregnant everything was nearly perfect. Just a few spats here and there and the drug use stopped. The arguing stopped. He's got our life together which is a really big achievement since he started seizing out on the floor because of withdrawal. He's never had anything in his life. His whole family are addicts and drugs are really all he knows. But now he has us a house and a new car and he's loving and caring and goes to work everyday and he's been clean. I told him that once our son gets here if he lied to me about pills I'd leave him because my son deserves more. My son's a month old now and he used vicodin a few days ago and lied to me about it, then a few days later after having a very heartfelt convo about how he loves me and it'll never happen again he used Xanax. Then we had this whole convo all over again and I decided to stay. Then the next day he lied to me and took tramadol and was in the process of looking for oxys. He works at a moving company and it's really rough on his body. He's constantly hurting chronically. He says the reason for the use is because he was hurting so badly and he was afraid to ask me if he could use pain killers because he felt he needed them and he knew I'd say no. If he would have asked I would have allowed him to take a vicodin or tramadol, but never a Xanax. He even said himself he hasnt been afraid for me to leave because we have been through so much worse he didn't think I'd actually leave. If I leave him I won't have a house or a car. I don't have a job and I'm only a month postpartum so I have no money saved up. I love him to death but I'm worried that the only way to give my son a sober father is to leave. But at the same time I'm worried that since I'm his only support if I leave he will fall down the rabbit hole. What should I do?",2019-07-08 16:16:51,2,0,relationship_advice

We dated for a little over half a year, around that time he was getting busy with university exams, which was understandable. However, I‚Äôm kind of the talking type, where I would ask my SO how their day was etc etc, but my ex wasn‚Äôt like that and was more of a workaholic. It was like having a long distance relationship, except we were living only 30 minutes away from each other.  I kind of saw our difference and decided to break it off with him since it wouldn‚Äôt be fair for either of us. He says he respects my decision and we break up. After a few months, I started seeing this guy(my current BF and same age as me) and we ended up dating. A few months into our relationship one night I received a phone call from an unknown number. I usually wouldn‚Äôt answer an unknown number but the number didn‚Äôt start with a 3, which means it‚Äôs a telemarketer, so I figured the person behind the phone was just someone who accidentally dialed my number.

I asked why he was calling me all of a sudden and I kid you not, he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, my heart just tells me to find you‚Äù I just straight up replied ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù with a sort of uncomfortable laugh. He then asks of my relationship status to which I said taken and very happy. He expressed ‚Äòhurt‚Äô(?) and ‚Äòjokingly‚Äô asked if I interested in having one more boyfriend. At that point I lost interest in that conversation and simply replied yeahs and mhmms to his statements. He think he could tell because he said he‚Äôll hang up and will call me soon. After he hung up, he messaged me asking if we could continue chatting on whatsapp or by phone call. I replied ‚ÄúI guess‚Äù .

141,can2cn,SeraphinCoinCoin,I (23M) want to seduce my girlfriend (23F) another time,"Sorry for the long post and probably bad english.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to share a story and receive some advices from strangers. Here is the story of my couple: 

&amp;#x200B;

I(23M) met my girlfriend(23F) on highshcool where she was dating another guy and me another girl. One day, I break up with my ex (she cheated on me). Few months later, it's my girlfriend turn to break up with her boyfriend (he cheated on her). During 2 years, we talked to each other as a friend. A good one, but a friend. I started to develop sentiments and flirt with her during summer 2014. One night we had sex and it was the most intense and beautiful thing I had experienced yet. She told me that she wants me to be her boyfriend but the stupid man I was thinked it was only due to the endorphine. We met to have sex during one month and she told me the same thing during this month : ""You and me could be the most amazing couple ever"". As stupid as I was, I thinked that I know better than her that she wouldn't be happy with me. I was scared to let another woman hurt me and to hear her say that we could be happy together was hurtful for me as I really thinked that she only liked the sex part. On september 2014, I asked her if she would be my girlfriend and she said yes.

&amp;#x200B;

I was really really deep in love with her. She was the most interesting human being I ever met and the most beautiful woman I ever seen. I wanted to spend all my time with her. I slowly started to isolate myself : I didn't see any of my friend and didn't meet anyone new. She was jealous of a friend of mine (woman) which was too ""close"" for her. It was a really good friend and I didn't want anything besides a friendship whith this girl. I was so in love with my girlfriend, I told to my friend that we cannot talk as often as before. I lost a good friend this day. At this time, I studied computer science at university and none of my peers seems to have the same interests as me. I didn't do any friend during university, so I didn't go to the parties or talked to the other. In the same time, as the brilliant woman she is, she made tons of new friends, went to parties and do all the stuff that a student do. Although, it was wonderful between us. We made each other laugh all the time. She's truly the jewel of my world. Fast forward to 2016. Her grandmother died this year. It was a very very important person for her. She was very sad. I was very supportive. I bought her flowers, we went on picnics, we talked about it often. I did not want to let her down. It was a very hard time for her. In 2017 I started to work in IT Security. It was hard for me to start to ""really"" work because it was nothing like I was prepared during my studies. And I started to work because the school I wanted rejected me. Two times. I learned a lot of things at work but it was hard. I started to feel a bit anxious about my job. 2017 is also the year where my father-in-law had a jawbone operation. The surgeons failed at their job and my father in law suffered a lot from thi operation. My girlfriend was very anxious about his father. I was as supportive as I can. Everytime she was going to see him, I came with her. I told her that we can talk about it and she never wanted. One time, I carried his father to hospital (control radio) given that he could not drive due to the past surgery. The fact that my father in law was very very in pain whith his jaw started to alert the surgeon. They planned another surgery. My girlfriend did not want me to be present the day of the operation. So I stayed at home (I lived at my parent's house and my girlfriend in his flat). The night before the surgery, I setted up an alarm in the morning to text her and to have some news. And I fucked up. I woke up too early : ""Cool, I have plenty of time before the alarm"". So I tell myself that I can sleep again. I woke up in panic. I watch the clock : 11AM. The operation was at 7AM. ""Why the f\*ck this stupd alarm didn't ring ?!"". The alarm has ringed, I just turned it off. My girlfriend is mad as f\*ck. The fact that I was unable to woke up to support her was very very disappointing for her. Her father was in very bad mental condition (due to the pain) and she take my ""disinterest"" as a treason. I apologized and I was very shameful. During the afternoon, I went to the hospital to see my father-in-law.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that the backgroud is planted, here is where all f\*cked up. In 2018, she started to tell me that I do not provide kind though to her. As if I don't feel in love anymore. It was recurrent. But I was not less in love. I was just anxious about my job. My job started a few months ago and I was anxious about it. I thinked all of the time ""Will I be able to make it ?"". ""Will my boss be happy about my job?"" this kind of things. I told her that starting to work was hard for me as I feel not ""armed"" for this. (I learned a lot by myself, but it's not the point of this post). For her studies, she had to do an internship. She found the internship of her dreams at 2h30 from her home in car. I realized that during 6 months my girlfriend will be far from me. I was feared. How could I do without my girlfriend. It was between Mars 2018 and September 2018. I went to see her each week-end. There was only 3 week-end where I was unable to do it. But the blames continued. She had the feeling that I did not love her anymore. Despite the fact that we talked a lot about it, I didn't understand how she could told me that I love her less given that I made the drive to see her every week.

&amp;#x200B;

In October she started a new internship. This time far away. It was at 8 hours from my home and the nearest airport from her location was at 4 hours. The first week-end of her internship, she went to a party with a friend(I will named her Jess) of her. She met a guy(let's name this guy FDP). It's the friend of Jess. When the party is finished she told me that she wished I look at her the way FDP look at her. It was very hurtful to hear it. It's not that I don't look at her in a loving way, it's that she does not realize it. Some of my girlfriend's friends told her that she's lucky to have me or that I'm a really good guy. We talked about it.

&amp;#x200B;

In november 2018, I joined her for my birthday. We spent the week-end together and she admits that she texts with FDP since the party (two weeks). She did not tell me before because ""we were not in very good terms and you would have been anxious"". I told her that it does not bother me (it bothered me a lot but I don't want to be the type of guy that setup ""fences"" around his GF).

&amp;#x200B;

In december, she told me that FDP suggest to her that it will be ""cool"" if he could come see her. It was a 5 hours round-trip drive. I told her that she do what she want but I was very upset and very anxious. FDP came to see her. They spent a bunch of time together and he quit her flat at 5AM. I was unable to sleep the night. I was afraid of what could have been done by my girlfriend. I called her in the morning in tears. She reassured me. I asked her if there is things that she didn't told me and I have to know. She sents me 20+ screen captures of her convo with FDP. They were clearly flirting. I felt heartbroken. My girlfriend, the love of my life, the mother I wanted for my children was flirting with another guy.

&amp;#x200B;

I did not explode in anger. I was truly heartbroken. All I could do was crying. She started to feel shameful. She did not realized that they were flirting. She thinked that the only thing FDP wanted was a friendship. I was in love, so I trusted her.

&amp;#x200B;

We're now in February 2019. It's been one month since I have my own flat (I live alone and my girlfriends is doing internships for her studies). She's starting a new internship at 2h30 from my home. This time, she come back every week-end to pet her horse (she practice riding and is very good at it). But there is the problem : she's is the city where FDP studies. They start to meet two times a week. It really upset me. We often argue about it. I tell her that this guy want her and she keeps telling that he is only a friend. One night I had a feeling in the gut. I was unable to sleep. I know that she met FDP this night. I call her in the morning. She told me that we have to talk. Last night they were drunk. they kissed each other. And ther sleep together !! I fell on the ground in tears. She explains that thed did not have sex, they ""only"" sleep together. I told her that we have to talk when she come back (it was Friday morning, she cames back every friday evening). I told her that as long as we did not have a serious discussion, she cannot talk with FDP. But they lunched together this day. And when she had finished her work, she talked with him about how she had fu\*ked up, she should never have done that etc. I was furious. She was talking with this guy and I was waiting for her in the same time. When she finally arrived, I stayed calm. I told her that I can't trust her and that she betrayed me. We talked a lot. She was in tears. To see the love of my life in tears finished to break my heart. I did not want her to feel shameful. I told her that we are going through this together, that everything will be ok. That this act is not going to define who she is. She felt shameful. I told her that I can't support the fact that she can see, text or talk to this guy. She seems depressed. I stayed on my words during few days. But she seems sad. So I told her that she can see him, but only if there is other people (that she knows) around. She had a talk with the guy where she explains that she loves me and she can't be with him. FDP wrote a letter of how it was perfect between us, the only thing missing is sex. And they don't talked during 2 months. Thes 2 months were super cool but I had difficulties to engage myself in this relationships. Me girlfriend had the sensation that she has to do all the job. But I needed some time to completely forgive her and go on.

&amp;#x200B;

In april, Jess was returning from a long trip. My girlfriend really wanted to see Jess. Jess lives in my city so my girlfriend planned to do the round-trip drive. But FDP is also the best friend of Jess and he was going to be there. They were only 4 people at this little party : Jess, his boyfriend, FDP, my girlfriend. I told my girlfriend that I don't want her to came back to the city of her internship with FDP (my girlfriend was coming in bus and FDP in car). She had bought her return ticket but she came back in FDP's car. I was so upset but another time I forgave her.  3 weeks ago she told me that FDP was trying to flirt with her by text. I told her what to reply but she seems annoyed. We talked about it and she finished by send the message that I wanted. She also told me that when they were at Jess's home, they hugs each other. Another time I feel betrayed. During 3 weeks they did not talk. But it was not all fun and games between me and my girlfriend. I had difficulties to make effort or to trust her. And last week, we break up. I can't trust her. And she had changed a lot since we've met. She was so loyal, righteous, fun and interesting. Now, I don't recognize her. She is becoming a normal human being. I now that the fact that I did'nt woke up for her father operation is still a grudge for her. And I know that she felt alone for a moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I also know that she does not want to be a cheater and she want to reconnect with herself. And I know I can help her. It's been one week since we broke up. It opened my eyes. I have been blind. My girlfriend was craving for attention and I didn't supply her. I know that she slept with FDP during this week. But I want her. I know deep inside that we can be very happy together. We have been together during 5 years. The last year and a half have been shitty, but I know that we are gonna go through this. She's on a road trip for her internship so she can't see FDP before the end of the internship (end of July). I will use this time to amaze her. I never danced with her. I'm going to some dance courses and next week, I'm going to bring her to dance. I'm convinced that we are gonna be happy and all this shit period is just temporary. I know that I want this woman for the rest of my life. I knows that she is going to be the mother of my children.

&amp;#x200B;

Please, tell me what you think about it, I love her so much.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr : My gf was craving for attention. I did not supply her. Another guy join the battle, now we're not together anymore. I want to seduce her another time.

142,can2a2,situaza,I'm losing my mind.. we moved into a tiny apartment and he won't let me change the furniture. He said I will NEVER control him... HELP,"My fiance sold his house a couple of months ago.  He chose to sink any cash he made into debt and rent an apartment.  I currently have a place in another city that I pay for ...due to work travel but we almost always stay together.  Meaning, when I go there for work ...he typically comes along.  But we spend the majority of the time in his town.

Anyway,  he is paying for HIS apartment.  And he brought all of the BIG furniture from his house into this tiny apartment.  He listed his furniture for sale but he wanted almost new prices and we had a terrible fight because I suggested he drop the price so we could sell it and get more adequate size furniture.   That was 2 months ago.  He still hasn't.    He told me that I need to just deal with what he has....and that he won't buy a new couch until he sells that one.  

He told me then that he was planning to live in that apartment forever....never buy a house with me.  And that he's sick of my high maintenance attitude.  I knew it wouldn't take long for him to hate his apartment too.  It's super loud.  It's crowded.  We have a golden retriever who is anxious because there's very little room for him to lay down on the floor because there's SO MUCH CRAP.

So, he finally admitted it. The other morning he couldn't sleep due to the bright light in the apartment bedroom and loud music at 5am...and he said we can't stay here.   I didn't say anything because I knew it would be a fight.  So then...later in the day, he told me that it will be fine.   Glad I didn't say anything.

Then yesterday he suggested we drive around and look for houses.  I said what?  He said well, maybe someday we can get a house.  I said you said never again?  He said you always have to start a fight.  We drove around and I didn't say much knowing I shouldn't get excited.  He would never buy one.  He is just acting so schizophrenic! 

So this morning...I was covered in dog hair..tripping over shit and I told him I had to go to Starbucks or something to work.  I couldn't take it.  My eyes literally tear all night due to allergies from dog hair that's all over the bed even though I vacuum it.  

I love the dog....but I'm dying!    HE said ""you seem so miserable here....you don't make me feel very good about this place at all.... nothing makes you happy""  I said LOOK AT MY EYES!  I can't get them to stop tearing....   

I can't take the place any longer.  I offered to contribute in the beginning before he picked this place and he said no....he wouldn't take my money and I was just going to have to deal with him or leave.",2019-07-08 16:14:20,18,4,relationship_advice
143,can25p,Crucifister,I want to break up with my girlfriend but I don't know how.,"I (21/m) and her (28/f) are in a relationship for two years now. We live together in an apartment where she is the renter.
She has a borderline disorder which makes our relationship merely bearable. She often starts fights where I always end up to be the asshole. She doesn't even need more than a bad mood to start a fight.
Farther she doesn't want me to meet my friends (at least those she doesn't like), I'm not allowed to go to a party without her because there could be other woman, etc. The list goes on. 
I can't bear it anymore and I don't love her anymore to be honest.
In a normal relationship I would tell her how I feel and that I move out but this one is different.
I tried to break up a few times before but she always threatens to kill herself and of course I can't let that happen, so I come back. Once she even tried but just ended up getting sick for a few days from the pills she swallowed (she knew the pills wouldn't kill her. I guess she just wanted to scare me).
Also she destroys my stuff when she's angry on me, today my gaming headset and the strings on my guitar for example.
I have a lot of stuff I spent a good amount of money on and I'm really afraid she breaks it, too.

I don't know how to end it without her killing herself or my possessions becoming rubbish.
She will be away for probably four weeks in september and I was thinking about moving out but I feel like an asshole doing so.

I don't know what to do. The only thing that makes sense to me is being with her until one of us dies",2019-07-08 16:14:04,3,1,relationship_advice
144,can1ja,blinker1eighty2,My dog of 7 years bit my 4 week old kitten and killed him and now I can‚Äôt look at him the same.,"I‚Äôm not sure where to post this so mods feel free to remove this, but my relationship with my dog was one of the strongest, closest relationships in my life. 

A little back story, we recently (a month ago) rescued a 1 day old kitten from being abandoned by his mother and proceeded to bottle feed and raise it. I would wake up 3-4 times a night to ensure that he was going to the bathroom and eating regularly. Everything was great and I was developing a really strong bond with the kitten, it felt as though the kitten imprinted on me and would always seek my comfort and care, especially when he had a hard time sleeping. This continued on for 4 weeks where I was present for all his major milestones: eyes opening, ears opening, standing, walking, eating wet food. But now he‚Äôs gone. 

I love my dog, but now I have a deep resentment for him and can barley look at him. He‚Äôs never shown signs of aggression and he‚Äôs been around cats all his life. It‚Äôs really hard to even believe what he did. My mom called me at work sobbing to tell me that my dog had bit the kitten and telling that she was on the way to the emergency vet clinic with the kitten and our neighbor. I left work and rushed over to the clinic to beat them there and make sure that emergency treatment was waiting for them when they walked through the door and I got to hold him one last time before he passed away in the back. When they brought him out so we could say goodbye I just broke down. I‚Äôm only 21 and I‚Äôve never had a child and I can‚Äôt compare the pain I feel now to losing a human child, but it hurt so much to see something that I had cared for and loved like a child, dead in my arms. Especially being so young and full of a future that I was excited to start my young adult life with. 

I‚Äôve had my dog since I was 15 and he was two when we got him from a hoarder. He was my best friend in the whole world, but now I can‚Äôt look at him. I can‚Äôt sleep with him. I can‚Äôt even be near him because I have so much anger and resentment for him. I would never hurt him because I know that he probably didn‚Äôt mean to hurt him, because he‚Äôd been so gentle to the kitten before. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to lose my best friend and my kitten, but I can‚Äôt see myself ever forgiving him.",2019-07-08 16:12:46,16,4,relationship_advice
145,can1ff,captincaptincap,"I (25/M) broke up with my ex-gf (24/F) about a month ago, and she is begging for closure. Would it be helpful to tell her more?","I broke up with my ex-gf of 3 months about a month ago. Initially I felt really really bad because it was a little bit out of the blue for her. I had reaffirmed her a bunch just a couple of days before I broke up with her. 

The reason I did it was there were certain times in the relationship where she would say or some things that would make me really really really anxious. The main problem was that she wanted to be together ALL of the time and I have a lot of hobbies and friends that I also wanted to invest my time in. Obviously I understand there is give and take in relationships so I was sacrificing certain things I like to do to spend time with her. I told her I was gonna have to do my own thing some times though and said I would just regulate that myself. It was difficult though because she would often get very mopey and kind of pout when I would either go home for the night or say I had to do something else. It got to the point where I felt like I couldn't talk about anything I did with anyone else because she would be jealous of that. 

I couldn't sleep one night and got super anxious and broke up with her right before a date I was supposed to take her on. I was a mess then and didn't make any sense so I came back twice and told her calmly I wanted to break up. I didn't really get into specifics because I didn't want to come off critical, but she says she needs to meet and talk about it because she is confused weeks later. All I told her was that the point of this was aiming towards marriage and I made the decision that is not what I wanted, and essentially we are not a match. 

She was crazy obsessed with me which makes this so much harder. She apparently started crushing on me from a relationship where they were talking about marriage. She was telling me I was the greatest thing since sliced bread which was starting to make me more uncomfortable than flattered. 

I would really like to stay friends with this person, but I have no idea how to make that happen. I told her that I didn't want to meet up and haven't responded to her requests after that. We have mutual friends and I have been avoiding her since the breakup. Would it be at all beneficial to breakdown why I broke up with her if my reasons largely have to do with her jealousy and insecurities. 

TL;DR: I broke up with my ex 3 times and she still wants closure. Would another meeting be beneficial?
Edit: I told here we need to break up 3 times, but this is all for the first time.",2019-07-08 16:12:30,8,6,relationship_advice
146,can13m,foxhill1996,"I (22F) suffer with pretty severe mental illnesses, how can I make it easier on my boyfriend (29M)?","We‚Äôve been together for two and a half years and he knows of my issues. I have severe OCD and go through periods of bad agoraphobia and panic attacks. I see a therapist, take medication and work with my local mental health team. I‚Äôm currently going through a bad patch of agoraphobia and it‚Äôs got me really depressed. To make matters worse, my boyfriend really doesn‚Äôt understand and tells me to just ‚Äúget over it and push past it to go out.‚Äù 

It sounds harsh but he means well and cares about me, he just doesn‚Äôt understand it and it clearly frustrates him that he can‚Äôt help. 

A few weeks ago he told me he has considered breaking up as he can‚Äôt do normal couple things with me like going out. I got better for a while, went back to work part time and we managed to do fun things. I‚Äôm still better, but have had a relapse where I‚Äôm really depressed and unable to go out alone. I can still go out with him, so we can still do most things, I just can‚Äôt go alone and I‚Äôm back off work.

I know he‚Äôs frustrated, and I expressed that it hurt when he says he wanted to break up, but he then cried and said he loves me but he doesn‚Äôt know what to do. I live with him and have no family anywhere near by, so he‚Äôs basically my rock. 

I want to make it easier on him but I don‚Äôt know how. I don‚Äôt want to be awake at the moment, don‚Äôt want to clean or look after myself but I manage to do most of this for him.

147,can0ga,hiroshimasfoot,I went on vacation with my boyfriend‚Äôs family which was anything but a vacation for me. How should I handle this?,"I made an earlier post in this subreddit mentioning this a few weeks ago. Albeit I was excited for this vacation, but towards the end of the week I wanted desperately to go home. 

I have to start off by saying I have extreme anxiety induced by OCD. that will explain why I felt the way I did throughout this ordeal. 

I am not used to living with small children. I am the youngest in my family with a 21 year old brother. I went on this vacation with my boyfriend (17), his mother, his step father, brother(8), cousin(16), and sister(10). The entire freaking week his brother got on my nerves so much. He would fart in the car or enclosed spaces and everyone would laugh and put it off but it really wasn‚Äôt funny to me. He would scream constantly, cry when he didn‚Äôt get enough attention and whine if things didn‚Äôt go his way. He would really pull my strings when it came to my ocd, I would ask him nicely not to mess up my tics that I did and he would do it anyway to ‚Äúbe funny‚Äù which really gave me anxiety. He ended up calling me weird for my tics, which I am incredibly insecure about. His mother coddles him anytime he does anything wrong, including insulting me and I can‚Äôt say anything about it. She knows I am insecure about my mental issues but she laughs it off like a joke because it‚Äôs her spoiled kid. I ended up sleeping outside on the balcony of the hotel room often because of this.

Any time the children listen is when my boyfriend or his cousin yells at them to knock it off. Their parents don‚Äôt do anything to parent them properly. They are vulgar constantly and extremely messy. I had to continuously clean up after them in the hotel room because that‚Äôs how my OCD is. It‚Äôs okay to be a little disorganized, but I mean there was trash and food everywhere. They would buy things, use them once, or not at all, and just throw them away. 

The second night in Miami, my boyfriend‚Äôs step father got incredibly intoxicated and started screaming at everyone and punching the walls. His mom started fighting with him and I ended up having to tell everyone to get out of the hotel room. The rest of the week they all acted like nothing happened and it really fucked with me. It completely changed my view of his family. My boyfriend asked his mom if she was going to cut the step father off of drinking and she just went ‚Äúnope. I‚Äôm not dealing with this‚Äù. Like... seriously? You‚Äôd rather put your children and someone you invited on this trip through stress instead of deal with it? 

We went out to eat the 5th night there and I ended up crying in the restaurant bathroom because of how stressed I was. When we went back to the hotel I threw up from stress and while I was throwing up the little brother was making fun of me and saying ‚Äúewwwww!‚Äù Which pissed me off so much. 

There‚Äôs so many other details that I can‚Äôt fit into this post because it‚Äôs just incredibly lengthy. I can of course give more info to those who ask in the comments. 

The only times I actually enjoyed myself was being alone with my boyfriend. We went out to a really nice restaurant together like the 6th night there and that was the highlight of the vacation for me. If I try to bring up how his family makes me feel to my boyfriend, he gets a little weird and I try my best not to offend him. But I think it upsets him a little that I didn‚Äôt enjoy my time with his family. 

I don‚Äôt know how I should go about this. I look at his family completely different now. I really didn‚Äôt have a good time with them at all , I was stressed and anxious the entire time. I don‚Äôt want to have a horrible relationship with them. I love my boyfriend, we get along really great. But I just don‚Äôt know how to deal with this. Maybe I‚Äôm being too picky? What should I do? I haven‚Äôt told my parents, they think I had a great time. Should I ? I don‚Äôt want to ruin things.",2019-07-08 16:10:26,1,1,relationship_advice

149,camz9y,NotMagicJustScience,My(f20) boyfriend(m20) of three years won't move out with me,"Hey everyone, thanks for reading. I have the last to years or so not been happy at home, because of my parents being horrible strict and single minded. This has also resulted in my to siblings (f51) and (m46) wanting to get out of the house fast when they were young, and the reason my brother doesn't talk that much with our parents. 


Because me and my parents don't get along I suffer from anxiety and depressing and I barely sleep at night, pretty much stressing about everything.

I really need to move out, and also everyone around me encouraging me to do so, including my psychologist and my siblings, because of how horrible I feel. 

The problem is that I don't have enough money to move out alone and I need to move out with someone, to afford it, and have been asking my boyfriend a lot of times and been rejected, because he is doing pretty good at home, he feel safe I guess.

In the start of the relationship he kept asking me to move out with him, but after a couple of months, he got cold feet, and then when we had been to years together, he again wanted to move out, and then got cold feet again... 

I can't really do anything about him not wanting to move out with me, but I can't help feeling hurt and I have been questioning the relationships a lot, because it has left me not feeling like he loves me as much as I love him, because I would have moved out for him, if he had it that bad. 

Am I wrong for feeling this way? I feel bad for feeling this way, but I can't help it, feeling that he doesn't care enough. 


I would really like some advice and opinions about what to do, thank you very much!, By the way english is not my first language so I apologize for my grammar.",2019-07-08 16:08:00,2,0,relationship_advice
150,camz0y,InstantCheeseSnacc,"Girlfriend (24 F) and I (24 M) are having less sex and are generally less intimate. Is this normal, or a sign that the relationship won't last.","I have been in an amazing relationship with my GF for almost three years. Lots of love, and we are truly compatible, as far as I'm concerned.

Regarding our sex life, at first, we could not stop having sex and would do it at every chance we got. Obviously, I know this is usually how the ""honeymoon"" phase is and it fades away eventually, and that's exactly what happened later on. Sex became gradually less frequent and it is now at a point where we usually go around two months without having any.

It is worth noting that we don't live together, we both live with our parents, but she stays over at my place a lot and we could easily sneak some sexy time in if we wanted to.

Another issue that might be causing it is that we both have jobs that can be tiring, and she is also getting her masters degree and just went through a tough exam phase that burned her out a bit (especially because she works and studies at the same time). 

I can easily understand having less sex is normal because of these factors, and I'm honestly not horny all the time as well so this isn't a major relationship deal breaker for us and we are still pretty happy together and constantly planning our future.

The thing that bothers me is that general intimacy is also a bit slow, and this is something that can be attributed to her. I am frequently going for kisses, hugs and cuddles and while she sometimes responds positively to that, she also pushes me away often.

We spoke about this openly and honestly and she told me that she doesn't realize she does that and probably it's only because of how tired and anxious she was during these last few weeks.

I believe we still love each other, but I'm also scared that I'm starting to become more of a best friend than a romantic and sexual interest for her.

We are currently giving each other some time to think about this, and have agreed to not see each other for a week.

So my question is, how normal is this situation, and is it something that we can overcome? Am I panicking over something that is just a normal phase to be expected of longer relationships? Or are we done for as a couple?

Thank you for taking the time to read, and hopefully you will help me figure this out.",2019-07-08 16:07:32,6,3,relationship_advice
151,camyvl,xdionne,It's been a week and I haven't heard from him..,"I (25) met this guy (26) more than month ago through an app and have had the most fun weeks I've had in awhile. I won't lie when I say we fell for each other pretty fast because we just clicked right away. He was the first one to say he really liked me, but I asked that if we can take it slow since I ended up jumping in too early in my last relationship and it ended badly, and he said sure and will respect my feelings for it. Fast forward a week, we've reconciled after a mini argument and he asks again if we can be in a relationship. Again, I said I really like him, but asked if it is okay to wait a little.. he said he'll wait. 

Now he did have some important family events unfolding in his life at some point and I thought he was going to be affected.. and he is, but he seems apathetic about it which concerned me a bit.. I tried to be supportive about it, but he hated the feeling over the situation.. and he just wanted to get away and move on from it..

Today marks one week of him not speaking to me after he decided to tell me that he needs to take things slower after I told him my feelings for him. He said he needed to handle things and won't know when he'll be around again. I tried to reach out, but I just don't get any responses from him.. but I see him active on his social media.. it's clear that he's ignoring me.. 

Should I press further..? Should I wait more..? Or should I just let it go and just think of him as the ""one that got away""? I know we aren't in a relationship, and it's pretty early on to have some aching feelings, but I miss him and it hurt when this happened.. I just hope he is okay and I'm also hoping to hear from him someday..",2019-07-08 16:07:11,3,2,relationship_advice

153,camxbu,clueless_coder888,"I [33m] am not exactly sure what to do with one of my best friends [32f] - more than friend, but less than girlfriend, stuck in the middle","I have quite a weird complicated relationship with one of my best friends ( I never thought of it as weird before, but the more I tell people, the more they said this kind of relationship is unusual). I know this friend, let's call her SS for almost 10 years now, and during the last 7/8 years we messaged each other almost every day, she know everything about me and I know everything about her. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We moved around quite a bit so were never in the same city in the past, however few years back she moved back to our hometown and I also moved back here about 3 years ago. We are not dating anyone else, so a few months after I came back we talked that maybe we should try to date one another, well that failed miserably, it was awkward as fuck, felt very difficult to treat her like romantic partner than a good friend. I also felt like she started ghosting me, refused to communicate etc, and she felt I was still treating our relationship as if it is just friendship not putting in effort etc. We grew apart a bit for few weeks after that, but then started hanging out again, and then just resumed becoming friends again, text each other everyday, hang out two-three times a week (we don't have many mutual friends here, we actually met in another city even though we are from the same city funnily, so it is always just two of us hanging out). A lot of these hanging out are almost like dates, it is not one hour lunch/coffee kind of thing, but more like dinners on weekends where we spent hours together, just two of us  


  
Well here is the weird part from my side, I am not sure if I am overthinking this, which is why I want to ask opinions here. Everytime I talked to girls in dating apps like tinder, I kinda felt weird about it, first I am not sure how to bring up to future girlfriend that I have this girl which is sort of my ex gf albeit only for a few months that I am texting everyday still. Sometimes I even feel like I am cheating by using dating apps and I have to remind myself that for all intents and purposes, I am a single guy.  


  
Secondly, I am kinda not sure what will SS feel if I got a gf, I am not even sure what she regards me as. Thirdly, this actually applies to me as well. I am not too sure what is she to me. I really enjoy her companion, we spent so much times together, and talk everyday, yet I am not sure romantic relationship is the answer. We have tried before and it was not enjoyable to say the least. I definitely want SS in my life. Best friends are difficult to find, especially at this age. At times I am thinking maybe to keep our distance more, but we got along very well and this seems very unnatural, not to mention asshole-ish I feel, since I really like SS as a person and as a friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not even sure if I should bring this up to her since I feel that I should sort my own feeling first but I am not sure how to do so  


  
TLDR: have a best friend that I am not sure what my feeling toward her is and what her feeling toward me is. Can't live with her, can't live without her. Confused as fuck.",2019-07-08 16:03:46,1,1,relationship_advice

155,camvwv,InherentFrequencies,Told the Girl (19F) I Was Seeing That She Shouldn't Be With Me (20M)...," I met this girl on a dating app, we talked for a while and I decided to ask her to hang out sometime, and she agreed it would be a good idea. Fast forward to two days ago, I invited her to a fourth of July party at my friend's house. She showed up with one of her friends. We hit it off at first, and we kissed a few times, leading to full on making out. We were both drunk, and she asked me to come back to her apartment. We both had gotten up to leave, when her friend sees us and asks if we wanted to get food. Another guy at the party overhears us and says that he was just about to leave to get food, we should join him. Me and the girl I was with both agree and we head out, and the girl I was with starts making conversation with the guy. Lo and behold it turns out they grew up in the same neighborhood, also wanted to mention she is a Latina, and him being Mexican they hit it off much better than myself and her, with me being Indian. They were talking in Spanish, discussing their childhoods, and when we got to the restaurant as a foursome, I caught her looking at him sometimes. Eventually we got food, and with me having work at 9 AM, I told her I was ubering back, and she said she was as well with her friend. Hers arrives first, she waves bye to me and I had a feeling I was never going to see her again, as she had exchanged contact information with the other guy before leaving (we all shared contact info between the four of us). I took my ride home feeling rejected, when I get a text from her saying she had fun and if I wanted to hang out Friday. I was a bit taken aback as I felt the night hadn't ended well, but I agreed. Fast forward, we go on an actual date walking around the city, and eventually had sex at my apartment. Throughout the entire day I hadn't felt that spark that I thought I should have, and I remember watching the way she had talked with the other guy didn't even live up to a second of conversation we ever had. Being my drunk, confessional self I told her about my feelings and she was taken aback. Then I asked her if I was wrong, didn't she feel the same way? She said she did feel it last night with him, but she was with me and it would've been rude to just leave me. I told her that I could never be as good to her or work out with her the way he and her did, and told her to contact him in the morning or to flirt with him, and to forget me. We both feel asleep, and I woke up she was gone, and I secretly hope she took my advice.",2019-07-08 16:00:49,2,1,relationship_advice

Everything has been really great, we are super close, super similar and always having fun. The problem is lately she has more and more been expressing that she wants to get married and settle down, and I (although I want to do that eventually maybe in 4 or 5 years) am just not ready yet or soon, I need to get my career figured out, and I didn't get into the relationship with the expectation she would be the last girl I would ever be with. I've only hooked up with a few girls before this last year, and I feel like I would want way more experience before settling down. She has mentioned to me about 5 times a sarcastic line like ""if there's another girl just tell me and we can have an open relationship, you can fuck whoever, etc"". I knew she was sarcastic in these times. Once about a month ago she seriously suggested we do an open marriage. And then yesterday she asked if I would do an open relationship and I said yes if she wanted it. She got pissed after that, which I naively wasn't expecting, said things like I don't really love her and I was lying about that, its disgusting, she is disappointed, if i would let her have sex with another guy the day before we meet then I don't love her, etc. She was on her period so she said she needed to think about it. I think shes breaking up with me but I don't know but I'm going to video chat her later, any ideas what I can say? Is this even going to work out, everything else is great with our relationship its just this, but what about our different priorities should she find someone who is looking to settle down? If she was 5 years younger instead of 4 years older I think we would be able to wait more but I know she is feeling pressure to get married and have babies.

I only get 4 hours of supervised visitation every Saturday.,"I got my ex wife (24 F) pregnant our first semester in college. We got married since we had been together for 4 years all through high school. She dropped out the first year and our son was born in July that year.

I played football all 4 years in college. It took up a lot of my time. My wife worked two jobs and our moms helped to watch our son. I traveled with the team a lot so I was away. I went to the library to study in peace. 

Anyway she and I never had time together so we drifted apart. She was always busy with our son and we never had time together. She only ever wanted to talk about our son or her job.  I cheated on her. A lot. My senior year she said she wanted to have another baby since I was about to graduate and have a good job. 

I did something unforgivable. I gave her an STD that almost caused her to lose our daughter. She then divorced me. 

I admit all I've done with my kids is see them once in a while. I spent all my time dating around. One of my girlfriends fed my son peanut butter (he's allergic) so I only get 4 hours of visitation. 

I want to try to make things better with my kids and hoping it's not too late to fix things with my son. He hardly wants to talk to me. My daughter I've only seen a couple times. 

I need help trying to get my family together. I would like to be back with my ex she's a good person and a great mom.

 I am going to try and be as informational but anonymous as I can, to keep the confidentiality Intact. 
So I started working in an establishment in December, and when I came in, the environment was very supportive and helpful, I was able to be working and not care about building relationships and any other employees. Moreover, the other girls where territorial, they had their relationships and clics going on and seeing that a few guys where being extremely ""amicable"" towards me &amp; so was I in return, slowly started a passive aggressive feud between them and I, yet, I don't hold the same grudge against them, the only grudge that I hold is because of the poor treatment from the other girls. 

Now couple months in the girls have gravitated away from me, but I didn't care because the guys where supportive and nice with me. I fell into the trap of mixing working relationships and sexual relationships. 

The guy that I went for has many girls at work crushing over him, and he was chasing me in a way that flattered me because I felt special. He was nice, and played around. Then I slept with him not to have a BF gf thing, but to satisfy my need for sexual intimacy and I didn't want different treatment. What I ended up getting, however, was different treatment. However, in a way that is demeaning, to be ""lowkey"" he treated me more like shit, at work he would be even more distant, and cold compared to when he was first chasing me and playing around in the beginning.

 We no longer have any intimate relations, and this doesn't bother me because he's confusing me and this confusion is making me anxious and rather sad at work. This confusion is because he got what he wanted and is no longer seemingly interested in building anything and this really hurts. I let myself be vulnerable and let work be mixed in with personal. 

So now I go in to work very unmotivated and anxious. And this guy at work is my boss. Everytime I work with him I feel angry, upset, hurt, used and needing from him to be more compationate. What do I do I don't want to exactly quit, but I am unable to feel stability and avoid my feelings mentioned above. Thank you.

Edit: I thought I would be fine because he was telling to trust him, and I feel like he was grooming me from the start. I feel stupid that I got in this, so for the upcoming hate I know my decisions where not made logically.",2019-07-08 15:59:01,2,1,relationship_advice
159,camv07,fkthatwasunexpected,I (23M) can't stop thinking about this girl (22F) and I don't know what to do," 

Hey everyone! I know this is something stupid but its really affecting me.

I have this friend (22F) who's in my college class. We are very good friends and hang out every now and then (sometimes with more people and sometimes on our own). Weve been friends for 3 years and I have honestly never felt anything for her more than a friendship. She has been in different relationships in this past 3 years and I honestly didnt care much about it.

But this changed one month ago. I invited her and a few friends of mine to my house and we spend the night there, we had soooo much fun. Pretty much all my friends have a SO except me and 2 other guys. They were ""pressuring us"" (not really, id say in a jokey way) to date and stuff (My friends really like her for me). At first I didnt think anything about it but that night in bed I started thinking about how would i feel about having a relationship with her.

That was the turning point as I thought that id would be fantastic, we do pair very well and laugh so much together. We are almost best friends and Im sure that it would work out fantastic. She looks very atractive to me and shes single so. ""why do i not like her?"" i thought.

Ever since then (one month ago) I literally cant stop thinking about her. I want to spent time with her as much as I can and I stalk her in social media a lot (I have never done this before i feel ashamed) I am literally depressed all day because I really wanna date her and I know its not going to happen. I check my phone and Instagram every 5 minutes to check if shes posted something or messaged me. My mood depends on the last response shes given me. (This sounds brutal but its kinda true)

The thing is that I am 100% confident she doesnt want to have a sentimental relationship with me. We joke around A LOT about ""being a couple"" but she is nothing serious about it while I do sometimes say the truth LMAO. She knows nothing about my real feelings.

I will see her again today and probably tomorrow too. I dont know if I should stop hanging out with her, at least until the summer ends. This will be weird since we do see each other a lot, and I dont want to lose her friendship, she is an awesome person to be around and I learn a lot about her everyday.

She says im not ""friendzoned"" every time I jokingly bring that up but man I dont know. I am sure she feels nothing for me right now more than a friendship.

Then he grabbed the back of my neck and pushed me towards the knobs yelling which one was hot and cold. I kept laughing nervously and telling him to stop but it was starting to hurt.

We saw eachother on weekends because we live 1hr away and he has work and I have school.

I would always tell him to call me at night and talk for even like 20 minutes, but he started doing that less and less. He stopped giving me compliments, he stopped caring basically.

He said he wanted space and that he is bored. He said that we should take a break and I told him we should break up instead.

We broke up and then 2 days later he texted me telling me that he realized he loves me alot and that he was bored because of himself.  He promised me that from now on he will treat me better.

I love him alot but I told him that we should stay broken up because it's for the better and because we are not compatible.

We‚Äôve had a pretty positive relationship and have plans for the future... living together, we‚Äôve discussed marriage and kids. He definitely sees a future with me and I see one with him, but there are some red flags I‚Äôm worried about that could prevent us from continuing the relationship longterm. I love him and know this relationship has been the healthiest, most normal, most positive relationship I‚Äôve been in but I struggle sometimes with these issues: 

- Our communication styles are very different. Im talkative and I LOVE discussing each other‚Äôs lives , how our days went , and stay up to date on what we‚Äôre doing. He‚Äôs keeps to himself more... and doesn‚Äôt often bring up conversion or initiate in depth talks at all unless there is a really serious issue. When I do bring up topics, unless I preface that it‚Äôs serious he seems to half listen 80% of the time and seems distracted by other things. This makes me feel like he doesn‚Äôt care or that I‚Äôm an annoyance. 


- I enjoy physical touch, romance, and re assurance of his feelings OFTEN because I have anxiety and have been through some pretty negative relationships. I trust him 100% and know he would not be unfaithful or hurt me. He on the other hand is more distant and more sexual... So yes he‚Äôll give me a hug and peck when he gets home but besides that he‚Äôs not that touchy unless it‚Äôs time to get physical or we‚Äôre cuddling before bed time. On the other hand I want to cuddle on the couch, hold his hand when we‚Äôre out, and be clingy all the time when we‚Äôre together (2-4 days a week). Is this over the top? The rest of the week I‚Äôm at home on my own or working and do my own thing. 

- Our sex life. He has a higher drive and I have a medical condition that prevents me from having sex at times or going for more than a few minutes. It also always happens where when I‚Äôm good to go, we can‚Äôt make it happen because of timing or the setting. Im also unable to do his fave stuff because of my medical condition. I feel like we are really struggling in this dept and I don‚Äôt know what else to do but offering him foreplay... He enjoys it but I feel inadequate about 99% of the time because my condition prevents me and him from having a plentiful and enjoyable sex life and we can‚Äôt do what he really enjoys. He says he understands and is nice about this but then he‚Äôll make snarky jokes about it and doesn‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs a little hurtful until after it‚Äôs been joked about. 

- He doesn‚Äôt get excited to see me or doesn‚Äôt show that he is... I come over... he‚Äôs like ‚Äúhey, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù And will eventually give me a hug or kiss . But I want a more excited reaction/butterflies in my tummy reaction from him but it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm just another bro coming to hangout. 

- His best friend/roommate is always 3rd wheeling and we don‚Äôt do many dates alone anymore. We are generally in a group with his friends when we go out. Me on the other hand I have like 2 close friends and I‚Äôm a loner most of the time. He loves people around all the time and it‚Äôs exhausts me a bit.

Should I reach out and let them know I don't agree?,"Several years ago, my mom and aunt (her sister) had a falling out which led to them no longer speaking. While this did impact my relationship with this family, I chose to continue working on maintaining the relationship with my aunt, uncle, cousins, specifically my cousins. My sister has never put any effort into having/building/maintaining a relationship with them, so she doesn‚Äôt have one. (She expects them to reach out to her, she doesn‚Äôt feel she should have to put in any effort)

&amp;#x200B;

Her wedding is coming up and she sent them a save the date card. Apparently, she had an expectation that they would call or email her personally to congratulate her and because this didn‚Äôt happen, she decided to email them this week and uninvite them to the wedding.

&amp;#x200B;

This really was shocking to me - she didn‚Äôt uninvite everyone else who didn‚Äôt contact her with a personal congratulations, so why did my family members get uninvited? Especially because the wedding is 5 weeks when it happened.

&amp;#x200B;

I don‚Äôt want to get involved because this is between them and her, but I want my aunt/uncle/cousins to know her decisions don‚Äôt reflect me and that I don‚Äôt want her decisions to affect my relationship with them.

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be appropriate to reach out to them and say something to the affect of hey, I don‚Äôt want to butt into the middle of this, but I just want to make it clear that her decisions don‚Äôt represent me and I hope this doesn‚Äôt impact our relationship?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, how do I not let her actions impact me? She and I spoke about what she did before she did it. I was very clear I felt this was the wrong move, but she said she needed to do what's best for her. She's very close to her fiance's large family, so burning bridges with our family is an afterthought to her. Me, on the other hand, we have a very small family and I don't have a SO whose family I am very close to like she is, so this family means a lot to me. I explained this to her but she didn't care. How do I get rid of the resentment I feel toward her? And how do I act toward her?

Things have been going quite well, we get along great, I make her laugh, we have the same taste in comedy/music, etc. There is however, something that's been bugging me(not a whole lot, but my mind occasionally wanders);

The other night, she tells me that she came home to find her stuff on the front porch with a note telling her she can't live there anymore. I let her stay at my place for two nights while she gets her ducks in a row, but on the third day, whilst I was at work... she says she's at her house doing homework. How can that be if you've been kicked out? So they didn't throw your stuff out?

She is incredibly evasive about me coming to her house, where she lives with someone she advertised as gay. Told me the land lady doesn't want her bringing people over. The guy that lives there is the landlady's son so he is allowed to bring people over, if that's relevant. She claims to detest this person. Says he's an asshole, and it came out one time that he hit her.(Naturally that makes me want to kick his ass)

The way she guards her phone when she gets texts has also made me a little anxious. A lot of the time she tilts her phone away from me when looking at it, and turns it off if I walk over to her.(I do not snoop, have had opportunities to go through it but that's not how I operate) Yesterday she was showing me a picture she took at work and a text came up, ""Are you okay :("" from this guy she lives with. She swiped the text away real quick, stood up and walked away.

The day before yesterday we hung out and shot off some left over fireworks, but she left to pick this guy up from work as his car is fucked up. Why are you doing favors for this guy?

This morning she was looking at Facebook, ran across mine, said something like,""oh, you have a facebook?"" Didn't add me though which seemed a bit odd but not a big deal. I tried to look her up later and couldn't find her. Suppose it's on private mode.

I've been cheated on before so I'm a hyper sensitive to stuff like this. My question really is, am I just being paranoid?I mean, I 99% percent thought I was being paranoid until she gave the dude a ride. I'm not really sure how to approach this, just let it go or maybe start asking some questions?

Idk in this moment a conversation with him won‚Äôt help since we‚Äôve had so many but in a week or so I probably will, in the meantime what can I do to change our behaviors?

167,camrh0,Dry_Line,Settle an argument between me (24M) and my friend (25F) about dating,"Howdy Reddit 

&amp;#x200B;

We're looking for an impartial opinion on an argument we're having. For context, 24M was a bit of a slut growing up and has had a fair few relationships ect whereas 25F is a virgin, never had a boyfriend and has very VERY little social experience. We have very different perspectives on Dating &amp; relationships, for example 24M is a cynic and 25F is a romantic. 

&amp;#x200B;

The argument we're having is this: 25F's entire ""attraction"" is based off of a specific style (Skater/Surfer), with no other metrics whatsoever. No desirable personality traits. No desirable physical traits. No Education requirements, or income. Just their clothing style. She calls it a ""Fetish"". 25F is also a romantic and believes in ""The one"". 24M thinks that it's fucking ridiculous to expect to be able to find ""The One"", or the perfect partner simply by looking at what they're wearing, or if the ""The One"" even exists. He thinks that sort of mentality is what a teenager would have, and the reason she's thinking this way is due to her very very limited dating experience and it's really quite immature, people around their age shouldn't be dating like teenagers.

&amp;#x200B;

24M's point is that 25F should get out there and experience dating, a few different guys, a few different situations and then decide to settle down. Or at least be exposed to a different perspective other than her anime's. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you think Reddit, should 25F be looking outside of her obsession/is it healthy to have her mindset? Or is 24M allowing his bias &amp; cynicism to rule his point of view?",2019-07-08 15:51:07,2,2,relationship_advice
168,camrgo,Ihatetheirfiances,I'm 25M I hate my life because I'm a virgin still who's never had a girlfriend (20sF) I'm ugly fat and short and my life sucks cause hot women don't want me? Girl I have mixed feelings for who rejected and hurt me gets married soon I'm miserable over it,"**TL;DR**



I'm 25. I'm fat ugly amd short. never a girlfriend or kissed still a virgin and no attractive women like me. I have a horrible life because women like Ria Ciuffo don't want me. All my friends have attractive girlfriends and wives i want their lives. My life sucks every girl i liked has rejected me and friendzoned me and everybody tells me my league is fat ugly girls even my dad told me date ugly fat girls so my life sucks if i lose weight and still can't attract a good looking woman then i wasted my time I don't want to lose a hundred pounds just to have to end up dating an unattractive woman still or a woman who is hardly plain looking or average and its like all i am gonna hear is this 
""if you lose weight and don't get a hot girlfriend then I'm sorry but you gotta date the ugly ones and get use to it""


The girl i had feelings for in high school but who friendzoned me got married to a guy who cheated on her with a teacher She started dating him when me and her were seniors and he was a freshman he was caught sexting a teacher caught on the news and now the girl I want is marrying him and A TEACHER HERSELF 

She would use me as the shoulder to cry on and then when she was done crying to me she would have me go away and then she would go back to him after I'm not saying it wasn't my own fault but to some degree I was used emotionally

and now everybody is happy that they're getting married it's like I'm living in the Twilight Zone that people forget that he cheated on her with the teacher and got caught on the news. 

Then five years ago when my mom passed away everybody I knew gave me their condolences even people I didn't like but they still were decent enough to tell me their condolences all except her she didn't even give me a my condolences at the minimum despite her feeding me lies saying how me and her were such close good friends.

170,camqwp,anonymousanxious2,My (24F) GF left me (27M) after pre-meditated cheating (and lying about it) (2 1/2 yr relationship)," Not even sure where to start with this. Maybe the start. 2011. I was at a friend's 18th party, and had drank too much. I was later told that the girl that would become my girlfriend several years later had been the girl who had said 'we can't just leave him out here on his own, he's not OK'.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward five years and we start talking on Facebook - I'm a guy with anxiety, who's been through a mental breakdown over poor sleep since our initial meeting in 2011. I don't go out much. I decide to talk to her and meet up with her as friends. The circumstances are poor, as she is with someone at the time, but tells me he never spends any time with her, doesn't care about her, and the two are basically flatmates and that she's wanted the relationship over for some time. I proceed slowly, but develop feelings for my to-be partner over the next few weeks. We kiss in my car before I drop her off at her mother's house one night. She's still with her partner and tells me the two haven't had sex in months. A few days later we go on a night out together and stay at a friend's place, where we have sex for the first time on an air sprung mattress on his living room floor. She ends it with her partner the same morning. I warn her that I am someone with anxiety, but given that this is my first serious relationship, I had no idea what I was in for. I worried about practically every second she was away from me - worried that she'd do something silly. She fucked up, but I knew she was a loving, caring person, with a sweet face and a good heart.

&amp;#x200B;

The months pass by and I feel my life slowly getting in gear - I do everything with her, becoming dependent on her for enjoyment of my time. We live together at hers, then at her mum's, then we find a place of our own to rent, and begin to plan our future. She learns to drive with me, gets a new job, helps me with my work when I'm struggling, takes time off work for me if I'm unable to sleep as she knows where I've been with it. I slept like a baby while I was with her because she was there to comfort me. We're completely in love. We go away on holiday to Portugal together and ride around the beautiful back roads on a scooter while she holds me close. We were so happy. All this time, I've been making one big mistake - getting super anxious whenever she wants to see friends, or go out on a night out. I tell her I'm worried, and that I really need her to call me on the nights out - sometimes she does, sometimes she doesn't. If she doesn't we end up arguing when she's home. I tell her she doesn't care about the way I feel, that I just need her to call me to put my anxiety to bed. She tells me she's just having a good time with friends and can't always check her phone. We move house towards the end of last year, and around the same time I tell her I need her to come home one night she's out at her sister's, because I'm feeling really depressed and need her home. She doesn't call back for a while, then my mother messages her, then the two argue. My girlfriend comes home 5 hours later. She was 30 minutes from home.

&amp;#x200B;

On Christmas day of last year, she gets invited to her best friend's parent's house for dinner. I am not invited, and so we argue about this. She spends most of the day there in the knowledge that the way my sleep has worked out for the night, I'd be asleep until the evening and she wouldn't need to be back until then. I wake up early and ask her to come home because I miss her and it's Christmas day. We argue. She doesn't come home at all. She tells me the next morning she's leaving me. I beg her to stay - she's become so integral to my life and my happiness that I need her around, even if we are arguing a lot. I tell her I will be better for her. She stays. I set to work on myself and avoid fighting with her. In January we have a big fight over something I don't even remember - I push her in anger and feel immense guilt - she hurt her ankle on a night out a couple of months prior and so she was already in pain. I then promise not to ever do that again.

&amp;#x200B;

I then have surgery on my stomach to repair a hiatus hernia, and become dependent on her for a couple of weeks while I struggle to eat. She takes time off work to look after me. The following months we don't argue as much, I avoid asking her to call me when she's out with friends, and we are generally way happier. I then become absorbed in my work and spend a little less time with her for a couple of weeks. Then, she goes out with a friend, I slip up in an anxious moment, ask her to call me - she messages me instead - ask her to call me again, to which she replies that she's just fine. I panic and wonder why she won't call me. Things are tense now.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of weeks later we have an argument over money, where she has accrued a debt and failed to pay it. My things are in the house too, so I'm worried they'll be taken if she doesn't pay it. I offer to pay it, she declines. She won't tell me if she's dealt with it, if she's going to deal with it - she won't tell me anything. She ends the relationship with me, and I beg her to stay. This time, she's absolutely sure. I spend the next five days still living at the house, bouncing between mental states of anguish, anger, guilt, begging her to stay with me, putting more effort into us and trying to show her that I can improve. She tells me over and over she can't do it anymore. We have sex twice during this, but it's not the same loving sex we had previously - she wants to be punished. This makes me wonder if she's done something wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

While cleaning the house one day, I discover thongs, and sex toys purchased in the weeks prior. She tells me they're nothing, that she bought them for herself. I believe her. Then I get a second opinion from friends. They tell me there's something almost certainly going on. One night I check her phone, and my heart sinks. The morning she came home at 7AM and we argued, following the argument she unblocked someone she always told me was nobody on Facebook, and immediately started sexting. It was harrowing to read as it was really heavy BDSM sub/dom stuff - things I didn't even know my girlfriend liked. How could some guy, within 2 minutes of talking to my girlfriend know more about her sexual preferences than I did in nearly 3 years? They planned to meet, and they had sex during our relationship in a car park out of the back of this guy's Porsche. I felt absolutely devastated, and when I confronted her about it and told her I took pictures of the evidence, her only concern was not being exposed (I'd never do this - I still love her). I had asked her when she initially broke up with me if there was anyone else, and she'd started into my eyes - into my soul - and told me that there wasn't. Repeatedly.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the girl who understood my anxiety, helped me through some tough times, slept in bed with me at 4PM when I couldn't sleep, rode around Portugal on the back of a scooter with me, helped me with my work when I just couldn't do it - the girl I trusted completely, but admittedly still worried about. The girl who had said 2 years prior that she wanted my kids, to spend the rest of her life with me, that she would always love me. I am so, so broken. I wanted so badly to fix this.

&amp;#x200B;

To top things off, I'm back my parents' house, back at square one. Both of my best friends are leaving the country soon for good, and I have nobody else to fall back on. I don't want to work anymore. I don't have purpose anymore. I don't have anything to do any more. I lost my dog with the relationship. Our rented house. We did everything together and I loved her completely. I loved her quirks, and all I can remember is us laughing together. I feel like I can't replace her.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: GF I absolutely adored left me after getting sick of my anxiety and worry and lied about cheating on me.

172,camqir,burner50123456,I (23F) feel like I'm not being supportive of my boyfriend's (24M) life choices,"Posting on a burner account because my boyfriend knows my real account, sorry.

My boyfriend of 2 years currently attends a top 20 law school. He's been accepted into a top 5 law school and is debating transferring. This second law school is 20 hours away from where we currently are. He expects that I'll follow him to this new school. His reasoning for wanting to transfer is that he'll be able to get a job with a more prestigious firm if he graduates from the better school, and he won't have to worry about his class ranking as much (he's currently in the top 5).

We're serious about our relationship, we've talked about getting engaged soon and we were set to sign a lease together this month. I've put my grad school on hold because it's not really feasible for us right now financially or mentally. 

I'm really afraid of the prospect of having to move so far away. Both of our families are close to where we live currently, so we'd both be moving away from them. He knows a couple students from the school that he'd be transferring to, I don't know anyone from the area. I only have a bachelor's degree and getting the job I have currently took me a while, having to think about searching for a new job is making me nervous about whether or not I'll be able to find one. I'm not in a good financial position to make such a large move currently either. 

I've tried to be unbiased and not sway his decision one way or another. I am really proud of him for getting accepted into this top 5 school, but I was really proud of him when he got accepted into the top 20 school too so I was bound to be proud of him either way. Obviously I would prefer if he didn't move to the better school because it represents a large financial and emotional risk for me, but of course I would do it if that's what he decided was necessary. 

How can I articulate how I'm feeling without it sounding like I'm discouraging him from pursuing his dreams? Am I selfish for thinking that switching to this new school is going to be more trouble than it's worth? What should I do?

Thank you in advance for your advice.",2019-07-08 15:48:59,1,1,relationship_advice
173,camou8,authenticcutie,should I (18f) wait until after our trip to break up with my boyfriend (18m)?,"I'm going to try and keep this as short as possible cuz I know I hate reading paragraphs of unnecessary details. Not sure if I should be posting this to relationship advice, sorry if this is the wrong sub. 

My BF and I have been together for about a year and a half, though we did spend some time broken up during this time. Things are going mostly fine (we're getting along) but he doesn't seem to see me as a priority and doesnt make an effort to even see me. I've told him this before and we've talked about it but I see no difference in his actions, and I'm tired of staying in a relationship that doesnt even feel like a relationship. So I've decided I need to break up with him. 

The thing is, we have this trip planned with some of our friends in a little under 2 weeks. it's not a romantic trip, and we are all very excited for it. We cant reschedule or go independently of one another, and if I did break up with him chances are we'd both still want to go on this trip, it would just be hella awkward. 

I dont want to make things awkward by breaking up with him before the trip, even though I've already decided that's my course of action. But I'm worried that its disingenuous to act like everything is fine and dandy. I'm also worried that spending time with him acting like a couple will dissuade me from breaking up with him later, even though I know it's the best thing for me. 

tldr; would I be an asshole if I waited until after our trip to break up with my BF?",2019-07-08 15:45:30,6,1,relationship_advice
174,camocn,Taek3wondo,People tell me my family emotional abuses me and I don‚Äôt know how to feel about it. They tell me to leave but I feel guilty doing so.,"I‚Äôm writing this on mobile so I‚Äôm sorry for the formatting. But it all started in high school when I lost all my grandparents. I started with 4 going into my junior year and within 2 years they all passed away. This was very hard on my family, understandably. Now it is time for me to go to college about 9 hours away from home and I went with my brother. Things were going fine and I met this boy and we instantly hit it off and got along very well. 

Eventually after a little while we started dating, now my brother decides to tell my parents that he has done a bunch of different drugs and this makes me parents hate him (even 4 years later). From the loss of my grandparents I‚Äôm still going through and the change in environment, I did not do good my first semester at school and this makes my parents flip (understandably). But from then on whenever my parents would get mad at me it would turn into the silent treatment for weeks, as well as my mom telling me things like ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt apart of this family anymore.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou are disgusting, pathetic, and a loser.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe will never support you if you stay with him.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt ever gonna be proud of you.‚Äù 

And those things have been said to me over and over again for the past 4 years even though they both deny it has ever happened. After telling my dad that I wanted to move out, he would guilt me into staying through statements like ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt leave me with your mother and brother.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt walk out on family, they are everything you have.‚Äù And because of my dad I have not left yet. I have since this happened developed anxiety whenever I go home or whenever I think my parents are going to be mad at me because I am afraid to hear those words. 

Fast forward to about 2 weeks ago. I am moving in with my boyfriend during school until I graduate and I‚Äôve talked to them about this previously. Now my mom came out really drunk 2 weeks ago and started talking to me about it. This resulted in my mom locking me in my room with her and she refused to let me out until I started screaming and banging on my door. I don‚Äôt know what to do, they are my family and I love them but I don‚Äôt know how to handle all of this happening just because they don‚Äôt like my boyfriend.

178,cammse,idontlikeyou781,My (27F) boyfriend (28M) being so close to his ex makes me feel so insecure and I don‚Äôt know what to do.,"I‚Äôve been dating my boyfriend for about 4.5 months. He‚Äôs great and is funny and makes me so happy. But he is also really good friends with his ex, who he texts. They don‚Äôt text SUPER often and it‚Äôs mostly for a ‚Äúhey I need to pick something up‚Äù or ‚Äúhey, can you please do me a favor.‚Äù But it still makes me feel weird. 

A few weeks ago we were casually chatting on the phone and he mentions he‚Äôll be watching a friends dog while she‚Äôs away on vacation. I knew immediately that this friend was his ex of course but i didn‚Äôt push my discomfort at the idea of her stopping by the house, dropping off the dog, hanging out for a few hours alone with him, etc. 

The instance bothered me so much but I held my tongue. Yesterday though, I accidentally spotted her name on his texts. I didn‚Äôt read any of the text, just saw her name there. I couldn‚Äôt get that out of my mind and just couldn‚Äôt stop crying. Eventually I finally confronted him. 

I told him how uncomfortable the situation made me. He tried to show me the text (which I vehemently refused since I really don‚Äôt wanna be THAT girl).  I told him that seeing her name reminded me of the dog situation and that I kind of wish he gave me a heads up before making the decision of watching his dog. He says he feels he shouldn‚Äôt have had to ask permission for agreeing to watch his ex‚Äôs dog (and if I said no, he would‚Äôve done it anyway). He said it would have been fucked up if he didn‚Äôt tell me at all, but he did tell me. I told him that the method in which he mentioned it felt so...sneaky (bc he said friend instead of ex, like he was purposefully trying to avoid saying her name). 

The whole conversation left me in a mental hellhole. I feel like we came to no answer and a huge part of me regrets ever even bringing it up. I should‚Äôve let it eat away at me privately. But now he knows how I feel, he doesn‚Äôt agree with it AND I can‚Äôt stop replaying the part in my mind where he said even if he had to ask me and I said no, that he would‚Äôve done it anyway (I would never say no btw and I told him this). 

I‚Äôm so exhausted now and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel so sad and insecure. There‚Äôs a weird tension now and I don‚Äôt want it to ruin the relationship. But at the same time, this just makes me so uncomfortable. 

TLDR; I love my BF who I‚Äôve been dating for about 4.5 months but he is good friends with his ex. One specific instance left me feeling insecure. I confronted him but we resolved nothing. Now there‚Äôs a slight tension between us. And I am mentally fucked and don‚Äôt know what to do.",2019-07-08 15:40:51,12,1,relationship_advice

They have a son btw and he's 11. eversince we become a couple, we rented an apartment for us to both live. I have a permanent work, he doesn't have any. The problem is not that. The problem is that, I met some1 over social media, he pursue me, that's when i realized he was my co-worker after i accepted his request that was on and off on my notif because i never accept people i'm not familiar with. We chatted casually whenever i feel bored and it lasted for more than 6 months when we decided to meet in person, i don't know what got into me but the second time we meet, he tried to kiss me, i know it's wrong and told him we should stop whatever it is between us 'coz i know it's wrong.

180,camm9k,foregoneconclusion98,Was I (32M) the other man in the relationship with the woman (34F) had dated for three months?,"I just had a total mind-fuck dating experience. I went on 20+ dates with this woman, really liked her to a point I was ignoring red flags (dumb on me).

In three months and 20+ dates I was never invited over to her place, despite ""outside of her building"" being a common meeting place (she lives downtown) to start a date. 

My birthday came up, and she asked to take me to dinner and drinks for it. I met her downtown at 7pm, and she was already completely shit-faced to a level that I found embarrassing to be around, as a sober person. Within 20 minutes of sitting down at the restaurant I had to walk her home. I asked her (prying at this point) if I could take her dog out for her so she could rest, and if I could help her up there because she was 100% wasted. She pushed back and said no. 

Things started getting odd too as she started telling me the Bachelorette was her favorite show, and seemed to take it way more seriously than anyone I've ever seen before.

Texting her to set up a time we could hang out again I suggested we hang out at her place and that I want to see it (she lives in a luxury apartment downtown). She completely ignored that and suggested dinner and a movie near my place (I live about 30 minutes from her). Then, to kind of frustrate me further at dinner the waiter came by and she asked for one check, then had me pay it. This was after royally screwing up my birthday (which she invited me out for). After this date I finally asked ""Where is this going?""

Her response was ""I don't know. I'm seeing you and one other guy. I've been seeing him about 3 weeks longer than I've been seeing you. I wanted to talk to you about this tonight but then we started having a good time so it didn't feel right to bring it up.""

We set up a time to ""talk about things"" the next Sunday, which I had set in my mind I should just end things at this point. I'd been hurt multiple times by this person who I was infatuated with. She beat me to the punch and ended things pretty abruptly herself though saying she ""was further along with the other guy"". 

What I'm really curious about is that nothing with this woman makes sense. I couldn't get any answers from her about any of this. She's incredibly vague and guarded. Like she wouldn't even give me her email address or accept my facebook friend request while we were dating. Or linkedin for that matter. I feel like maybe she had a boyfriend this whole time, and just told me it was a guy she met very shortly before me to try and save face a bit. I'm wondering what the general opinion of redditors is because I'm at a loss. I know it doesn't matter at this point, but I still feel like I deserve some answers.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: 

Woman I dated for 3 months (20+ dates) was kinda sketch, said she was simultaneously dating me and another guy, never invited me over or gave me much information about herself. I am curious if the general public thinks she was actually in a committed relationship, and I was just her ""side guy""",2019-07-08 15:39:43,4,1,relationship_advice

Last night I stayed up literally all night to talk to her about our problems and I found out the problem is me. I'm honestly not mad, I'm actually genuinely proud of her for stepping up and putting her foot down and letting me know I wasn't actually doing enough and that I hurt her too. 

I didn't react well to part of the talk (that was extremely important to her) because I'm incredibly emotional about it all and what we were talking about had hurt me in the past too. She told me I put a lot on her and I made her feel like the bad guy which was never my intention, and I apologized profusely for my actions. I know I can't go back in the past and take it all back and I know an I'm sorry isn't going to magically fix everything. She told me she would give me a second chance and explained I also wasn't supporting her 100% like I used too maybe? and I'm stuck.

I love her more than I love anything in this world. She is my metaphorical light at the end of the tunnel and I know I have a lot of issues and she told me she understands but she can't always be patient and understanding. (I have a SEVERE problem with not opening up and bottling up every problem due to past relationships and experiences and it's been greatly affecting us as of late.) I'm working on some of the issues I knew about and she was very adamant on repeating the fact that I need to communicate fully with her and also learn how to give her the support she needs. 

I want to give that to her, but I'm so clueless where to begin. I listen to her, I feel sympathy for the things she goes through, and I always give her an open space to talk but that's not enough? I don't know. I'm worried I'm just not gonna do the best and fuck I reaaaaally want to do my best for her. She fucking deserves it and eijdekkd knowing I was one of the people who hurt her... it's really fucking me up. It won't be a problem because obviously I need to own up but I need help Reddit. 

How do I give her the support she needs and wants? What should I do more of/less of? How do I show her that I'm actually willing to work on our problems?

Things have changed, and they've been changing for awhile now. I can't remember the last day I wasn't yelled at for something stupid, something I did 'wrong', something I didn't do his way, something I forgot. 

We used to be able to talk about anything, and talk through any problem, but that is a thing of the past. 

He used to listen when I spoke, but now He tells me to shut up and just listen to him. He always knows better because he's had a 'harder' life and has 'more life experience'. 

He tells me I need to be more submissive, Where did this come from? 

&amp;#x200B;

I blame the Meth use, he blames me... for everything. The truth is probably somewhere in between. I don't know how to help him, and he's been resentful to everything I've tried. Everything wrong in his life is somehow my fault. 

I used to think it was just the drugs talking, but I'm not so sure anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

At what point do you give up and pull yourself out of the black hole?

Do you give up on someone if you still see the glimmer of hope? Am I stupid for wanting to keep trying? Wanting the person I fell in love with back? Was it all just a lie?

185,camjoz,Freyja565,I'm (23 F) in love with my boyfriend's (M 30) friend (M 27),"Hello, everyone. I never expected I would be in this situation. My boyfriend and I have been together for 1 1/2 years. He was with me and comforted me through the loss of a beloved family member and we've been through a lot together. The problem is, he's not the man I thought he was. He has no drive in his life. He tells me hes going to do something and he doesn't do it. He lives in filth. His grandpa still pays his phone bill. He cannot go a single sentence without making a joke. He won't stand up for himself when people screw him over. He bounces from one interest to another like nothing. He gets good at one thing and then thinks he can do it all. He won't go grocery shopping so I live off whatever I can bring from home when I visit him.

The cracks of the relationship really started showing on my end when I had to clean his house while he slept all day. I became so distressed and in need to leave the house that I contacted one of our mutual friends to come get me. He came and we sat at his house and i vented my frustrations to him. We've always gotten along very well. We finish each other's thoughts and sentences. We're always laughing together. I've always had a little crush on him but with each passing hour of us laughing about ""Hey I was going to say that!"" I realized that the man of my dreams has been right under me.

Another blow to my relationship came when I found out my boyfriend lied to me about the number of people hes been with. At the beginning he told me 20. Then I asked his friends and their jaws hit the floor. ""Uh. He didn't tell you?? You know he's slept with over 100 people, right??"" Then I asked my boyfriend a year and a half into the relationship. ""Uh.. high 30s? Low 40s?"" His answer is always changing. 

I feel trapped because my parents love him. I love my boyfriend's family. But I dont love my boyfriend. I love his friend and his friend just confessed that he has feelings for me as well. I feel like a horrible person. My boyfriend and his family have done so much for me. But the spark is gone and I cannot change him. I cannot make him more responsible.",2019-07-08 15:34:10,10,1,relationship_advice
186,camj4v,rhetesa,My (20f) little brother(8) has autism but my mom (50) and stepdad (55) refuse to get him the help he needs,"My mom and my stepdad had my youngest brother when I was 12 and my oldest younger brother was 10. He is now 8 years old and everybody in my family thinks he is autistic. Yet my parents do not acknowledge this or refuse to admit it.  

His interests are very obscure. (For example he got SUPER into his vacation bible school program and started creating his own) He is overweight, has no friends in school, constantly acts out and does not act his age. But he is also very smart. He got into the gifted program in his school, yet at home he watches tv shows that are targeted towards 4 year olds. My parents see nothing wrong with any of these things. To make things worse my parents BOTH are teachers in elementary schools and have spent their whole careers interacting with all kinds of children. 

I have a cousin who is slightly younger than my little brother and whenever I see him I am literally left speechless with how different they are. My cousin is a normal little kid, a little person as you will. And my younger brother is just....not. I started noticing these differences years ago and just assumed my little brother would grown out of them and mature, but he hasn‚Äôt.

My grandma took me and my oldest younger brother (now 18) out for lunch a few months ago and admitted to us that she thinks something is wrong with my brother. She told us that the whole family believes he is autistic. My aunt who works in special education has notices signs of autism, yet somehow my parents refuse to see it. My grandmother doesn‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs her place to say something to my mom (her daughter) and she believes that it is my stepdad who is reluctant to get my little brother the help he so clearly needs. 

My mom has been an amazing supportive parent to both me and my brother. She has gotten me mental help when I needed it and just wants the best for me, and is willing to go great lengths for that. It horrifies me that me or my brother could have had autism and she didn‚Äôt act on it. It‚Äôs unfair that my youngest brother isn‚Äôt getting the help he so clearly needs, when I know me or my older brother probably would have. 

I think the root of the problem is my stepdad. He is a horrible lazy parent and him and my mom are much older than other parents my brothers age. I have no relationship with him, but the past few times I‚Äôve come home from college I‚Äôve brought up having my brother tested to my mom. Every time she tells me not so worry about it, as it‚Äôs not my problem. But I hate coming home and seeing my brother suffer through a life that could be better. 

I understand autism is on a spectrum, and I love my little brother so much it‚Äôs so painful to see him not be normal. Growing up I had my brother around to play with but my littlest brother has nobody. My parents aren‚Äôt good parents to him, have a hard time with discipline and give him minimal attention and I think it‚Äôs because my stepdad is in denial about all of it. Any advice is welcome. I don‚Äôt know what else to do because I‚Äôve expressed all of this to my mom before yet nothing has changed.",2019-07-08 15:32:59,1,1,relationship_advice
187,camita,lukewarmbreakfast,Is it my (27F) anxiety or my relationship?,"Alright, this might get lengthy, so I'll get try to keep it to the point.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past month or so, I have been struggling with some MAJOR anxiety issues, and I can't determine if this is something that is stemming from myself/ negativity/ depression, or if it TRULY coming from my relationship with T (24F).

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory about me:

I have always been struggled with anxiety for as long as I can remember. Not really a lot of panic attacks, but just very generalized ""what if this happens"" knot-in-your-stomach type anxiety. Not a SUPER confident dude, but generally am aware of my value/ what I bring to the table. Definitely a perfectionist. I also grew up with an alcoholic father, who passed 4 years ago due to an accident involving drinking. Spent 3 years in therapy from that, learned a lot about myself, made a lot of progress.

&amp;#x200B;

So a few months ago I met T. She is VERY self-aware and emotionally mature, she too is in therapy for generalized anxiety, and some past issues, nothing too terrible, but again, she was aware that some past things were affecting her day-to-day, so super cool that she was aware enough to reach out for help.

I was in a good job, dream company, with good pay, but a terrible manager. I was doing what I loved, for a company I loved, getting to know a super cool girl who has a good head on her shoulders, likes memes (big green flag), super creative, life was good.

Long story short: the company randomly  fired me for being ""too creative for your position"" (not even joking, that's a whole other story). They gave me two weeks severance. I moved back in with my mom temporarily. Confidence definitely took a hit.

I was fired in late March of this year. After about a month of job searching, I said fuck it, I'll roll the dice and move across the state to where my brother and sister are, and closer to where T lives. It's a thriving ""hip"" town, where I figured I could put my creativity to work (wedding photographer on the side). So I packed up all my stuff, made the move out here, and decided to try to grow my small photography business. I figured worst case, the job market is thriving out here as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to a month ago: photography business has not caught on like I imagined it would. Money isn't coming in like I imagined. I have interviewed for several jobs, and been picked over. I am feeling like a failure. My friends are 3 hours away. My brother and sister are here, but they are typically super busy. I just feel generally like crap, not a lot of confidence. Worried about money (still have a lot of savings/ not like I'll be on the streets for awhile, not that T would even let that happen).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why I wrote the post:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm noticing how agitated I am, especially in this relationship. I can feel myself being anxious when she is around, I'm not entirely sure why. She is very loving and affectionate, and I feel like I'm not reciprocating enough, so I feel guilty. I get agitated easily with her. She tells me how much she cares about me and all these nice thing, and I just can't bring myself to reciprocate at that level. I'm doubting this relationship, and not really sure why. I feel like I am taking what I am feeling and accusing the relationship/her of it. I am taking mistakes she has made in our relationship (she lied to me once, about alcohol, for fear of hurting my feelings/ she immediately owned up to it and admitted it was inappropriate and inconsiderate, we worked through it) and feel like I am using those things as reasoning that I should leave.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm worried that I am looking for reason to blame her for what I'm feeling. I know it's easier to blame others. I know Reddit might light me up on here for that. I'm just terrified that my brain is telling me ""*your relationship is making you unhappy, if you just leave, THEN you'll be happy/ less stressed*"". Maybe I'm just having a harder time challenging negative thoughts? Idk Idk Idk.

&amp;#x200B;

I should note that these thoughts are in my head, and I haven't told her that I'm questioning anything, because I feel its MY responsibility to figure out what I'm feeling first, and not spook her if it's not necessary. She is so sweet and supportive, I just feel like I'm looking or things to be angry about at this point and I hate that I'm doing that.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm wondering if anyone else **has been in a similar position?** Like, things are going shitty in other aspects of your life, so you question your relationship. I'm having a hard time filtering the thoughts and conspiracies. Am I an asshole? Is this normal-ish?

189,caminl,WhyFi,Am I (f45) in the wrong for wanting less time together than my boyfriend (48m)?,"My bf (48m) lives almost an hour away. We are both very busy people with our chosen hobbies and lifestyles. I feel like I am becoming resentful towards him because he is taking up my days off every week. I am a mother of a teenager who deserves my time and I hike and do coffee and the like with my girlfriends often. He is constantly looking for openings to come be with me which may sound very nice, but it is making me feel like he is putting too many demands on me. 

Ideally, I would like to see him maybe once a week for a few of hours for coffee or a date and perhaps an overnight every couple of weeks. When we first started dating a couple of years ago, he was fine with this arrangement. However, as time has gone along, he seems to be wanting more and more time together. Am I in the wrong for wanting to continue our original arrangement? I've brought this up to him and he says he understands and wants to respect my need for space but he continually calls acting sad that he is not able to see me every other day or so. 

Just as a small example, I have to take my car to the service center, my son to two band practices, and have a ton of chores to do in the next couple of days.

190,camihg,XYZ_Hater,"I (27m) Want to Know if I've Been Friendzoned by This Girl (27F), I like.","First, I'd like to say, I'm not the kind of guy to read into things. If I like a girl, I'll let her know/grab her number and ask her on a date as soon as possible. This has *never* failed for me when it's up close and personal. But it's kind of weird since it's all online.

So me (27m) and this girl (27f) are talking online. It's been about 2 weeks now, and we're separated by about 2 countries over the waters. She's kind of odd and quirky, says she's only ever dated 1 guy a long time ago (unsure sure about hookups, but, I've had my fair share of those, tbh).

Anyways, we've been talking over text and whatnot, but for some reason, the conversation has gone a bit like this:

* shared interests
* goals
* things you wanna do
* **talking about her/my problems**

Like I said, I don't read into things, but I think you and know where this conversation is going. From what I've seen online, and what I know, this usually isn't a good thing. Before anything though, I have already made my *romantic* intentions real clear in the *beginning*, and have already asked to meet up, to which she replied, *""Yes, but we would have to get to know each other more first.""* I dunno if she's just scared that I'm gonna kill her or something (who knows, maybe), but yeah I really don't waste time idling around.

I actually kind of like this girl. A lot. Her personality is just right. And, so, that brings me to here, reading into everything now, lol. I like her *a lot,* and I dunno, just clicked 0-100% for some reason. It's probably her personality. I guess, the problem lies in the you know what, **friendzone**. Usually if a girl has no interest in me, I'll move on, no problem; I'm not the kind of person to hang around and hope for something, months/years down the road. It simply isn't worth my time.

So, I kinda thought we were kinda like at least internet/online friends (we text a shit ton each day, long thick paragraphs/essays), but she still refers to me as a ""stranger"" for some reason and not a friend. We talked a little bit about relationships, and she asked why I haven't found the perfect girl yet since I'm so ""**nice""** (uh oh),"" to which I replied ""*XYZ*."" Please don't group me with other *nice guy* people you see online (unless you want to), I volunteer at orphanages and help children a lot, and don't actually ask for anything in return, which is why she called me nice.

So, then, I asked her the same question, and she said that ""she wanted a guy who doesn't want *temporary*? *(what)* things in life and wants to find someone who is *genuinely* interested in her."" *Well, hello there, I'm looking right at you.* Real talk, I'm kinda puzzled at where I stand, though.

I actually was going to ask how what she thinks of me right now, and see where it goes from there. What do ya'll think? Any tips or advice?

She always tells me she loves me and misses me but within the past 4 months or so I have become very distant and pretty much a wall to anything affectionate or nice she says to.

193,camhhi,KingoftheYellowHouse,Husband [25M] disappeared emotionally,"From the day I met him, my would-be husband Mikey amazed me. He was my idea of the perfect guy - intellectually curious, funny on many different levels and tuned into the world around him without being overly obsessive on a regular basis. In our first year of dating, there were only two mini fights and both times he wrote me sincere apology cards. I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs something I expect out of someone every time we have a tiff, but it was definitely something I appreciated. We were once talking about how couples fight and he said, ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do that to someone I love,‚Äù and then he clarified, ‚ÄúWhen you love someone, you treat them better.‚Äù Honest-to-goodness, a little light went off in my head that I didn‚Äôt even know existed that said ‚Äúùô∫ùô¥ùô¥ùôøùô¥ùöÅ!‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt mind his imperfections. Ok, his clothes are wrinkled and he farts a lot. It did (and does) not matter that his blood is not blue or that a white-collar office job was not in his future. I didn‚Äôt care that he was facing criminal charges or prison time. I loved him. And I still do. 

He did go to prison. Our relationship stayed strong and I prepared myself to be the provider when he got out. I didn‚Äôt know what his options would really be when he got out, but I wanted to do everything I could to ensure that we had a good life after.

We got married less than two months after his release. It‚Äôs been two years and I feel like I‚Äôve lost him completely. He is never affectionate or sexual - I don‚Äôt want to get graphic, but I looked it up and it hits the threshold for being considered asexual. We kiss a few times a week and we‚Äôve made our maybe 6 times since getting married. He never wants to have two-way conversations with me; It‚Äôs all venting about his world and his problems. I have to repeat things over and over to him, and he still only grasps the general words I used, not the idea I attempted to express. He gets mad easily and just storms off. We never just shoot the breeze any more. Half the time that I say something to him, he just ignores me. 

I can be a massive jerk - I want to be completely honest about that. But he used to acknowledge my point and comfort me to calm me down. (I do realize that makes me sound awful, but I think we should all support our loved ones. I really do have a good heart/moral system.) Now he hurls insults back at me. And even worse, he had started repeating the insults that I have told him that other people have hurt me deeply with. I would almost call it blatant gaslighting, but I really don‚Äôt know if he realizes what he‚Äôs doing. He gets out of control and *if* he apologizes, it‚Äôs half-hearted. Which ok, I get it, you‚Äôre not sorry. But can I at least get an explanation why you‚Äôre not sorry? Why is it ok to hurt my feelings, particularly with the most cutting of phrases? Because I‚Äôm sensitive? If this were a soap opera, it would be because he doesn‚Äôt love me any more. But he cried when I said I was leaving, so that doesn‚Äôt make sense. 

I apologize for the rant, but I am tired of begging him to notice me. He promises things will change, but they never do, and when I say something, it turns into a fight. I know what you‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄúùëÆùíäùíìùíç, ùíâùíÜ'ùíî ùíÑùíâùíÜùíÇùíïùíäùíèùíà ùíêùíè ùíöùíêùíñ,"" but I really don‚Äôt think so. He is on his phone a lot, but it‚Äôs always stupidly addicting games. He works six days a week and comes home dirty as a mole, so I really can‚Äôt imagine anyone wanting to have an affair with someone in that condition. I mean, based on what I learned of prostitutes from Super Freakonomics, I feel like even a pro would charge extra for someone in that state. Also none of his clothes ever smell like sex or even anything suspicious and I do almost all of his laundry, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to assume that he‚Äôs stepping out. 

I think the problem is me. I feel like (forgive the hippie metaphor) when he went to prison, all his ‚Äúlight‚Äù got trapped and twisted inside him. I truly believe it‚Äôs still there and I will always love him. But I don‚Äôt know what to do to support him at this time and I honestly feel like I‚Äôm the only one checked-in to this marriage. How do I get him to check-in? How do I help him to release his tension? How do I offer him help without sounding patronizing? 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Sorry it‚Äôs so mumbly rumbly. It‚Äôs just eating away at me and my therapist doesn‚Äôt realize that I don‚Äôt see my husband as the ‚Äúbad guy,‚Äù so I don‚Äôt want to talk trash on him. I just want us to get our happily ever after.",2019-07-08 15:29:15,1,1,relationship_advice
194,camh6f,imahugefuckup32,My ex [22F] left me [26M] after 3.5 years and I'm struggling with how to process and move forward,"My girlfriend was the light of my life and we had an amazing time together but she fell out of love with me because quite frankly I had some toxic behaviours that were affecting her negatively and it wasn't healthy for her. I completely understand this and I don't hold it against her.

The problem is she was far more than just my girlfriend. She was my best friend, and it feels like I've not only broken up, but I've also lost my best friend too. I feel like I'm grieving because she's died. And because of all that, I don't know how to process through this. This is only my second relationship and in my first I ended it because she cheated so it was easy to get through it because all the anger and hatred in my head was directed at her (don't worry, it stayed in my head). 

But this breakup, she's done nothing wrong. There's no sadness or anger to direct at her, it's all directed at myself. I'm the one who screwed it up, I'm the one that ruined a wonderful thing. All I can think about day in day out is that I'm a horrible person, thinking of all the horrible things I did. And I feel like I'm spirraling out of control because I can't see myself being with anyone but her. Anyone else would be settling. I was so worried about losing her to someone else, I lost her to myself. 

How do I move forward from this? How do I heal? I really don't want to lose her as a friend as well but I feel like if I don't start moving forward she will cut contact with me completely.",2019-07-08 15:28:31,3,2,relationship_advice
195,camgy1,marblearch12,I [20 M] don't think I love my girlfriend [20 F] anymore (not sure if I ever did). It's eating me up from the inside and I have no idea what I can do about this. Any advice would help.,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for the past two years and on the surface, everything is perfect. Problem is, I'm not sure if I love my girlfriend and it's really eating me up. I've been having trouble sleeping because of this for the past month.  When I told one of my best friends (also a close friend of my girlfriend) about this, he was absolutely shocked and told me that he would have never expected anything like this.

I've known my girlfriend since childhood but we didn't start dating until our last semester in high school and we've been maintaining our relationship throughout college so far. We didn't go to the same college but we were only a couple hours   away from each other, so we were able to meet up regularly. But now I'm moving to the East Coast and I haven't seen her in about a month or two. Being away from her and having all this time to spend on my own has really given me time to think about our relationship and I really don't know how I can work this out. 

We rarely fight and whenever we disagree about something, we always try to have a conversation about it. I really enjoy the time I spend with her but I always felt like something was lacking. She is so sweet to me and cares for me a lot and I care for her a lot as well and I don't think I could ever do anything that could hurt her but I think I might be going down that path. 

I think I first noticed these feelings right when we started dating. I just wasn't sure if I had made the right decision. When we moved to college, we would always be calling but it always felt more like an obligation to have her on the phone all day long. I could never turn her down because I was too afraid that I would hurt her feelings or make her think that I didn't want to spend time with her. It always felt like her priority was me and she wasn't mine. Whenever she told me that she loved me, I felt hesitant to say it back but it soon became more of  a habit and I would say it without hesitation . 

When we waved goodbye as I was leaving, she was almost in tears but I didn't feel anything. It's been about a month since I haven't seen her and all I can say is that I don't really miss her. I've been adjusting to my new environment and meeting new people so I've been keeping myself pretty busy so our average call time per day has dropped from about 2\~3 hours a day to 30 minutes. She feels sad that we aren't talking as much but I've honestly been enjoying the all this free time I've not been getting for a while. Whenever she tells me that she loves me I feel guilty to say it back but I still do because I don't want her to get hurt.

Honestly, I feel terribly lost. I've been drinking, smoking, or taking melatonin pills to help me fall asleep. The worst part about this is that she has done absolutely nothing wrong. She tells me that I make her want to become a better person. She loves me and cares for me like no one else and I know if I show the slightest hints of me feeling this way, she will be heartbroken. What can I do?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this is badly written. I can't seem to think straight these days. Thank you so much if you made it this far.

196,camg2i,underwinterfox,How to deal with a jealous gf(50F) of a close colleague(30M) of mine(23F)?,"So a colleague of mine named Dylan, has a 50 y/o girlfriend. I'm an attractive and fit girl. Dylan and I have been colleagues for a year now, and his girlfriend, Mary, has always been jealous of me since day 1.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Dylan's stories, Mary is very insecure and controlling. Dylan and I are very close, I go to lunch and short breaks with him. The reason for that is because we almost always have the same schedule. I do not find him attractive at all, but he's a really good friend and gives me pieces of advice. Sometimes we talk on social media strictly for relationship advice, or work issues only. His girlfriend doesn't seem to happy with me being with him all the time despite her having access to almost every account Dylan has. She reads Dylan's every message and they live together.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes, when I take a leave from work I ask Dylan through social media about work and the schedule, but it seems like his wife has chosen to ""ignore messages"" our conversation on messenger, and that means he's not gonna be notified when I message him, or she will know if he chooses to reply to me. I've met Mary once during an office party, and we've also talked as well when I wanted advice for my relationship issue. During our lunch, Dylan would always talk to her on the phone until our lunch ends, and I cannot make any noises or talk to him or Mary would find out I'm with him. I find this really pathetic and ridiculous. Why can't a man be free to be friends with his colleagues?

How do I deal with this though?",2019-07-08 15:26:03,10,0,relationship_advice

198,camegn,Plainas_Tay,(24/F) My therapist keeps cancelling on me,"For background, I started seeing a therapist/counselor in 2015. I never wanted to talk to someone, but ended up really liking my therapist so I kept going, and it helped. We got to a point where I was seeing her ""as needed"" and eventually not at all. 

In 2017 I decided to talk to someone again but unfortunately my previous therapist had moved and stopped taking clients. She referred me to my current therapist.  


At first, things went well. But after a while, I started noticing that my therapist was cancelling on me quite a bit. Then, we'd have to reschedule around already booked clients, so I was having a super sporadic and spaced out schedule with seeing her, and it wasn't helping me progress. 

On April 3rd, I sent her the message ""I don't know if meeting once a month from the constant rescheduling is good for me or my situation"". She replied that she was very sorry, understood, and would schedule me ahead of time for the next couple of months to make sure I was on a more regular schedule.

On June 18th, she said that she needed an emergency root canal and had to cancel our appointment. I said that it was fine and she replied that she would ""Text me soon to reschedule"".   
I deliberately did not text her first, because I wanted to see if she would hold to her word. She did not text me until today, asking if I wanted to make an appointment for next week. I haven't replied yet. 

I have a couple thoughts here that I need advice on:

Should I continue seeing her if she's so inconsistent?

Am I overreacting and/or just being petty about this?

Part of me thinks I should find another therapist. Another (larger) part of me doesn't think I would task myself with the challenge. My trauma/past is lengthy and the process of me having to bring another therapist up to speed bothers me. I don't want to relive through it all yet again. 

Or do I say something yet again? And if so, what do I say? I feel rejected by my own therapist who I pay to like me...",2019-07-08 15:22:38,2,1,relationship_advice
199,came9k,PaleForces,What‚Äôs the best way to resolve my current situation without seeming needy?,"Long story as short as I can put it, I met a nice girl while studying abroad (NOT a foreigner, she was in my group) and we hung out the entire trip. Five days before the trip ended, she told me she had a boyfriend and things weren't going well with him. That same night, we cuddled until morning. Mistake, of course. We talked about it the next night and she verbally confirmed that our feelings are mutual, but said she sees me as a best friend and doesn't want to lose me, thus, doesn't want to date. 

The thing is, we are still doing things that people who are dating would do. Right before the trip ended, we decided to send a song to each other everyday. She told me over the phone that she broke up with her boyfriend. We talk on the phone once a week. (We live in different states over the summer but go to the same college) But there are times when it feels like things are hot and times where things feel cold. For the first three weeks after the trip ended, she seemed really interested in texting me, but now I've noticed that I'm the one initiating the majority of our conversations, and her texts are much shorter. Our phone conversations seem bleaker since it's harder to keep the conversation flowing. 

I don't really know what to do at this point. I don't want to push something when it seems like she is losing interest, but I also don't want to come off as needy by asking her about this. I would stop texting her everyday but it's impossible since we agreed to send a song to each other everyday. Although we send a song to each other daily, all other communications through text have died. I really enjoy spending time with her in person, but it's difficult to communicate in a meaningful way over any type of digital communication, and there's still two more months until we're back at college.

My only question is: Should I talk to her about this, or would that make me seem needy? If yes, what's the best way to communicate this to her?",2019-07-08 15:22:12,1,1,relationship_advice
200,camd1f,ac__2020,Weed vs Fianc√©,"Very confused at the moment but will attempt to make this clear and straightforward. 

My fianc√© (26) and I (25 - today) (we are girls) have been engaged a little over a year now. When we first got together we would smoke once in a while together, I liked that cause she was really cool to smoke with. I don‚Äôt smoke a lot when we do, 2 hits out of a bowl max. For a while now she‚Äôs expressed she doesn‚Äôt like me smoking cause she thinks I look stupid, which I‚Äôm not disagreeing with. I feel I‚Äôve been respectful toward her feelings but she also knows I do enjoy smoking from time to time. I‚Äôve cut back a lot which I‚Äôm grateful for cause I didn‚Äôt like the way I was heading either. I used to smoke everyday, mainly for anxiety either way I knew and know it was not an attractive habit. Nonetheless I do enjoy it now from time to time. She confuses me at times because she will smoke with me at times even now but anytime I smoke alone it‚Äôs a huge deal and she gets mad and storms off even if she says for me to go ahead. I‚Äôll also never smoke if she‚Äôs uncomfortable with it or asks me not to. 

Yesterday we were at her dads house and he invited me out to smoke (first time ever) and so I accepted, she was in the shower during this time. She‚Äôs very upset about it, saying maybe her Dad was trying to ‚Äútest‚Äù me. To be honest, I thought he was being cool and I didn‚Äôt think she would have gotten so mad about it because it‚Äôs her Dad. Today is my birthday we had plans but obviously everything went downhill after the smoke with her Dad.

I tried to get her to talk about it earlier, she did, she‚Äôs angry mostly saying it‚Äôs not the kind of person she wants to be with. Which I understand and don‚Äôt want her to feel forced to stay. Toward the end of the conversation she says we are over. 

Idk what to do at this point. I wanna be with her but at the same time, it‚Äôs almost frustrating that she gets so upset every time. I feel sometimes like she‚Äôs parenting me. Cause right now all I wanna do is go smoke and be alone if she‚Äôs really done, that‚Äôs me just being honest. 

Any advise would be really appreciated.

(Would like to add that I‚Äôm not a typical ‚Äústoner‚Äù, I have a good job working in IT at a good financial institution. I have my bachelors in computer science. I just bought my first brand new home 8 months ago. I have my own car. I take care of most of our financial costs. I do not sit on my ass at home all day and smoke.

204,camci7,jmickk84,How to tell my roommate I‚Äôm taking our two cats when I move out,"Sorry this got long, I ended up ranting a lot lol

Background: My roommate and I live in a small apartment with 2 other college girls in a big city. We don‚Äôt have any sort of backyard or extra space, and we‚Äôre both working full time college students. (especially my roommate, who works every single day and is usually gone all day). Earlier in the year my roommate went through a phase where she was insistent that we get a pet for the apartment. Initially she was dead set on getting a husky and I tried to politely tell her that was the worst idea I‚Äôve ever heard. Our other two roommates are also super clean and neat and would HATE having a huge dog around in our small apartment with nowhere to run around. And I knew I would be the one stuck cleaning up all the hair and dog shit because my roommate is literally gone all day. But my roommate still went and made an offer to the breeder on facebook (without telling anyone first) and thank GOD someone else made a better offer and it didn‚Äôt work out. 

So instead, my roommate reached out to a facebook breeder that was selling baby kittens. I‚Äôm fine with cats even though I‚Äôm allergic (out of the 4 roommates, my roommate is the only one who conveniently isn‚Äôt allergic. Lol) and thought it would be significantly easier to deal with them versus a large dog. So the breeder agreed to sell my roommate 2 kittens, and she asked me if I could pick them up that night because she would be working (as usual). So me and my boyfriend drove a total of THREE HOURS to pick up these 2 kittens that my roommate had wanted, and I was a good sport about it, even though it used so much gas and I ended up with cat shit and piss in my car.  However, we survived the trip and introduced the kittens to their new home. 

I was under the impression that since both of us had paid for the cats (we each paid half), we would both be taking care of them. My room is the master bedroom that is upstairs and the other 3 bedrooms are smaller and downstairs, so the cats spent most of the time upstairs in my room, because the other two roommates aren‚Äôt a huge fan of cats. They‚Äôre honestly the sweetest cats and I love them to death, but cleaning up after 2 kittens is a hassle, and initially their litter box was kept in my bathroom upstairs. However, I quickly got irritated at being the only one to have to clean out their litter box (they shit SO MUCH), so I took the time to go to Target and get my roommate a litter box and litter to keep in her bathroom too. I set it all up for her, she paid me back on venmo, and I thought that was that. 

Within days, the litter box was moved out of her bathroom and into our hallway, right next to the washer and dryer where we do laundry. She claimed it was because the cats would be able to use it even when she had her bedroom door shut, which makes sense, but the problem was that she never. cleaned. it. out. I also think she just didn‚Äôt want to deal with the smell in her bathroom. It would just sit there and get disgusting, and like I said, my other two roommates were super clean people and obviously bothered by this. Eventually one of the other girls moved it to our back door because she was sick of looking at it. I would wait and see how long my roommate would wait before she would finally clean it, and she just never would unless I was with her to help her. Every time we would pass by it walking out the backdoor she would comment something like ‚ÄúUgh, their litter box is getting gross. We have to clean it soon‚Äù And in my head I was like ‚Äúwe???‚Äù I got the litter box for YOU, I already clean up plenty of shit in my own bathroom, put on your big girl pants and handle this one yourself. 

So eventually I just threw the litter box out, since it never got cleaned and I sure as hell wasn‚Äôt cleaning out 2 of them. It took her a couple days to even notice it was gone. When she asked about it I told her I threw it out because it never got cleaned, and she seemed fine with that because she never got a new one. My boyfriend and I are the ones who get absolutely everything for them, food, treats, litter, etc. We‚Äôre fine with this because like I said, I love these cats to death and I‚Äôve basically taken entire care of them since we got them. Initially when we first got them my roommate just told her to venmo request her whenever I got them food or litter, which I did the first couple of times, but after awhile it was clear that I would be the only one actually going out and taking the time to buy their supplies, and at that point the cats were basically my own, so I‚Äôve paid for all of their stuff myself since the beginning of this year and she‚Äôs never noticed or offered to chip in. 

So basically, I consider the cats mine at this point, which is why it doesn‚Äôt bother me that I pay for all their stuff. My roommate will still post videos and pictures of the cats on her social media, to show off her cute ‚Äúpets‚Äù, but she doesn‚Äôt do anything to actually care for them besides letting them lay in her bed with her sometimes when they‚Äôre out of my room. 

However, I‚Äôve decided to live on my own when my apartment lease ends in a few months, (if you can‚Äôt tell, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of this roommate) and I obviously plan on bringing the cats with me. I raised them, feed them, play with them, take care of them, etc. During the few periods of time where I won‚Äôt be at the apartment for a few days, I always feel bad leaving the cats because I genuinely don‚Äôt trust that my roommate will remember to care for them. There was one week where I was out of town in Arizona, and when I came back, the litter box was filthy, and she left a plastic bag of litter and shit in my BATHTUB that she didn‚Äôt even bother to throw out, as if that was her attempt at cleaning out the litter. So yeah, I don‚Äôt trust her ability to care for them on her own. 

But the roommate still considers us to have ‚Äújoint custody‚Äù of these cats. I haven‚Äôt told her I‚Äôm moving out yet (that will be a fun issue to deal with in itself) and she‚Äôs going to be even more pissed that I‚Äôm planning on bringing the cats with me. Besides paying for half when we initially got them, she hasn‚Äôt really contributed financially for anything, and even though it was her that initially wanted them, it‚Äôs me that actually takes care of them. The cats are sisters and very close, so splitting them up isn‚Äôt an option in my eyes. I feel like she‚Äôs had multiple opportunities to show that she‚Äôs capable of taking care of them too and she‚Äôs failed on all of them. She refers to the cats as her ‚Äúkids‚Äù and is very attached to them despite doing nothing for them, and honestly complains about them all the time. Every day she‚Äôll be like ‚Äúugh the cats kept crying outside my door all morning‚Äù or ‚ÄúI could hear the cats running around all over the place last night‚Äù and I‚Äôm like, yes, they‚Äôre still young cats, this is what I deal with every single day. 

I‚Äôm planning on staying home this weekend nearby and asking her to take care of them while I‚Äôm gone. I know I‚Äôll come back to a filthy litter box and they probably won‚Äôt have water, so when I explain to her why I‚Äôm bringing them with me, I can use this weekend to further validate my point. I already know exactly how it‚Äôs going to play out (the same as it has every other time I‚Äôm gone). Edit: my boyfriend will still be there so he will definitely step in to care for them if needed! So within the next week or so I‚Äôm planning on dropping the bomb. She‚Äôs going to be very upset, I hate confrontation, and I want to break the news as easily as possible while also pointing out that she‚Äôs done very little in terms of caring for the cats.

We were extremely compatible and I really love her.

Has anyone had experience with someone who does this and has a fear of intimacy, and do they ever work through their emotions and realize they do feel something for you? I believe she does love me but because those emotions scared her she kept pushing them down. And the stronger they were the more she numbed herself.

In his house, his parents fight alot. We don't like being there so he comes here to hang out. Oh and we've been dating since school ended but liked eachother for a few months before.

He thinks my mom is weird and flirts with him. I've seen this, sometimes I think she makes a weird comment to him like, asking what he thinks of a new bikini. When we're outside in the pool she comments on my body (side note I've asked her to stop doing this, it's really embarassing to me my boobs are really small and she points it out) comparing me to her saying I won't look like a real woman unless I get a boobjob (but she got one too. her tits are only huge bc they're fake!) She offered to take her top off and my boyfriend just kindof laughed awkwardly. I guess she could have been joking, idk

Also she drinks a lot and has offered us alcohol before. My boyfriend admitted he's drunk a few times but feels weird getting alcohol from an adult. 

She gets touchy with him. He doesn't like that either but doesn't know what to say so he tries to laugh it off, I've seen this. Mostly in the pool and once when I came back from the kitchen while watching tv.

The weird thing is she constantly bugs me about being too PDA and wants to make sure I'm not having sex (we're not)

I don't know where else to hang out with my boyfriend during the summer. There's not alot around and it's really hot. What do I do? I told her once it made me feel bad how she acted to him, but she had no idea what I was talking about. Now I feel like we're being crazy.

Also I don‚Äôt only work a week. I still work like every day of the month. From morning to night. So even if my life wasn‚Äôt basic, I have no time for it. I plan on hard work til 40 and seriously retire at 40. With how I currently live and currently work I think it‚Äôs possible. That‚Äôs me. 

Now that‚Äôs just me, and I know i wouldn‚Äôt want me family to live how I live, j would give them the best if not what I can do the best to give them. When I have a family. I would be strict on my self but not my future love ones. I do what a family. 

This part is what I think the female side is going for, in all regular mood and tone talk. 
She is a recent political science graduate. She wants to get into law school, got a 172 on the lsat and has a high chance in doing so. Her life been consider pretty luxurious, saves small amount of money and buys a 5k film camera which I forgot what‚Äôs it called, her dad paid the rest. from what I heard he paid 4K. Being a ‚Äúcountry man‚Äù I only know the common brands like channel and lv bags that she has. I cant see what other stuff she has and the value but can see she has standards for everything. Doesnt like to do anything that would make her a maid per-say but can do it because she doesn‚Äôt want the house to be dirty or just not straight. Felt like it‚Äôs a common sense issue about certain things, like she dropped a banana on the floor once, it was half peel and I understand if you dump the peeled part away but the other half is still covered.  She dumped the whole thing. I don‚Äôt have other examples but many daily life things she does it differently and it cringes a poor guy like me. 

She doesn‚Äôt and won‚Äôt get marry anytime soon, maybe around the 3rd year or law school she would consider engagement and marriage on the law year. I am a family man and wants to build a family. 

So I met a girl in March, everything about her, and me. Us together felt very right. Like we  are a perfect match for each other. 

I am Chinese male 27. She is Chinese female 22. 

I deem spending money on my girlfriend as a regular and normal thing. Either it‚Äôs food, vacation, clothes, shoes, entertainment, electronics, etc is okay. That‚Äôs me spending money on her. Which I‚Äôm okay with. But during occasional times she would say words like, can you lend me some money? I‚Äôll pay you back. Started small like $100 for dry cleaning for interview clothes, $300 for contacts for interest preparedness, $1000 to buy yeezy shoes online for resale cause I know they will sell (which didn‚Äôt), $700 for something unknown, never mentioned, $2500 because she has no more money in her bank account. $500 more just to be safe. This was over a span of 4-6 weeks. There is more but under 100 I‚Äôll just skip. 
I remember these because I didn‚Äôt intend on spending these money, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm anything close to being cheap. Many would disagree with me. But many will agree. 

I‚Äôm from Michigan and she‚Äôs from New York. I think in her mindset deep down she just looks down on people who doesn‚Äôt know fashion or luxury living the life etc. before meeting her idol what yeezy were or supreme, never heard of it. 
I drive a Honda CR-V and she thinks it‚Äôs ugly. 
So recently I got hit in a auto accident. Insurance claims me not at fault. I was hit. The car was totaled. I‚Äôm fine. No injury thanks for asking. Getting a new car. Planning on getting Acura RDX. She hates it and gives me many insult comments like it‚Äôs a bad car. And that it‚Äôs cheap. 
So I went for a Lexus. 2020 RX 450h F Sport. Thought she‚Äôll be happier finally when the night before she says things like. You‚Äôre gonna pay that much for a ‚ÄúLexus‚Äù in a very insulting and negative way. More like not intentionally meant towards me I think. But very insulting. Wanted me to get a Mercedes. 
After careful consideration. And other friends advice. I plan on not listening to what she thinks on the car. I‚Äôm gonna get the Acura which is 22k cheaper. 

So I‚Äôm not exactly happy in this relationship, but at the same time I am. I just feel like she‚Äôs trying to change me into a New Yorker. Change me into someone more fashionable and be more of a appearance person when I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm not super old school I don‚Äôt think but to her she is. I feel suffocating at times. 

Reasons why I can‚Äôt or feel like I shouldn‚Äôt break up. She, at times deeply loves me and let‚Äôs me do whatever crazy sexual things I want. 
She does care for me when I meet her ‚Äústandards‚Äù. 

This part is very big. This is what makes my decision so hard. Is it too brutal or mean or whatever the word is? 
She recently had a miscarriage with my baby. 

I don‚Äôt want to change so much, I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt be with someone that can‚Äôt like me for who I am and respect that I work hard in making my money and spend them accordingly so it isn‚Äôt spent on random and useless stuff. 

During the recent car crash, she made me get 2 rental cars back to back just so she can have her planned July 4th bbq. Which cost me around $800. Then food and equipment and everything about $1500 more. Went from 1-2 week of planning dropped to 1 day due to car crash  and hospital visits. 

I should break up right? Been talking to a few people online, in real life and skipping out the in betweens I got more, break ups.",2019-07-08 15:14:38,0,1,relationship_advice
209,camasb,avocadosrcool,"Why do I constantly try to piss people around me off because I'm mad, then feel bad once they are mad?","Title. Sometimes I just find that I wanna piss people off so they can feel what I'm feeling, which is mad, but then they'll actually get pissed and I realise that I regret it. Then both of us are mad and no one is happy.

An example: My mom made me go out with her to some place, I didn't want to (sounds dumb after writing it down but whatever) She was nice at first but after I kept silent, she asked if I was mad. I said yes, and she immediately got pissed. I realised that I felt bad afterwards, and she took me home. Added some guilt tripping too, which was understandable I guess.

This is one of many examples. It happens with friends and boyfriend too, although I'm much more restraint with my friends.

I'm 16 by the way. I wanna know if anyone else does this? Or is this just really childish? Thanks.",2019-07-08 15:14:28,11,2,relationship_advice
210,camair,SaysSaysSaysSays,Hanging out with my [20M] best friend [19M] stresses me out,"So I‚Äôve been friends with this guy since middle school, and became really close a few years ago when we started working together. We‚Äôve been somewhat inseparable, we‚Äôve joked about having true guy love (think JD and Turk), our mutual friends joke that we‚Äôre dating and stuff, etc. He‚Äôs truly my best friend, he‚Äôs helped me through a lot (mostly girl stuff haha) and I‚Äôve shared more with him than anyone. 

Recently though, I‚Äôve become distant. So, he‚Äôs a really cool guy to be around when we‚Äôre having fun and stuff, but he has anger issues. Had them back in middle school, lost them in high school, but now they‚Äôre back. He‚Äôll just snap at something random, or get mad if something little doesn‚Äôt go his way. It was fine for a while I would just handle it but it‚Äôs to the point where I feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells. The recent thing is he‚Äôs been trying to get me over to his place to try D&amp;D with a few other friends. I‚Äôm not very excited about it, to be honest, magic and medieval style stuff has never been my thing, but I‚Äôve said I would try it and I plan on keeping my word. That being said, I‚Äôm going over there today and I‚Äôm really not in the mood to play D&amp;D, I‚Äôve had a long few days at work and just want to chill. But I‚Äôm scared that he‚Äôs gonna get pissed. Like yesterday he visited me at work and mentioned D&amp;D and when I seemed cold about it he snapped. 

Him being like this has led to a few of my close friends from high school to almost completely cut him out. The only time they see him are large group things. It always leaves me in an awkward position as well, I feel like I‚Äôm defending him to friends when he is brought up. I know I should talk to him but I‚Äôm really scared about him snapping and getting really angry. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd ever try and hurt me but he‚Äôs a way bigger dude than me and I could definitely not take him if shit came down to it. Idk. Has anyone else dealt with a friend like this?

TL;DR - best friend has anger issues that make me feel like I have to walk on eggshells.",2019-07-08 15:13:48,0,2,relationship_advice

212,cam9kz,Awright78,I think my SO is either cheating or addicted to porn,"So I‚Äôve been with my SO for just short of a year now, we‚Äôre both in our early 20‚Äôs and it‚Äôs a heterosexual relationship. When we first got together things were amazing, we were both so excited to be with each other, barely argued or disagreed and the sex was SO DAMN GOOD. 

As time‚Äôs gone on, particularly the past two or three months, we‚Äôve been arguing so often, we both get very easily irritated by each other and the sex is incredibly hit and miss. As someone with a very high sex drive this is particularly frustrating. 

We spend a lot of time together, often several days in a row with a one or two day break every now and then. The problem? Well pretty much every day he goes to the toilet about 3/4 times a day and will spend up to 20 minutes at a time in there, always taking his phone with him. He says that he‚Äôs trying to poo that whole time but a lot of the time ‚Äúnothing comes out‚Äù so there‚Äôs no smell, no evidence. Personally I‚Äôve never come across anyone who would wait 20 minutes on the toilet for something to come out on such a regular basis. 

He very rarely leaves his phone unattended but that doesn‚Äôt really matter anyway seeming as I‚Äôm not allowed to know the password to his phone even this far into a relationship, but I do want to respect his privacy. 

I‚Äôve always known him to have a high a high sex drive so it‚Äôs very confusing to have reached a point where we go days of being together with no action and more recently we‚Äôll go to have sex and he‚Äôll lose his erection pretty easily. I can‚Äôt turn him on like I used to, I‚Äôll even lie next to him playing with myself, which he used to react really well to, but now it seems to do absolutely nothing for him which is heartbreaking and humiliating for me. I‚Äôm now constantly questioning what‚Äôs wrong with me and what‚Äôs changed. 

When we‚Äôre not together I know that he‚Äôll masturbate up to 3 times a day on occasion. He‚Äôs also started to lie about masturbating if I leave the house for short periods of time saying he hasn‚Äôt done it when he very obviously has (the evidence is in the bin). Of course I understand that people still pleasure themselves when they‚Äôre in relationships and I don‚Äôt have an issue with that normally, but our sex life is suffering a lot and I‚Äôm trying to understand why. 

So my conclusions so far are that either he‚Äôs talking to someone else and maybe sending/receiving stuff with them or maybe he only gets off on porn now? 

Any ideas?",2019-07-08 15:11:43,6,2,relationship_advice
213,cam8qx,mahatmaandhii,Is it okay to just refuse to have the hard conversations in a relationship?,"So the relationship I currently have is kinda halfway between casual and a proper relationship. She doesn‚Äôt really seem to know what she wants. 

Every time I try to have a discussion with her and talk about what‚Äôs going on with us, or tell her I‚Äôm  confused and don‚Äôt feel like she‚Äôs really respecting me, she gets kinda irritated and tells me ‚Äòthis is the exact kind of conversation I‚Äôm trying to avoid‚Äô. I know she‚Äôs had some dodgy relationships in the past and I feel for her, but I‚Äôm not really like that and I think she‚Äôs just assumed what I am already. 

Thing is, I feel like even if this is just casual, those conversations still need to be had sometimes and both parties need to be happy. Especially when our relationship is pretty intimate and sexual in nature and she tells me about a lot of her issues. . We text each other pretty much every day. 

I dunno, am I doing something wrong by trying to discuss things with her? She seemed fine to discuss it the first time, but now it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt even talk to her about it. She‚Äôll just get mad. She even said ‚Äòyou talking about this makes me angry‚Äô. Feels a little one sided to me.

217,cam589,leftoversget,"RE: (20M) Complicated situation with ""girlfriend"" (20F)","hey lads. this is going to be a long one. i'm basically letting everything out. the past few weeks/ months have been very unsettling

met this girl in my uni a few months back. instantly hit it off. started liking her after a week or two. fast forward to end of May, she starts reciprocating and flirting back and i'm on cloud nine. she asked me out, she clearly put in more effort than i did. we hook up twice and yeah cute shit happens, both of us are happy.

but no, fuck all of that. she doesn't stay in the same city as i do and is back home (same country) for the summer. before she left she told me that we can't be together because she's going to be back home with her ex (now ""best friend"") who is like family and their parents are like best friends and her ex basically stays at her place and her parents are okay with that and whatnot. i give her the benefit of doubt and trust her when she says they won't hook up or anything but at the end of her long ass monologue she told me that she still can't get over him...... that was a shocker. they broke up in 2017 and honestly i don't know what i'm doing with my life right bow but please bear with me :)

yeah so she said she needs time to figure things out (2 months of vacation) and i said it'd be better for the both of us if we cut all contact and don't talk with each other at all because a. emotional overload and b. both of us will be busy (she has a job, i have a month long family vacation)

6 days after we blocked each other - she calls me and tells me she misses me and she wants me and proceeds to break down. by this time i had figured out how much she likes me and how much i mean to her and i cry too because it was too many emotions and it was genuinely sweet of her

we continue our correspondence - which had become a daily affair and 3 weeks back was when things started turning sour. 

she started telling me to keep things completely platonic and that we aren't a ""thing"" (well she needed time to figure shit out) and that every time i flirt she shuts me down. funny enough, she flirts a lot with me and i don't know what to say :') 

two weeks back, she had posted something on her facebook page. it was something she had worked on and i was really proud of it and i genuinely liked it so i shared it on my feed. she texts me and is mad about the fact that i shared it and that ""out of all the people who could have shared it, you're the only one who's going to get me shit because of it"" 

that shit really hurt. i deleted it and we haven't spoken ever since. i've consulted with exactly 4 of my friends and all have differing POVs. she's confused and she needs time and doesn't know what to feel, stop talking to her and you don't deserve her are what i've heard so far.

i'm genuinely confused and don't know what to do. she's stopped viewing my stories and social media altogether but i'm unblocked from her phone. i don't know how to proceed. part of me wants to wait till uni starts and make her feel like shit, part of me wants to talk to her right now even though it might show how much of a grasp she has over me. and the worst feeling of all is i feel that i'm the only one feeling like shit at the moment and she doesn't even care (i have no facts to back this up but i end up feeling like this all the time)

218,cam4tr,Concernedcousin00,I (23f) helped my cousin (16f) stand up to her mom and stepdad. Now they're angry with me and punishing her,"My little cousin Angela is like a little sister to me really. We both grew up as only children, and I babysat her for years. She's a great kid, smart and kind hearted. Kind of shy. She reminds me a lot of myself when I was younger. We've kept in touch, she wants to follow a similar career path to me. I'm a software engineer and she's really into programming, and robots. So we FaceTime every so often and catch up, I sometimes help her with her projects. And when I'm in town, I volunteer as a mentor with her high school robotics club.

Angela's parents divorced a few years ago, and her mom has primary custody. Her mom is with a new guy now, they're engaged and trying to blend the families. So, the guy is her stepdad now, and the guy's son is now her stepbrother.

It's been a tough time in her life recently, after her stepdad and stepbrother moved in. She doesn't have much of a relationship with her stepdad and in my opinion he hasn't done much work to foster one, so it's just awkward for her to have some guy she doesn't really know living there. And she doesn't get along with her stepbrother at all, according to her he's obnoxious and loud and annoying.

Last week, we were FaceTiming and she was pretty worked up about stuff at home. She was telling me how her stepbrother wouldn't stop trying to get on her nerves and get her to snap at him, like it was a game. Bothering her when she wants to study, or have time with her friends, or whatever. And she told her mom and stepdad and they told her that he was just trying to get a reaction, and to ignore him.

And that made her mad, she said she shouldn't have to put up with that stuff.

And I agreed. I told her that something I've seen way too much in life is that people will tell girls to put up with things they shouldn't have to, because it's easier for them than holding guys accountable for their bad behavior. I've seen it when I tried to report sexual harassment at an old job. How everyone dragged their feet on doing anything until I really brought out the big guns. And that it was something I've seen way too much of in school too.

I told her that it would serve her well in life to learn how to push these sorts of issues respectfully but effectively. And make people listen.She wanted advice on what to do, and I gave her a list of my thoughts...

1) Documenting everything, with time and dates. Those kinds of notes can really drive home just how often something happens. And it's harder to justify something as ""not a big deal"" when faced with those sorts of records.

2) Write out an email with that document attached, talk about the impact of the person's actions overall (like, I can't finish my homework, I feel stressed at home, etc) Also write what you would need to consider things resolved. Send it to her mom.

3) Know when to escalate and who to escalate to. (Like if things don't go well with your parents, talk to a school counselor or teacher.) Your documents and email from before can help with this.

4) throughout all this, be respectful but firm. Nothing is gained by losing your temper, that can only hurt you.

A day later, she called me up and said she had written an email to her mom and she wanted me to look it over before she sent it. And I did. It was really well written, she'd written down a list of events that upset her, she talked about how her schoolwork was impacted, about how it was a parent's job to teach their kids respect and boundaries at home. Because if that stuff isn't learned at home, where will it be learned? The whole thing was super mature and respectful, in my opinion.

I was really proud of her, I knew she was a good writer but I was still impressed by her email. And I encouraged her to send it to her mom and have a talk about things afterwards.

She called me that night saying her mom had read the email and seemed to take it well, they talked about what she'd said, and her mom told her that she hadn't realized how often that stuff was happening. And that she'd talk to her fiance about this.

But the next day, I got a furious call from the stepdad, he was accusing me of writing the email because Angela obviously couldn't write like that. And trying to interfere in a family, that I had no business interfering in. I tried to tell him that I'd only given Angela a bit of advice but her writing and her feelings were all her own. And he wasn't having it, screaming at me for being a liar. I hung up on him after a minute of that because I don't care to be screamed at. I ignored the next few calls from that number.

I also got a text from a number I didn't know, saying it was Angela and her parents had taken away her phone, and she was borrowing a friend's so she could tell me why she wouldn't be able to call for a while.

TBH I'm worried about her. Her stepfather seemed to have a hell of a temper, and it seems she's being punished for speaking up... What can / should I do?

tldr I tried to help my cousin stand up for herself. Her stepdad is mad, and I'm worried",2019-07-08 15:01:33,11,1,relationship_advice
219,cam4at,throwawayanon1505,I (27F) am trying daily for a week to get my BF (29m) to have sex...and it's 0-4,"We have been together for a bit over 8 months. We live together (it's recent). We have known each other for a very long time, many, many years. So moving in wasn't a concern of mine. We each have good jobs. We both work about the same hours, but he brings in almost double what I make.

Sex is our biggest issue. So I decided that for a week I would try to initiate sex or ask if we could. We are over a month now of no sex. These past 5 days, I have been doing almost all of the cleaning around the house. I binged the new season of ST with him, something he loves, cuddled, made every dinner, etc. I have gone out of my way to make sure he wasn't stressed with work. He had a long weekend with the holiday. And every evening, I took care of the bedtime routine with the kids. Let him play his video games (didn't ask him to play mine with me or my friends) and made sure we picked up his favorite drinks and some new snacks for him to try.

Day 1 - denied because he was sick (totally not mad)

Day 2 - made sure he was feeling ok (he was, I offered to make him soup and get him meds the day before and this day too, both denied) I tried not 5 minutes after we laid down, but he claimed he was asleep...maybe he was super tired?

Day 3 - Denied me because he didn't shower. I said ok, asked if he wanted to go shower and he said no, he was tired.

Day 4 - Denied because he has really bad chaffing from not showering the day before.

&amp;#x200B;

It's really hard not to feel annoyed. It's been over a month since we had sex. I know sex isn't the most important thing, but it is important. I wouldn't mind if this is just a once in a blue moon thing, but he won't see a therapist or doctor. He claims it is no longer a libido issue, but a timing issue? (he won't elaborate on this) I can count how many times we have had sex in 8 months. This hurts because he has talked about going to sex clubs, willing to do 3/4-somes, we have toys that are still packaged! (Edit - he has gone to sex clubs, before our relationship. He has told me that he has no problem if I want to go try it and he'd be happy to go.)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to break up. I'm happy in all other aspects of our relationship. I don't want to open the relationship or bring it up because while we are kinky, I don't want to risk any possible pregnancy so it's not an option until a doctor is willing to tie my tubes. Should I just keep trying? Am I expecting too much from him? Is this normal? Halp?",2019-07-08 15:00:21,12,1,relationship_advice

221,cam42u,Mae_Lemon,What role do I even play?,"Okay this might get lengthy. This is my absolute very first reddit post, so why not start here, seeing as my estranged relationships are what have led me to linger online so much these days.

My boyfriend (29m) and I (26f) are almost at the 5 year mark in our relationship. The longest one ive been in thus far. My previous relationship was with a guy for 3.5 years and had a whole slew of toxic mental patterns. So I sought my way out despite the other guy wanting me to stick around and keep trying, I honestly didn't feel I was suppose to be with that person for the rest of my life. You know when you just know, you know. Well I knew, and I left him and moved in with my sister. Shortly after that I met my current boyfriend on a dating app. Ok cupid or something. I can't remember the exact one. I felt like I was jumping from one relationship to the next way too quickly but that didn't really stop me. During this time my mother was nearing the end of her cancer battle of 9 years, so having someone to help me through that time right after a terrible break up is to this day why I feel I'm still here and why I kept going. I knew this. I knew I didn't want to be alone. So I found my current boyfriend, lets call him Jared. When I first stumbled upon jareds profile I was astounded by how interested I was in a person I hadn't even spoken to before. There was something about him. Obviously handsome in his pictures, but more than that, something in his eyes I recognized and it drew me in. So I gave him the initial message. I said to him that I wasn't sure who he was but that I knew I wanted to meet him. I almost insisted that I just HAD to meet him. We talked for about 2 weeks on the app before meeting in person. He lived in a city only 40 mins away from me. 
      I guess this is where our actual relationship started. We slept together the very first time we met after talking only 2 weeks which is soooo out of the ordinary for me. As I had only had sex with my previous boyfriend and thats it.  He was overly kind and sweet to me compared to most men in my life. He made me feel like he had to have me. Realizing years down the road that was a big mistake not seriously getting to know each other first. I thought he was a dream come true. I showered him with love and affection the first year we were together I really set the stage of me wanting to care for him unconditionally. He was more romantic then I would assume most men to be at the start of a relationship, but he was still the more reserved one between the two of us when it came to falling in love. It happened fast for me. Id never experienced such a gentle male ucounterpart and I wanted that in my life so much. I needed it. My life has been a lot of chaos but he reminded me of what was actually important and to breath and take a step back. He helped me get out of a lot of bad habits like smoking and doing an array of drugs. I feel like I owe a lot to him for being healthy and much more self aware then I was before I met him. I was nearing a dark downward spiral that I'm not sure I wouldnt have fell down had it not been for him showing me so much light in my hours of darkness. Despite all of that there was one thing about him that bothered me from the start. I felt as if I had to win this guy over. As he talked about his ex girlfriends a lot and also wore a necklace with a key on it that his ex gave him. So right from the start I felt I had to earn this guys love. Not a good recipe for someone who doesnt quite love themselves yet.

       Another important thing for me to mention is that when I first met jared (as I would do with anyone im around) I chameleon morphed into the person that I think he would accept the most. I unintentionally threw away my personality to adopt his own in an effort to be accepted by him. I have a personality disorder of which I wasn't aware of at the time. I wasn't quite being fake, I was just putting my best foot forward so to speak but in a way that I think I masked the reality of who I can be. Which turns out to be a monster. I have monstrous reactions to jareds lack of understanding of my feelings. Another important point to mention is afrer a year into this relationship with jared I moved to his city to be with him (as I was the only one willing to drive back and forth to see him and was tired of wasting the gas) and left my family in the town 40 mins away. Which is fine. I'm happy I moved because I've had decent opportunities since and I'm happier at this job anyways. We moved in together when I moved out that way. 2 months after moving in together he lost his job. I told him then I didn't mind to put in the work to help keep us both afloat so he could really consider what it is he wants in life before going and getting another restaurant job that I know he despised. I can't say that he didn't get the chance of at least a lot of self reflection during that time (he didn't have a job for 3 years after losing his). I didn't mean for him to take that much time. He spent a lot of it just playing video games. Obviously that wore down the relationship, after we had lived together a whole year, this means we've been dating for 2 years now, and things started falling apart and have felt broken ever since. 

        It started with my resentment towards him not helping me with all of OUR bills. I wanted the oppurtunity at some self reflection. I needed to not be working soo much so I could peice together what I actaully want, it's always been hard for me to discern what it is that I truly want vs what others want for me. Also at this point my mom had passed away and I was at a ripe young age of 23. I was a complete disaster after that. So I begged and begged for jared to get a job again so I could take a step back and reflect. He didnt make the effort on his own after my insesent nagging. So I got him a job (at a restaurant) that I work at. He accepted it and has worked at the same place I work since November. So through the entirety of our relationship hes worked an accumulated max of 1 year total. In 5 years we've been together. The job I got him he only wants to work 3 days. I work 2 jobs now, 5 days a week 2 of those days I work like 13 hour shifts with little to no break. I know if it wasn't for my nagging he wouldn't have a job. It hurts my heart that he doesn't want to help provide for me and our family. He hasn't asked for extra shifts or made an effort to move up. The only things he pays for are his phone bill and half the money for the weed we both smoke. So I'm still providing every other basic need for this man. And it has produced so much resentment towards him. I get really enraged about this and let it boil in my head. He also has a massive issue with the way I decide to express my emotions. Mostly and unfortunately through anger and sadness, 2 emotions that make him super uncomfortable. I don't want to misconstrue anyone, I react horribly, I know I have a right to express my feelings but when it negatively impacts another person, I'm officially crossing a boundry and I do believe its not okay for myself to express the way I have been. But I'm just not sure how else to do so. And I need need need to be in weekly therapy. But guess who doesnt have time or the money because they're spending their entire life providing for someone they love? 

      I mentioned that we had sex very early on in our relationship, and I wanted to touch on that again. I know sex is important in a relationship. I've seen it first-hand be the reason of disconnection for Jared. And for myself really. I believe Im somewhere on the asexual spectrum but I cant be certain if thats my cop out for having negative feelings towards the person wanting the sex. My first 3.5 year relationship I wasnt sexually attracted to him at all for hygiene reasons. This one with Jared I am when I really concentrate on it. I find him very attractive but I don't yearn for sex the way he does. Or most people do I guess. I do have some negative feelings about sex due to past traumas and with this relationship i think my sex trauma is getting worse because theres soo much ill feelings towards myself for not wanting it when my partner wants it. And not being able to push myself to do it when I really don't want to. But at the same time I find it gross that it's expected of me at the very least on a weekly bases. Thats why I wish I would have waited longer for the sex in this relationship because I feel like since day 1 jared feels it owed to him simply because he's in a relationship. I dont think it's suppose to work that way but I guess I could be wrong. Holy shit this post is wayy to long. Im so sorry for whoever actually tolerated this and read through it, it was probably more excruciating that writing it. 

I guess what I'm looking for is an outside persepective to tell me how this all reads out? Im still confused what role I play in my toxic relationship. Sometimes I feel like im the one being straight up gaslight and other times I feel like im a crazy covert narcissist that doesn't actaully care about him, but just cares about how he can benefit me? I feel like I have empathy for others, but sometimes I feel like I may just be comparing others painful emotions to my own. Idk. Its so confusing? How can someone be empathetic and also a narcissist? It seems contradictory. Are they all just labels anyways and maybe us humans are not that black and white? Someone help me? Give me some insight please. For the record, I know I'm in a toxic relationship with a weird dynamic, but the reason for my sort of explaining my first long relationahip, is because I feel like some of the issues from my first releationship are carrying over, and if I don't end the cycle is it ever gonna stop? I love Jared. I don't want to live with out him. But how am I suppose to know whats worth fighting for and whats damaged beyond repair. If we break it off are we not just gonna see these patterns in our next relationships?

Okay really I'm done this time. Thanks.

I was into her a lot at the beginning, but as time went on she started making references about how good of a friend I was. I understood and didnt really make any moves and just stayed as friends. At the end of the year she wrote in my yearbook that she loves me like a brother. All this I was totally fine with, obviously she doesn't want to be with me.   
Then as we were texting last night, she asks me if I ever had a crush on her to which I replied yes. Then she comes out and says that she had feelings for me and she still does.

228,calxs6,justathrowaway55334,I [30F] am very lost in my relationship with [33M].,"So I don't really know where to start, but to say I feel frozen. I've been in a relationship with my husband for 10 years, married for 2, no children. A little background information: I have a history of mental problems- I was severely abused and neglected as a child, and just found out I'm autistic at the ripe age of 30. So I am very confused, don't feel like I can trust my feelings, and am looking for advice. I hope this is coherently written enough.

  
Anyway, I guess things started to go down hill at home when I decided to move with my husband to another state to help his father who had just had a heart transplant and was supposedly not doing well. His dad made himself seem sweet as could be. My husband and I had already been together for easily 6 or 7 years- I didn't hesitate to drop everything to go there with him to help the FIL.

  
When we moved, I feel like everything changed. My husband started behaving differently. FIL turned out to be a psychopath. Day 1 we get there and he literally screamed at me in front of my husband for dropping a piece of ice on the floor. Things never got better. His FIL picked on me, yelled at me, told my husband I didn't cook or clean enough or make enough money (I worked FT and made nearly as much as my husband, compared to my FIL who made 0$ and was quite capable of working after the transplant. He, in fact, put a new wall up in our bedroom while we were gone to split our room in half in order to accommodate another person without asking us. He also told the person that he randomly moved into half of our room they didn't need to pay any rent. We paid for everyones rent and food, no questions asked.) 

My husband guilted me for 2 years into staying there. Telling me ""Where will he go? I can't do that to him"" meanwhile the guy shit all over my husband, too. He had another son he liked more because he wasn't deformed (husband had a birth defect). To top it off, the FIL was incredibly racist and made demeaning remarks about all groups of people all day (including directed at me, as I am mixed). My husband became aggressive and angry toward me any time I would ask to leave. My husband would claim that he ""defended me"" or ""talked to him"" about it, but never did so in front of me and I never saw a difference.

But I'm not free of judgment. I engaged in an emotional affair at this point due to a feeling of a lack of support, inadequate coping mechanisms and a dose of cowardice. My husband apparently had been spying on my phone all along even before there was a reason to and quickly found the evidence of this. He acted in a very scary way, including punching the bed next to my head in the middle of the night, and waking me up at random hours by standing over me. I woke up because I could feel him staring at me. Driving very aggressively in the car with me. I had an accident with a semi-truck (husband was driving my car with me in passenger seat) and we were nearly crushed to death. I scream every time I get near a semi-truck and it's been years. So I feel like this behavior is intimidation.

We finally moved into our own place, and things haven't gotten better.

I don't feel that I can talk to my parents as they actually love my husband. Tell me he is the best thing that's ever happened to me. Every boyfriend I've ever had ... I feel like my family actually likes them better than me. My mom would always defend my boyfriends when we got in a fight. Like her own daughter didn't matter. Even though my mom regrets her abuse toward me, she also grew up abused and has no compass for what is right.

I feel so much shame, because I feel like I have no support. My husband has also maxed out my credit cards that he couldn't get opened in his name. I'm the one with the car- he has never owned his own. He has beat it to shit in accidents, doesn't take care of it. I feel like the love is gone, but that I can't leave even if I wanted to. During the emotional affair, the stress became so great (plus medication I was recently put on at the time by the psych and promptly discontinued) that I had a psychotic episode and quit my job. When we fight he brings up how much he has done for me, what he has done for me, how he stopped talking to his father ""for me"". He grabs at me at all hours, clings to me, kisses and touches me even when I don't really want to be bothered. He asks for constant validation, and is also constantly spying on my phone. He looks up numbers of people who text me and pays to get their information. Then confronts me and asks who they are. Any new person I meet gets added on facebook by him. I have no friends left that he hasn't infiltrated and made himself friendly with.

He also recently pushed me to try to sell my plasma for money. I asked him to see his bank account (he has all of my passwords and regularly looks at all of my information including bank), because I felt like something wasn't right. I know how much I had saved up and I know how much he makes.  He claimed to have no problem showing me, but refused to hand me the phone to look at the bank statements. He would point at things like ""see this is gas."" Well, finally, I said I needed to see it better and took the phone. There were 100's of micro-transactions from phone games which he claimed were fradulent, despite being over a 6 month period. I questioned how he could not notice 6 months of fradulent charges. I still haven't gotten a good answer. It's not that I think he should be the ""breadwinner"" or that I have any say about how he spends his money.... It's the lying that bothers me. I have caught him lying a few times, including years ago when he tried to also emotionally cheat on me. Trickletruthed me all the way. Trickletruthing me now I think. Went from ""I NEVER pay for microtransactional items"" to ""well a while ago I did"" to ""well these are fradulent"". I am actually exhausted from all the circles we go.

I think I just want away.. But I  guess the truth is, I am incredibly ashamed. I am scared he will turn all my friends and family against me and make this into something ugly. Also, I don't want to hurt him. I'm afraid I will end up in a shelter. I'm finally going to college and actually looking to graduate with a 4.0 despite my personal life.  Maybe to you guys this situation will seem very clear-cut, or maybe I deserve everything I get and I am too selfish to see it. Someone tell me, please",2019-07-08 14:45:39,11,1,relationship_advice
229,calxg4,thisisafarthrowaway,I [25M] am constantly having the same problems with my girlfriend [25F] and am unsure how to fix it.,"**Background**
So far the relationship has lasted 4 years, 2 of which we have been living together. For most of this time it was pretty much smooth sailing, meaning that we sometimes had 1 or 2 fights but then we would talk it out on the same day and it would be all good as new. During these 4 years my SO has grown termendously (not physically) and I couldn't be prouder of her progress. Meanwhile I have been much the same until a short while ago. Recently I have come to accept that I probably have some childhood trauma that resulted in some unhealthy habits in later life, the main one that is relevant here being that I adapt to what is needed of me and be that person in a given context - basically: I am a compulsive people-pleaser. I have talked about this with my SO and come to the realization that I have no idea what I want from life or who I even am because I have been living my life according to what other people want for the past 10-15 years. And from this point onward we have been having a number of problems.

**Problem A: mistrust and dishonesty**
Because I feel excessively responsbile for how other people feel, for the last 4 years I have been telling my SO exactly what she wanted to hear from me just so that she would be happy. Don't get me wrong, this was not all a huge lie that I decided to feed her one day in my evil lair; I really did think that I wanted all the things I said (even though I am not so sure now). I also was (I think) a fairly thoughtful boyfriend, I bought little thoughtful gifts, planned trips, cooked meals, organized dates, and thought of activities to do. By saying that this was all a *role* (for lack of a better word) I've basically voided all of that. She doesn't know what to believe and what not to believe ('did you do x because you wanted to or just so I would like you more/wouldn't get angry'). I obviously cannot (and do not) blame her. I think in time this trust could be rebuilt but the truth of it is, even though I have this knowledge of myself (and my peoplepleasing habits), I find it incredibly hard to act accordingly. I still overthink every single thing I say and am afraid to say the wrong words. Whenever we fight, I often completely freeze up and am unable to say anything at all, which makes things a whole lot worse because SO starts mistrusting me more and feels shut out and in consequence unloved. 

**Problem B: not listening**
This brings me to what probably is my biggest flaw: I am a bad listener. Whenever we fight, there is a conclusion and we agree on changing something so that we can do it better next time. During the fight (I think) I register this conclusion, but in practice if it doesn't come up for a week or 2 it just as easily evaporates. And this is terrible for multiple reasons, because a) SO thinks I don't care about her or our relationship because I do not remember these things that are obviously important, b) I feel terrible for not remembering them and hurting my SO making me even more terrified of doing the wrong thing, and c) it results in us having the same fight. Over and over. With the same conclusion. Only each time it is more painfully obvious how poorly I register any of it. I am at complete loss on this issue - I do not know how other people do it. So far I have tried repeating it over and over in my head after a fight and I have tried writing it down on paper but whenever it comes to a point to put this to practice there is no way I can reproduce any of it.

**Problem C: narcissism**
Whenever a fight drags out long enough, I get so upset that I just completely shut down. I start hating myself for what I did and rather than taking a step back and looking at the problem we are having in the relationship, I make it a problem that stems from me and I start 'punishing' myself for it. This usually results in my SO trying to calm me down and we reach some conclusion on what has happened here and how it can be done better next time. Sometimes we then are able to discuss the actual problem, but lately this is less and less the case and it usually results in her resenting me even more for making it about me. I used to be able to put aside my emotions in the past and to be what she needed from me and probably coud do so again, but at this point I feel like that is just another role I would be playing and that seems unfair to both her and me. 

We are now fighting roughly once a week and it is not resolved on the same day. She is a rock-star communicator, but I am not and lately I have been getting even worse at communicating than I ever was. I have no family or friends to talk to. This is my first and only relationship and I have no reference point for what a good relationship is (outside of TV, which I do not hold as a very reliable source). At this point in the relationship I do not know how I can make things better or even if I want to make them better, because if truth be told, we have very little common ground. What we share is where we see ourselves in the future and what we want to be doing and what our priorities are, but when it comes to hobbies, schedules, and many little things, we are just not at all in line. Furthermore, I have been growing less and less thoughtful, I still do 'nice things', but they have become such a regular part of our life that they are not special like they used to be and I do not take the time to think of something new. 

Furthermore, my SO cannot really handle me being so unwitting (I am not sure if this is the right word, but what I mean to say is that I know nothing and have no answers to any question she asks and it grinds her gears). This I find difficult, but I can see and understand her point. Even so, I just feel unsupported by the one person I want support from in this situation.  

I am on a waiting list to get into therapy because all of this is too much to handle by myself, but the waiting list is long and its going to be a while before I can get professional help. 

Internet-strangers, I want your advice because I have no idea what to do. I want to know if you think this is an unhealthy relationship. I want to know how you manage to remember important things in a relationship. I want to know how you are able to have a conflict without muffling away all your emotions. I want to know how you know that you are in a relationship in which you want to be. I want to know how you even know what it is you want to do in life. How do you talk to real people about this stuff? Where do you find them? 

I am not looking for clear-cut solutions, I am just looking for some opinions and eperiences so that I can at least start trying to figure some of these things out; I really don't know where to start. 

**tl;dr:**
I have concluded that I have unhealthy relationships with people and that I need to fix that. In wake of this realization my long-term relationship has been suffering and I have come to realize that I make some very grave mistakes in how I deal with my SO and I am unsure how to better myself. I am looking for examples and experiences from strangers because I have nobody else.",2019-07-08 14:44:51,5,3,relationship_advice
230,calx03,Improperuseofk,[27/f] struggling to connect sexually with my long term bf [26/m],"I've been with my boyfriend for almost 6 years now, we live together in a house we own with a large fur family that we share. Overall, we love the life we have together and enjoy doing lots of the same hobbies but we do not align sexually according to him, and I'm not entirely sure why. 

From his perspective I'm too boring for him, and when I try to do the things that he says would spice it up it comes off like I'm trying too hard and is laborious and awful. Similar commentary for even our most vanilla, day to day sex is that he just doesn't like it, that most of the way I interact with him is a turnoff. 

From my perspective, it's very hard to judge what he wants in the moment, sometimes I'm too slow sometimes I'm too fast with the leadup, but it never feels like he's fully present. He doesn't want to kiss me or hold me or look me in the face, so I constantly feel like I'm fighting for his attention or on the verge of pissing him off.  I wear lingerie, I try to touch him, I have buttplugs and vibrators but it feels so awkward and horrible to be doing those things alone while I can't get him to engage and play with me instead of just being bored beside me. He says he wants more communication and for me to take the lead, but when I suggest something like me giving him a blowjob he thinks it's ""pathetic"" or when I suggest something he can do he thinks I'm assigning him a task that he didn't sign up for. 

We've been dealing with this for a while where we can't seem to get in sync. I feel like sometimes we do have an intimate encounter that's fun and pleasurable but then he later tells me that I'm a ""constant disappointment"" so I guess what I think is good is not very good for him even at the times he seems to be enjoying it. The rest of our relationship he says he's very happy with so it would be a shame to throw away a good relationship for sex, but I feel so inadequate and he very much reinforces those thoughts when he's frustrated. Overall, I feel confused on how to be different sexually in a more fun and casual way that engages him, but he doesn't want to give me specifics as he says it's not the specifics that make it bad, it's the overall vibe. Which leaves me more confused. 

Can someone tell me how they've been successful in seduction and connecting with their partner who seems very disinterested? 



[[[[   Context where we're at now: 
Last night after trying to engage with him, he threw me off in frustration and just kept saying ""it's just not good"" eventually he ended up telling me that when he first met me he thought how happy he would be to date me, but after being together and knowing all of my shortcomings, if he could go back and tell himself not to date me he would. This is extremely hurtful for me, and I feel like if things are really that bad then it feels like he's just with me out of convenience of our intertwined our life has become. I don't want to coast forever, I would actually like someone who would one day want to marry me and feel happy and lucky to be with me despite my shortcomings.  ]]]]

Is it wishful thinking to hold out hope that we can be better to the point where he does feel happy to be with me or is a relationship where it's okay to say that too far gone?",2019-07-08 14:43:49,3,5,relationship_advice

232,calwoe,CocoaKhaleesi,My coworker (33F) and I (31F) have a worsening relationship and I'd like advice on a power move that will make her back off.,"TL;DR: unprofessional coworker with whom I have bad blood used an all staff picture where I look unprofessional (instead of the approved version of the same picture) and printed it on hundreds of flyers advertising for an event. How do I establish a ""stop fucking with me"" non-verbal message?

&amp;#x200B;

Coworker (marketing) got hired 3 months after me (data analyst and educator). We're a team of fewer than 10 people. At first, we shared my very small office (nonprofit life): her desk was a foot away from mine. Disrespectful and unprofessional behavior started then: saying hello to all staff members in the office and ignoring me, not saying hello back when I said it to her (I don't do that anymore), loud farting/burping, loud chewing while eating at her desk, loudly interjecting and talking to herself all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

That I could deal with because it's just very poor manners (plus, we recently relocated into different offices in a new building). What I can not deal with is her lack of professionalism. She constantly changes shared account login info without communicating. Once she told our boss (CC'd all staff) that the reason why she fucked up on her annual report was because I gave her the wrong data, which was false and I proved that by sending everyone the actual document I sent her with the correct data. She never apologised and acted as if nothing happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Lots of other small jabs here and there have established the fact that we now have bad blood. My supervisor cannot stand her either.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today. I got back to work from a week long vacation. Hundreds of flyers for our Open House event get delivered. I look at one flyer and it has an all staff photo where I look high and asleep while the rest of the team looks just fine. Please note that there's an all staff photo, approved by our CEO, where all staff members look professional. But the coworker went out of her way to use the one picture taken just a few seconds earlier while I was blinking. I know this was intentional. I sent her an email asking her to use the approved staff photo where we all look awake going forward and she goes ""sure. thanks."". Again, no apology.

&amp;#x200B;

I am fed up. I do not want to have a sit down with her or talk things out. We're a very small team and do not wish to go to HR with this as they won't do anything about it. How do establish a ""stop fucking with me"" non-verbal message?

233,calwo5,L2051,My (M31) GF (F31) can only come with vibrator.,"I don't really know what to do. I can't make her come during sex without a vibrator, and that is not a problem that I usually have, to the best of my knowledge of cause. I had to fight with the infamous death grip myself, is there something equivalent for women an vibrators? Once we incorporate the vibrator, she is able to climax. She has not been in a relationship for some time, and in that time she bought a vibrator, so it is a new situation for her as well. She said that in her previous relationship she was able to climax without problem. She said she came close sometimes in certain positions/with certain stimulation, but is unsure what would take her over the edge. As an aftereffect of death grip I usually last pretty long, so we either give up or use the vibrator, which is fine but still irks I feel it should be an option not a necessity. Could it be the vibrator, should I ask her to lay of it for some time (we see eachother on the WE due to distance and she uses the vibrator during the week)?",2019-07-08 14:43:08,42,3,relationship_advice
234,calw7x,fookinshit,"Brother and his girlfriend have ongoing problems, she confides in me behind my bros back, don't know what to do","Really, any advice is appreciated. I feel like this situation is a ticking time bomb.

You'll are gonna need some context. My bro and I had a pretty bad relationship when we were younger, my dad pretty much put a wedge between us. However, as we got older, we put it all behind us and are on much better terms now.  Our interactions are very limited and I think this is why we are on better terms. He met his girlfriend and me and her instantly got along. She's one of the nicest, kindest people I've ever meet.

Now to the dilemma. I didn't know they were having problems until she called me out of the blue crying and asking for advice. She also insisted that I keep it to myself. I know my brother and if he found out she spoke to me, he would be very very angry and that'd be the end of their relationship so I complied. After that first call, she started calling and texting pretty much every day for a few weeks. Each time, she seemed to be in extreme emotional distress; I didn't have the heart to tell that I was uncomfortable talking to her in secret.

As I learned more, it was VERY obvious that my brother is being an emotionally abusive asshole like he was to me when we were kids. He's said things that any other person would end a relationship over. He's very clearly in the wrong. If he were anyone else, I'd tell her to get away from that relationship asap but he's my brother, and I can't bring myself to say that. So, all the advice I've been giving has been pretty generic (which I feel terrible about doing because she doesn't deserve the shit he gives her).  At this point, she's spoken to me so much and told me so much that If my bro finds out, he'd probably cut ties with me too. Since a few months she's not been calling me about this  but I can tell whenever I visit that their not really all that solid.

I don't see their relationship working out and for her sake, I hope it doesn't. I just need advice on how to navigate this when he inevitably finds out about all this.

I know this was long, so thanks for reading. Please comment if anything is unclear and I'll edit. Thanks in advance!",2019-07-08 14:42:08,4,4,relationship_advice
235,calw7w,lewdanny,Should I (23 F) breakup with my boyfriend (24 M)?,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little under a year. We met last summer and have been in a long distance relationship ever since. Seemingly, things are pretty solid. Our families are supportive of our relationship, as are our friends. We‚Äôre very alike, but very different. We have lots of fun together and we‚Äôre constantly making each other laugh and smile. We are very much in love. Sitting on the same side of the booth at restaurants, always holding hands and giving each other kisses, and being that ‚Äúgross‚Äù couple in public whenever we get the chance.

However. When things are bad. They‚Äôre *bad*. We don‚Äôt fight frequently, but when we do we have no concept of how to talk to one another. We don‚Äôt yell. Or scream. Or call each other names or curse. It‚Äôs just the tact(?) isn‚Äôt there. It seems as though the two of us (because of our pasts) are too caught up in being taken advantage of, to be ‚Äúthere‚Äù for the other person when we get into stupid fights.

We are currently living together, (he got a new job and it‚Äôs in my town) and our lease ends in September. After another fight, my boyfriend decided we should break up. I suggested that we have an in-depth discussion about our problems, and try our best to remedy what we can until September. If things aren‚Äôt better then, we can go our separate ways.

There‚Äôs an added layer of complexity that my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt know about. I am insanely jealous. Not in a bad way. I was in an abusive relationship for several years where I was cheated on and lied to in every way you can imagine. I don‚Äôt stop my boyfriend from doing things. Or project my nonsense onto him or accuse him of things. But every time he mentions a girl I get this sinking feeling. Almost like I‚Äôm about to be violently ill. He‚Äôs recently started a new internship, and it seems like all the new hires for his team are girls. 

And just hearing about the girls in his life I get sick. I mean sick to my stomach. When he hangs out with them I can‚Äôt eat. I can‚Äôt relax. Sometimes I do actually get sick and throw up etc.

And I‚Äôm so happy for him and this job. But when I start graduate school we will be long distance again. And I hate feeling scared. And I don‚Äôt know how to stop it. I see girls in his apartment building and wonder if he‚Äôll just hook up with one of them when I‚Äôm gone. I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôll get close to a coworker and leave me. I know I‚Äôm insecure, but I don‚Äôt want to be. And I‚Äôm not sure how to fix it so I can be the best version of myself for him and for us.

And if I can‚Äôt, what do I do? We‚Äôre so perfect in a lot of ways. But so messed up in others. I don‚Äôt know if holding onto this is just us refusing to admit we‚Äôre not ready. Or if we can bounce back from all the stuff we‚Äôve been through.",2019-07-08 14:42:08,2,1,relationship_advice
236,calvmn,CapitalDinner,My wife (33F) and I (35M) totally misinterpreted a good friend (30F) and now I‚Äôm embarrassed and don‚Äôt know what to do. Any advice?,"I think I messed up.  Hopefully not badly, but I made a stupid and embarrassing mistake and could use some advice.

For the better part of a year, a female friend has been really friendly with my wife and myself.  Friendly to the point of where we felt like she was giving us a feeling of wanting to really be with us in a more intimate way.  My wife and I talked about this and were never really opposed to it.  We kind of left the door open and my wife would flirt back with her when she got that idea from her, never anything super serious or anything.

This has been going on for close to a year now and we decided we‚Äôd just try and be a little more confident about it.  We sent her a Snapchat picture of the two of us in a hot tub, still clothed and everything but a little more flirty than usual.

She sent me a message back and said this was making her uncomfortable.  Apparently she had been getting a vibe from us that we were into that, which she wasn‚Äôt into.  I get the feeling she‚Äôs been upset with me ever since because she hasn‚Äôt really replied back since we‚Äôve had that conversation.  She‚Äôs still looking at my Instagram and Snapchat stories so I haven‚Äôt had any indication she‚Äôs blocking or ignoring me or my wife.

I‚Äôm just super embarrassed.  My wife and I totally got the vibe that she was hitting on us in that way but we evidently totally misinterpreted it.  Or maybe she got cold feet once we actually replied with interest, I don‚Äôt know.  In any case, I hate this feeling that she‚Äôs upset because she‚Äôs a good friend.

Should I give it time?  I‚Äôve already told her I misinterpreted things and was embarrassed and apologized, but it still sucks that she‚Äôs giving us the could shoulder.  Anyone have any advice?",2019-07-08 14:40:51,23,8,relationship_advice
237,caluoq,yogiibee,"I (27F) need to build trust with my BF (27M) but don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs asking too much, or I‚Äôm being unreasonable.","Hi Reddit, 

I‚Äôm not even sure where to start right now. I feel like I‚Äôm going insane and could just use a different opinion.  

I (27F) have been with my boyfriend (27M) for 11 months now. We‚Äôve been friends for going on 4 years, in addition to that. 

When we first started dating, I was in the middle of a messy divorce. I got married young when my high school boyfriend joined the army, and we were married for 6 years before we split. The divorce process, at that point, had been going on for almost a year due to the military being the military and getting us wrong information time and time again regarding both the house we bought, and the GI bill privileges I used. 

Granted, my ex and I ended on good terms. We both agreed that we could easily be friends and only friends. We were both happy for each other when we started dating different people respectively. 

BF was visibly and vocally not happy about anything dealing with my divorce. Any time I vented about it, he‚Äôd get upset, so I wouldn‚Äôt vent about it. Any time I needed to meet with my ex to go over paperwork, he‚Äôd get upset about it. I even offered him to come with me multiple times but it was an issue every time that would spill into an argument that lasted all night. 

So I did something I wasn‚Äôt proud of and would just have my ex stop by the house to sign paperwork when BF wasn‚Äôt there. Or I‚Äôd text my ex a couple of questions regarding various loans we were in the process of getting squared away. Nothing nefarious at all. Both of us agreed that we were better off separate, and my ex was seeing someone as well. Once my ex stopped by the house to get the rest of his things out of the garage when I wasn‚Äôt home. 

BF found out about all of this and rightfully blew a gasket that I was lying and hiding that from him. We ended up taking some time, but ultimately deciding to give things another shot. He even messaged my ex asking if anything unsavory happened, and my ex said no. 

Since then, I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôm going crazy. Where I‚Äôm a naturally outgoing person who makes friends with anyone I meet, BF doesn‚Äôt like that. BF gets insecure if I‚Äôm at work and talking to a male coworker and I bring it up in casual conversation. 

Example being: I keep a Pokemon plushie on my desk and a couple co-workers (both married with children) asked if I played Pokemon Go. I said yes, and we added each other. They invited me to their weekly boardgame night, and I told BF but he wasn‚Äôt happy about it. He didn‚Äôt see why I needed to take it beyond ‚Äòprofessional‚Äô by talking about hobbies or potentially playing boardgames with their families. 

So I shut off friendships with  men at work. 

I play video games a lot and have had online friends for going on 10 years. But me playing with them made him uncomfortable, so I shut them out too. 

One time, when I was playing Overwatch, I was the healer on the team and a random teammate said ‚ÄòThanks for the great heals, Mercy! (the name of the character)‚Äô and I responded with a little ‚Äò‚ù§!‚Äô. And that launched into a whole argument too because that was considered to be flirting with other men online. When I pointed out that my name on the game was very gender neutral, he said there was still the possibility they knew I was a woman. 

And things just got worse from there. 

I can‚Äôt take my phone with me in the bathroom, or the shower. Because I could be texting someone he doesn‚Äôt approve of. When I get an incoming text, it‚Äôs the expectation that I tell him who it is, and what we‚Äôre texting about. 

Once, one of my old gaming friends messaged me about an auto-immune disease I have. He asked how it got diagnosed, and how it affects my day to day life. I explained a little bit, and he said he was worried because his sister was getting diagnosed with it. 

BF wanted me to drop the conversation because me ‚Äòcomforting another man‚Äô about anything was seen as completely inappropriate. 

I can‚Äôt run errands after work without asking permission. IE can‚Äôt run to the bank to pay my car loan on the way home. Can‚Äôt run to the pharmacy to pick up my prescription on the way home. Can‚Äôt stop by the grocery store. I need to spell out where I am and what I‚Äôm doing, otherwise he gets an anxiety spike and thinks I‚Äôm off doing something nefarious. 

I‚Äôve never cheated. On anyone. Ever. And wouldn‚Äôt ever. 

I cut communication with my ex after the divorce was finalized because it made MF uncomfortable to have the friendship there. 

But he‚Äôs tried to spin it around and say that all of these things that I‚Äôm upset about are my fault. Because I lied early on. So I need to be patient and atone for those mistakes. 

I asked if it would ever get to the point where we‚Äôre equal. He said ‚ÄúI believe it could, but it would be irresponsible for me to say it will for 100%‚Äù.

Here‚Äôs the biggest thing, though. 

Last night during an argument, I told him I was getting frustrated because I didn‚Äôt feel like an equal partner in the relationship because I had to ask permission to do menial, day-to-day things and there were a lot of double standards in the relationship. 

The argument escalated, and he called me verbally abusive. And that fucked me up HARD. I said I needed space. I started trying to evaluate everything I say and how I could be abusive. I looked it up and tried to apply it to myself in various ways and couldn‚Äôt make a connection. 

I went back downstairs and asked him how I was verbally abusive. He responded that I take things out on him. 

I asked how I take things out on him, and he said ‚Äòwell you get upset at ME and not the situation‚Äô. 

I tried to point out that ‚Äòthat‚Äôs not being abusive, that‚Äôs me being upset.‚Äô 

I pointed out that I NEVER call him names, I NEVER put him down, I NEVER criticize him and I NEVER say things that I know will hurt him.

When I did that, he said I was being ‚ÄúNitpicky‚Äù about his use of words. I tried to explain that if he was going to accuse me of being an abuser, I needed things to back that up so that I could IMPROVE. 

I feel like I‚Äôm going insane. I do love him. When we‚Äôre good we‚Äôre amazing. But then I try to look at my life and where I was  a year and a half ago, how I was spending every weekend out with friends or on the lake or joining in with co-workers for a coffee after or before work. And I can‚Äôt do that anymore. I worry that I‚Äôm changing/adhering to his wants too much and losing myself in the process. 

I understand that trust takes time to heal after I lied about meeting with / talking to my ex. And I understand there are certain ways that I need to bend to help build that trust and reassure him. But I don‚Äôt know how much is too much‚Ä¶

Writing all of this out, it sounds like I just need to leave but that‚Äôs easier said than done.

I guess my question is: are all these things he‚Äôs asking normal? When I‚Äôm in a relationship should I just shut off any male friends I‚Äôve had through the years? Should I just not make a fuss about not having my phone in the bathroom? Should I just suck it up and wait for the day things are okay on his end?",2019-07-08 14:38:46,10,1,relationship_advice

239,caltvi,yelloworange19,I (23m) struggling with how to proceed with female (21) friend.,"At the beginning of the year, we hired this girl at work, she never worked for me but I was involved in her training. We became pretty good friends at work but with both of us being fairly shy and not confidant in ourselves nothing every really came from it. She got let go a couple of months later and we went about a month with out talking with each other. Main reason being that I had not gotten her number as she was pretty weird about that kind of thing. I am work friends with the person that got her the job who is friends with her mom. We eventually got each others number and started talking again. This started as random texts but quickly turned into all day text conversations and almost daily phone calls from her to talk. She has a bit of a sketchy past relationship wise and is not very trusting and has a lot of insecurities about herself. 

I have heard from out mutual friend that she has mentioned not really knowing sometimes what to talk about when we talk on the phone. I have told her that we don't need to talk daily but she says its comforting to talk with me and that hearing my voice helps her calm down when she is anxious over family stuff. recently she has started to grill me about my past relationships, wanting to know if I am still in touch with them or if I still have feelings for any of them. I have told her no to both questions and it seems like she is trying to feel things out. 

Anyway, my roommates and I had one to many drinks last night and she called to vent about an argument that she had had with a friend about her not getting a new job yet. We talked for a bit and I think I calmed her down and she ended the conversation by saying she didn't really know what to talk about anymore so we would talk later. I ended up texting her later in the evening and I asked her about her comment. I was upfront and said she had said that a couple of times and if she would prefer that we didn't talk as much and if I should just leave her alone for a bit. She responded with an I don't know. I let her know that that wasn't very helpful and she responded by saying that she does want to keep talking but she is shy, insecure and a little scared about continuing to talk. I told her I got the part about being shy and insecure but didn't understand the scared part. I asked her if it had to do with her being scared that if we kept talking this much that it this would turn into something more than us just being friends and her not being ready for that. She  replied with I think it could be that. 

I fell asleep before she replied so did not see it till the morning. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I would like to go further with our relationship and it seems like she might as well, just is unsure about herself. I guess I am looking for advice on 2 things, one how to respond to that and two, do I pursue this? Or am I just looking into this too much and should leave it alone.

241,caltgi,just_another_ux_,My brother in law was inappropriate with my wife and we don't know how to handle it,"Throwaway account.

This happened last week, I just found out about it because my wife is super embarrassed about the whole thing and wanted some time to process it on her own.

I've never gotten along well with my BIL. My wife however, has tried to have a relationship with him and over the last few years they've hung out a couple of times.

Last week, he invites my wife to go out racing with him (he does some autocross thing at the track). I told her that I'm not comfortable with it as he has made some inappropriate comments towards her in the past, but she brushed it off (she thinks the best of everybody) and decided to go anyways.

The day of, he sends her a text with a half-naked woman leaning against a race car with something like ""In case you're having trouble deciding what to wear..."" She just brushed it off as a joke and went to meet him anyways.

At the event, she had to go to the washroom and as she was walking away, he slapped her ass. When that happened, she turned around and told him not to do that.

Later, after they had parted ways, she gets another text message from him saying something like ""thanks for coming, I really liked having you beside me...""

It's blatantly obvious to her that he was coming onto her. I'm furious and want to go hit the prick, but I also don't want to get myself into trouble because he's an ass.

We both feel that she needs to tell her sister about this, but obviously it's uncomfortable, and she doesn't have a great relationship with her sister.

243,calsox,shalom1423,Feel really undesirable and it‚Äôs messing with my relationship,"My boyfriend and I have been together for just over a year, and have lived together for 6 months. At the beginning of our relationship our sex life was active and exciting, and although I know that always drops off a little bit in long term/serious relationships, it feels like he doesn‚Äôt want anything these days and it‚Äôs really messing with my self esteem. 

I‚Äôve raised it a number of times, and he normally tells me I‚Äôm wrong, he does find me attractive etc. When I try and raise situations that made me feel otherwise he will tell me I‚Äôm just trying to start an argument or I‚Äôm ignoring things that have happened in the past. 

For instance, the other day we were play fighting in bed and I was straddling him, topless with a new sexy bra on. I was sitting on his crotch so would‚Äôve felt if he was turned on, but he definitely wasn‚Äôt and despite staying in bed and playing games for an hour or so after that nothing happened. When I rose it as an example of why I feel undesirable to him, he straight up told me he was turned on. I said I know you weren‚Äôt because I was paying attention but if you were why didn‚Äôt you do anything about it. He didn‚Äôt really have a response to that other than to tell me I‚Äôm ignoring times that contradict how I feel. 

He often compliments me but it feels like there‚Äôs not much sexual attraction anymore. We have sex probably 2 times a week, which I know isn‚Äôt infrequently compared to some situations but it feels like it only ever happens when I initiate. I‚Äôm feeling unsatisfied, unattractive and overall stupid for thinking that somebody would be excited to be with me. 

As I mentioned, I‚Äôve raised it multiple times and he‚Äôs said he‚Äôll try to put more effort in but it never changes. I love and trust him, but I can‚Äôt help but be terrified that somethings going on that I don‚Äôt know about because I don‚Äôt understand how things could just slow down so much if he still finds me attractive like he says. 

I‚Äôve been in so many relationships where I lose my interest in sex and that‚Äôs the first sign I‚Äôm falling out of love with them and I can‚Äôt help but feel like that‚Äôs the case here. 

For reference, we‚Äôre both young and healthy, neither of us are on any medication that should impact libido and at least from my point of view neither of us are suffering from any kind of mental health issues at the moment. In the past few months I‚Äôve gained 5-6kg which is already messing with my self esteem. I don‚Äôt know what to do because bringing it up seems to start arguments but I‚Äôm just sitting around waiting and being disappointed if I don‚Äôt say anything.",2019-07-08 14:34:16,1,0,relationship_advice
244,calsn9,User02023,[UPDATE] I (24M) slept with my boss (44F) of 5 years.,"My original post was locked down and removed because I didn‚Äôt ask for specific advice. I asked for general advice and personal scenarios because I didn‚Äôt know how to go about things. This was roughly a week ago and I‚Äôll give a quick rundown because I‚Äôm not sure if people can still look at the post.

I landed a job when I was 19, where I met my boss. We worked together closely for 2 years, and due to department changes she switched areas. We were in different departments for 6 months. Her team lead was fired for some mess ups and she told me I‚Äôd be a good fit for the position. I applied and got the job where I have been a team lead under her for a little over 2 years. We made a great team and she has gone through a ton, including a divorce. They have two kids together (17M) (20M). We talk about personal things because we are close friends, but one night during a post shift dinner she confessed to having some feelings for me. Well we hooked up, and she cried afterwards. This was a first for me so I just tried to be comforting. We ended up hooking up again two nights later, she cried again. We didn‚Äôt talk about us at first, or the situation we were in.

The advice I should have asked the first time around to prevent a lockdown was:

Is it worth pursuing?

What should I be prepared for?

What steps should I take to ensure this doesn‚Äôt goof with our jobs?

Instead I asked for general advice which many of you gave out, the post blew up way more than I thought it would. Our situation was more in depth in the first post so I apologize for details left out but I wanted to focus more on the update.

Many of you said don‚Äôt dip your pen in the company ink, don‚Äôt shit where you eat, etc. I wholeheartedly understand the gravity of the situation now, but not necessarily in a bad way. A lot has happened since our initial encounter. I went over to her place so we could chat, I wanted to get to the bottom of whatever was going on. She has always been such a sweetheart, so I didn‚Äôt believe she would have any malicious intent. Sure enough she didn‚Äôt. I am very quiet for the most part, and although I‚Äôm young I seem to be ahead of my peers on the maturity scale. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, not socially awkward or anything, but if I don‚Äôt have a place to say anything I just listen. Plus there is more knowledge to gain from listening than there ever will be from speaking. She told me I made her feel young, sexy, and I had been there to listen to her hardships. According to her that‚Äôs something she hasn‚Äôt felt in a long time. She admits guilt because I‚Äôm so much younger than her. Even though it doesn‚Äôt bother me in the slightest. I had one last question that had me itching, so I asked her if she wanted to pursue a relationship. She does, and I do too. I‚Äôm very emotionally invested in her, more so than girls I‚Äôve dated recently. She let me know she was vulnerable, and didn‚Äôt want to hold me back. Also, she told me that at any point I could leave, and didn‚Äôt want me to continue if I wasn‚Äôt emotionally involved. I just said I was more than willing, and that I care about her deeply.

All seems very nice and sweet but the only thing left to talk about it work. We discussed what we should do, she insisted I don‚Äôt leave the department. I understood where she was coming from because we work extremely well together. However I knew that would be the wrong move, and if someone found out we would be toast. We talked about it on and off all day. She is upset that I‚Äôm looking to leave her department but knows it‚Äôs the right call. So we agreed that we would disclose it to HR and move forward. We decided to enjoy the 4th, and come back Friday prepared to disclose. The 4th was awesome, we spent all day together, and I met her son (17M). It was awkward for me at first. Luckily for me it was only briefly, he had plans with friends and we had our own plans. He seems like a nice kid, kinda nerdy; we talked for a little bit. Pretty much he just said ‚Äúwhatever man, my mom is happy.‚Äù (Heavy paraphrasing). Her and I talked about that whole situation, she assured me her 20 year old would not be that inviting. So I‚Äôm still looking forward to that one. We watched fireworks that night on a sprawled out blanket and stayed back after most people left. We just enjoyed talking about who we were outside of work, who we want to be, what we wanted to be, etc. (mosquitoes suck). Fast forward to Friday morning, we go straight to HR after we get the crew off on their own. We spoke with the HR manager, pretty much told him the deal. We had to write statements saying what happened. Neither one of us put anything incriminating about the other as far as who made advances first or anything. We just made it as mutual as possible on paper. We went back to work for a few hours until she was called up to the board room up front. She was in there for a little bit. When she came back it was my turn. I walked into a handful of people. GM, AGM, HR Manager, Ops. They started talking to me as I was sitting in the hot seat across from all of them. Turns out the reason we had to write statements is because they had someone come to HR saying they thought something was going on between us. So they said they reviewed our statements and determined that nobody was being coerced or intimidated into this relationship. They asked if that was a true statement, I said yes. In their words when other people notice it first, it means it‚Äôs affecting the workplace which creates an issue for them. I was asked if it was worth it, I said yes. The AGM (probably the most straight up of all of them) told me that I was being considered for an area manager position that is about to open up with someone who is being promoted. I was going to take their spot if I accepted. He informed me that I can no longer be considered, and due to circumstances they can‚Äôt have me in a lead position anymore. They told me to finish out the day and that I‚Äôd be suspended for a week while they make room for me in Quality (different department). The asked me if it was still worth it, I said yes. It sucks serious ass, but had I said no that would‚Äôve crushed her had it gotten back to her. A small part of me says not worth it, because I took a nice pay cut, shut out of a promotion, and will be back to floor level in another department. On the other than I will have her romantically, and as more than a boss; which makes it all worth it. Still sucks though, internal battle haha.

They also made it clear that she shall have no saying in my progression, and I shall have no saying in her department. If either of those are breached they will can us both and call it a day. We have done a lot of good so that‚Äôs why they kept us, but backhanded with ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make us regret it.‚Äù I am eligible to become a lead again in a year, so long as she is not my superior.

When I got back to the floor we talked about what we dealt with in the board room. I guess they told her the same stuff and guilt tripped her for putting my career on hold. She keeps her position, but has no say in my development with the company any more. She was pretty tore up and kept apologizing, I told her that it was alright, and that I chose her. I finished my shift as team lead Friday. I am now on a week ‚Äúvacation‚Äù that consists of updating my resume and applying to other jobs. If there is nothing that takes off at least I still have my job. Since all this we have been seeing each other more regularly.

Things could‚Äôve gone way worse, so I‚Äôm grateful that it turned out the way it did. We are going to continue dating, and see where this goes. Even if it‚Äôs only long enough to pull her up and dust her off then I‚Äôm happy. She‚Äôs an amazing woman, and she deserves to know that for the first time in a long time.

THANK YOU ALL FOR THE ADVICE! The only thing I can say in rebuttal is don‚Äôt dip your pen in the company ink, unless you really like the company ink! I am retiring this throwaway because the problem is solved, thank you all again!",2019-07-08 14:34:10,2,4,relationship_advice
245,calsem,no_one_lies,I (24M) am uncomfortable with my girlfriend‚Äôs (21F) relationship with her friend/teammate (21M). Looking for an outside perspective.,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for half a year now. For the most part things have been going really well between us and there has been no major issues until just recently. I graduated school about a year ago and started working at an office near my girlfriend‚Äôs campus which is where we met. My girlfriend is captain of the fencing team at her university. The team is coed and led by a pair of co-captains, a girl and a guy. The other captain, Jason, is the guy in question. 

I understand being co-captains and teammates you end up spending a lot of time together and via social media I can tell they‚Äôve been friends for quite a while. I have never had an issue with Jason (although I only met him one time) he seemed like a nice guy. Jason has a history of only dating girls on the fencing team.  About a month before my girlfriend and I started seeing each other Jason and his girlfriend (who has since graduated and moved away) broke up. A few weeks after the break up, Jason flew to my girlfriend‚Äôs house (several states away) during their fall break to hangout. It was two weeks after the fall break we started seeing each other and didn‚Äôt officially start dating until January. According to my girlfriend, nothing happened. However, I only pressed for details of his visit after the incident and during our subsequent conversation which I asked a lot of questions about their history, so she may have had incentive to be elusive. 

The entirety of our relationship my girlfriend has been complaining to me about Jason being ‚Äòmoody‚Äô. There are two categories his moodiness falls into. Either he‚Äôs being snappy with my girlfriend or he is begging for her attention. Like during parties he begs her to stay out longer and then becomes rude if she leaves. Like I said earlier, I only met him one time. He didn‚Äôt seem interested at all in talking to me, only said hi. But from his group interactions at the party he seemed like a charismatic guy. 

Now to the incident. My girlfriend and I have been long distance for over a month now (which sucks), and recently she posted a picture on IG. Jason commented, ‚ÄúLook at that LEG. You are so hot.‚Äù I was caught off-guard just by brazen nature of the comment. He made comments like that on her other posts but nothing this forthcoming. It wasn‚Äôt until that comment that I felt insecure and began analyzing their relationship. I told my girlfriend that his comment made me uncomfortable in tandem with his past behavior, and her response was ‚ÄúWe are just friends. And friends complimenting friends is normal.‚Äù It was after this response I started asking questions about them hanging out after the break up and his reaction to her leaving parties‚Ä¶probably not the best move but I wasn‚Äôt in the best headspace. 

Now I don‚Äôt know what to do and am still *very* insecure. I know I can‚Äôt control who my girlfriend talks to, but now thinking about it, it‚Äôs so obvious to me this guy has a crush on her. Maybe it‚Äôs also just the insecurity of us being long distance recently and knowing they are going to be spending a lot of time together next year, but I feel helpless. Like do I just ride it out and see what happens? My girlfriend hasn‚Äôt done anything wrong. And now bringing up my insecurities to her I feel like I gave her more incentive to not tell me about her relationship/interactions with Jason (so I feel dumb on top of being insecure).

**TL:DR: A guy my girlfriend spends a lot of time with started openly macking on her on social media and making me feel insecure. After the conversation with my girlfriend I am even more insecure. What are my next steps? I hate this feeling.**",2019-07-08 14:33:35,3,1,relationship_advice

248,calr79,horriblepersonTM,I'm (24F) scared my boyfriend (28M) will become suicidal or depressed if I break up with him.,"Throwaway account, first post ever. I (24F) want to break up with my boyfriend (28M) but I‚Äôm afraid of what will happen to him if I do. We have been together for over 3 years and I have always had my doubts but we love each other so much that I have either ignored the doubts or haven‚Äôt gone through with the breakup. He is an amazing guy, treats me like a princess, loves me more than I could ever imagine anyone loving me (except my parents), amazing job, really smart and handsome, amazing family and we have the same values. But oddly enough I have never truly felt happy with him, but I have always been super in love (I know that doesn‚Äôt make sense but it‚Äôs the truth, I know i'm horrible). Part of the reason I never end up breaking up with him is I‚Äôm afraid I will break his heart into a million pieces. He lives in a new city, has no friends or family around him, we have been mostly long distance and he's already feeling quite lonely. The only person he talks to other than his coworkers is me (on Skype, after work), he is very introverted. I have been living in England for a few months for study abroad and we were planning on living together after that, made plans to get a pet, etc. He recently came to visit me and although it was a great time, overall I didn‚Äôt feel satisfied. We have very different sex drives (mine is much much higher, I feel like his is sometimes nonexistent), which is part of the problem, but not all of it. We are just too different, we want to live in different places, do different things. I want to break up, but he‚Äôs all alone, I am his best friend and we have been together for so long and I know it will come out of nowhere for him. I don‚Äôt want him to get depressed or suicidal. I don‚Äôt know what to do and the guilt is killing me. I don‚Äôt want to destroy him. All I want is for him to be happy with a girl that can truly appreciate how amazing he is.

249,calr3r,KINGxDUKES,"Me (20 M) and this girl (21) hooked up when we knew we shouldn‚Äôt have, and now we want to do it again.","So a little bit of context for you all. My freshman year of college I met this girl (call her girl A) who was incredible. Our chemistry was outrageous, and I quickly grew feelings for her. After about a year, half way through my sophomore year she finally gave me a chance. She finally gave me a chance and we were a thing for a short period of time until she went back to the guy she broke up with for me. I was truly hurt by it and cut her off for some period of time. She had been my best friend leading up to that so eventually when I was ready I reached out to her and now we are pretty close friends again. She even told one of our mutual friends she was still in love with me a couple months ago. Now whenever and her became friends I also became friends with her roommate which also happened to be her best friend(girl B). 

Fast forward to the beginning of summer this year. (Going into my senior year of college now) My roommate who also happens to be a very close friend of mine started hooking up with girl B. They never really became anything serious but there were definitely some feelings between them. She ended things with him before she went abroad because ‚Äúshe didn‚Äôt see it working out‚Äù according to her. 

She got back from Europe about a week ago. Last Friday we went out and met at some bars downtown. After a couple drinks we ended up going home together and having amazing sex which has now led us to wanting to continue.  However we both feel very guilty. I feel guilty due to the history my roommate and her have. She feels guilty due to the history her roommate and I have. I told her she doesn‚Äôt need to feel guilty about it because Girl A now has a boyfriend. And she‚Äôs telling me not feel bad about my roommate because they were never anything serious and she was the one that ended it. 

Now we‚Äôre not sure what to do. We want to keep hooking up but we don‚Äôt want to ruin our friendships with our close friends. Are we wrong for doing this or are we overthinking it? Sorry if those post kinda seems all over the place I‚Äôm not good at explaining myself. Feel free to ask questions.",2019-07-08 14:30:39,4,2,relationship_advice
250,calqgs,-SquidLord-,"My mum [48F] keeps bringing up a past manipulative relationship of mine [19F], or any other personal information, whenever we get into a disagreement.","Exactly as the title says. 

When I left my ex, my mother was there for me, and I really appreciated it. She helped me see it isn‚Äôt normal for a guy to want your passwords/ to see your bank balance, or to play games like ‚Äòmercy‚Äô with you when you don‚Äôt want to, or to scream in your face and act like it‚Äôs your fault.

We had a disagreement because she is teaching me her mother tongue (never had the chance to really learn it, unlike my Dad‚Äôs language which I‚Äôm semi-fluent in) and she became frustrated when I asked for an explanation following a grammatical correction. I asked her my question, and she snapped that I could just buy a grammar book and look it up, and that my query wasn‚Äôt specific enough. After this mini-rant, she went on to answer my question perfectly, without any further clarification from me. I just said (in hindsight maybe this was a bit tongue in cheek) ‚ÄòWas that so hard?‚Äô and told her I didn‚Äôt understand why she become so annoyed when I was just asking for help (I had never used the phrase I got wrong in this context). I frequently help her with things she doesn‚Äôt understand first time around, especially technology and some other stuff, without making a fuss of it/ telling her she can buy a book about it. 

She stormed off. I left her be for a while to cool down. I then approached her because my Dad had asked me to help her with some kind of form, and she said ‚ÄòWhy don‚Äôt you try talking to [ex‚Äôs mum] like that?‚Äô. For context, my ex‚Äôs mother was always really kind to me and made me feel very welcome at a time I was arguing with my own mother a lot. She even asked me to wait for my ex to mature so he could redeem himself for what he did, to keep in contact etc, I haven‚Äôt spoken to her since I dumped her son. 

I just don‚Äôt understand why my mother always chooses to lash out in this way. Even when I was younger, she‚Äôd hold on to pieces of information and use them later. For example, I once told her in passing a friend kept chickens. One day I was cleaning, and she bursts in to remind me that I‚Äôm not as responsible as my friend who keeps chickens??? Or she‚Äôll say things like ‚ÄòWhat [ex] did was really messed up‚Äô, only for it to change to ‚ÄòYou deserved to be treated like that‚Äô when she gets mad at me for something. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do here. Of course I love and appreciate her so much, but it‚Äôs not fair that she changes her perspective so radically when she‚Äôs upset, and then acts surprised when I don‚Äôt tell her anything about my life (knowing it‚Äôll be used against me later). I‚Äôve never received an apology for any of these uses of personal information, because she insists whatever I‚Äôve done is worse. Having said this, she‚Äôs extremely apologetic when she hasn‚Äôt done anything wrong (e.g. accidentally bumps into me, or she‚Äôll apologise if I say I‚Äôm feeling tired or something). 

The issue is bigger than how it‚Äôs executed. My real problem is this history of using my personal life against me, rather than just her bringing up a painful past. Has anybody got advice on how to navigate this?",2019-07-08 14:29:09,1,1,relationship_advice
251,calq7n,mistyrain786,My (32F) younger brother (31M) is becoming increasingly paranoid of everyone around him and I'm not sure what to do..,"TLDR: younger brother has become increasingly paranoid over the last 8 months. He's blown up on us multiple times but this is the worst. everyone is worried for his mental health but does not know how to broach the subject.  

&amp;#x200B;

My (32F) younger brother (31M) is becoming increasingly paranoid and I‚Äôm not sure what to do about it. For a little bit of background: we‚Äôre 4 siblings, I have an older brother who‚Äôs 34. Growing up we experienced a lot of trauma, our parents not getting along and witnessing spousal abuse. My younger brother experienced a traumatic event when he was around 8 years old and he blames my older brother for it and now more than 20 years later continues to blame him. The way I see it, is we were all just kids and couldn‚Äôt be expected to fulfill the role that my parents should have been occupying all along. The rest of us understand that but for some reason younger brother does not. 

Over the last 8 months or so. I‚Äôve noticed he‚Äôs become increasingly paranoid. If we‚Äôre sitting in the same room and you happen to catch his eye, he‚Äôll say ‚Äúwhy were you looking at me like that‚Äù when there‚Äôs no motive behind it. He‚Äôs quit his last job after 6 months because he said people were ‚Äúmessing with him‚Äù when I asked him what that meant he said he knew they were congregating in groups and talking about him. He said he‚Äôs manager at that job made comments that insinuated he knew about our childhood situation which I find very unlikely.  He‚Äôs planning on going back to work, which I told him was a great idea to which he replied ‚ÄúI hope they don‚Äôt mess with me there‚Äù. He keeps thinking people everywhere are ‚Äúmessing with him‚Äù to the point that he‚Äôs now questioning his family. 

So fast forward to 2 days ago ‚Äì we went out as a family with some new family friends, we had a large group of 14 so were required to split up into separate tables at the restaurant we went to. Older brother sat with one of the guys of the group we were with. Younger brother sat at a table with someone else behind them. Younger brother yesterday messaged older brother and asked why older brother looked at him and kept smiling. Older brother said the looks were coincidental and had nothing to do with younger brother. Younger brother did not buy that explanation and said older brother was ‚Äúmessing with him‚Äù and the look he gave was ‚Äúmalicious‚Äù. Younger brother thinks older brother was talking trash about him with our family friend. Older brother did not appreciate this line of question and let‚Äôs just say their conversation spiraled out of control with younger brother blowing his lid and cursing older brother off and telling him to eff off. Older brother took the high road and did not curse at him but told younger brother that they should maintain distance between each other.  

There‚Äôs a lot more nuanced detail that I may be missing here but in short, younger brother thinks everyone is against him including the people in his own family. In the exchange with older brother he brought up a lot of old childhood issues and said he protected older brother from a lot of the shit that happened in our childhood. 

I‚Äôm at a loss of what to do. Younger brother barely has any friends and keeps isolating himself from the family. We have tried to be understanding but I agree with older brother that there‚Äôs only so much questioning of your motives that you can take before you lose your cool. I do believe that there‚Äôs a mental health component to it but don‚Äôt know how to approach the subject with younger brother without putting him on the defensive. Any advice would be appreciated.",2019-07-08 14:28:29,5,3,relationship_advice

256,calmww,penguinator_14,My ex girlfriend (21F) is confused about getting back together with me (20M),"My ex girlfriend of 1.5 years broke up with me back in March because she did not see a future with me. After a month of NC we started hanging out again, and she admitted she still loves me and was thinking about getting back together. We even spent a weekend together at a hotel and had a great time. She told me she misses me, and often feels very strongly about getting back together....but also sometimes feels we still shouldn't. She seems very confused and goes back and forth about me. I don't even know why she started thinking about getting back together considering she was very adamant about breaking up.

However she told me she also started dating again (but gets jealous when I do?) and I told her I couldn't stick around anymore and be a backup, and I want us to not be in contact while she clears her head about me. It was too painful for me. She's going to get in touch with me in the fall when we're back at college with a decision I assume (we're long distance over the summer)

Now I'm just living in fear of her answer, I feel more pain than before, and I don't know how to cope. I don't know if what I did was right or not and I just wish I could have her back....

257,calmea,Ihopediwouldbebetter,I need help. I [23M] feel so close to ruining everything by cheating,"Throw away for fairly obvious reasons.

My girlfriend [23F] and I [23M] have been together for a little over 3 and a half years now and I still love her more than anyone else in the world. She is also the only relationship I've ever been in, so my experience on how to handle certain things is extremely limited.

The problem is that because of work/graduate school, we end up being separated for significant spans of time. This last year was the worst so far as we were only able to see eachother for a 3 month span out of the entire year. This is especially difficult for me because as my girlfriend states, my ""love language"" is almost exclusively physical and I struggle to connect communicating over the phone to actually communicating with her. This leads me to feel extremely alone and depressed during these separations and also is causing me to develop a drinking problem.

Here's where the immediate problem actually starts. We are currently in the middle of another 5 month separation and I am 2 weeks into a program in Europe (she and both live in the US) working on my PhD (I appologize for the vagueness, but I worry it would be too identifiable if I was more specific). There was this girl in the program with me who seemed to be very flirty with me since the start, but I initially just assumed it was her personality. Ill call her Jessica [21F]. I know that I had at least mentioned to her that I had a girlfriend back home. 

Last night, Jessica came to my place and tried to hook up with me. I told her I couldn't and when she asked why I hesitated for way too long. I don't know why it was such a struggle to remind her that I had a girlfriend, but it only came out after I wrestled with my words for what felt like minutes. She said fine and that she'd see me tomorrow. When she was getting her things together to leave and I realized I actually wanted her to stay. I held my tongue long enough for her to leave without me stopping her.

I didn't sleep at all last night. I just sat in bed drinking and feeling horrible for how close I was to cheating. But by morning I had realized something that's made me feel sick the whole day: if she comes back tonight, I don't think I'll be able to say no again. The guilt and shame I would feel after would literally kill me, but I'm so worried I won't do the right thing next time.

Before people start jumping down my throat for this, I'm not asking whether I'm the asshole here, because I obviously am. I'm just hoping someone has advice to save me from being the asshole.

When I saw her today, she was acting even more flirty than usual and was more touchy (nothing directly sexual, things like holding me by the arm to talk to me), and I think that she can tell that I'm not as firm on the ""no, I have a gf"" thing as I was even last night.

Part of me wants me to just scream at her to leave me alone, another part wants to give her exactly what she wants, and another part just wants me to just drink myself into a coma to escape from all this.

I know what I should do, I just can't bring myself to do it. 

Please, if anyone has any advice how to save me from myself, I need it desperately.

258,calm8l,throwaway678990,My gf [F22] never wants to cook or even help me [F20] cook and it's starting to affect our relationship.,"Throwaway as she knows my main account. 

We've been dating for six months. Every so often I come over to her house and stay a couple weeks as we don't see each other that often so it's the only time we get together.

Everytime I stay I have offered to cook food because she not that great at cooking and usually gets pre-cooked frozen  meals so it's nice to have something home cooked once in a while.

In the beginning she would help and watch me cook as she wanted to learn  to cook some of the things I made. she'd listen, ask questions and then try make it on a later day and it always turned out good which made her happy. Sometimes she'd just cut vegetables and do the little things I ask her to do.

Then after a while I suggested that maybe she could maybe cook the food next week and I told her something super easy to cook and told her the steps, what to get and encouraged her. At first she was excited and I was glad to get a break from always cooking. I would have done the same thing she did for me every time I cooked by doing the little things.

Next week comes around and she's just decided that she doesn't want to cook. Fine by me but I'm exhausted from cooking all 7 days the week before so I said that I could put some frozen food on. She gets upset because she wants the dish she was going to make but she wants me to cook it.

I stand my ground and said no. She eventually gave in and decided to cook but said I had to hang around just in case she needs help

The whole time she complains about how the dish she's making is too hard, there's too many steps, this doesn't look right, maybe you should take over, etc. She started asking questions that made it seem like she didn't know what she was doing and I knew she was doing it on purpose to try get me to take over but instead I just encouraged her. 

Then she just gave up, left the stove on with the food still cooking and stood next me to me and said she doesn't want to cook anymore. I told her that if she wanted this dish she had to cook it she can't give up and it was going so well etc. She then just laughed it off and said I should cook it. I didn't want the food to go to waste so I did. 


The next day she asked if I wanted to cook something today I said sure as there was something I actually wanted to cook. I asked her to cut vegetables and she was cutting them really slowly and complained and said I should do it because she's tired and doesn't want to and went into the living room to watch TV. 

She was fine up until she had to help me cook. I was annoyed  and everytime I came into the living room to rest for a little bit in between cooking she'd make remarks of ""shouldn't you be watching the food"" and then just laugh it off. I even asked her to watch it for a second as I felt sick and she again laughed, said no and walked off.

She did that every day that week. Doesn't want to help, refuses to cook and say that it's because she likes my cooking but she's tired (she's had most of last week off work and has been at home just watching tv). I snapped and told her that I don't want to cook anymore, I'm tired from cooking and that I'm here to spend time with her not just here to cook for her and I might as well go home now if that's all she wants me here for. She apologised and just like that, no discussion just end of the conversation.

This happened over the last two weeks and since last thursday I haven't really spoke to her, I'm annoyed and I wanted to discuss it and hopefully she'd understand but she wants to just drop it. She knows I'm mad and not talking to her. She suggested to cook on Sunday until she decided that it was too much work and asked if I'd want to cook anything and I just said no. 

It's not like she's trying to cook its she just wants me to do it. I feel like the only reason she wanted me here is to cook for her. This is affecting our relationship and me asking her to try and help is only going to make her complain a lot about how much work it is and I'll just have take over. I haven't cooked at all since Thursday and shes asked me twice if I'd want to and both times I've said no and she just looks annoyed.

How do I even explain this to her? It's just like she doesn't consider my feelings or the effort that goes into cooking which is why it's nice if she cooks sometimes or helps",2019-07-08 14:19:20,4,2,relationship_advice

260,caljgi,97-throwaways,What to do about an old high school acquaintance [21/F] who seems to be competing with me [21/F] ?,"Back in HS, Laura and I were okay. I am a very friendly and sociable person, so whenever she was around, or any acquaintance was around, I‚Äôd treat them as if they were my friends. Her and I had some problems over a senior art project, but besides that - her and I were cool and cordial. After graduating high school, her and I didn‚Äôt really keep in contact; I didn‚Äôt really have a reason to but she was on all of my social medias. 


I went to college upstate, she went to college back home. Her and I never talked during my college years‚Ä¶ However, during my junior year in college, I start dating this great guy and that is when Laura starts to talk to me. I had some problems over that summer (august 2018) at home and my boyfriend who was states away, offered his home. 




I am a avid snap-chatter, someone who likes to collect and share memories. So while at his home, I snapchat the day &amp; Laura asks me on Snapchat if my boyfriend had a brother or cousin. 




I did think it was weird that a person who I barely know or spoke to asked that question, but it was a joke. I didn‚Äôt take it that deep, but that opened an ENTIRE CAN OF WORMS. 




Ever since then, Laura has been keeping me updated on her love life. First, she was telling me about a bunch of guys she was talking to, asking questions about my relationship and sharing details/pictures I didn‚Äôt really need to know. I assumed Laura didn‚Äôt have many friends or anyone close enough to talk to, so I talked to her when I could. Her stories sounded fabricated but who was I to really say anything. Our conversations were about nothing but how I was, how my boyfriend was and about her relationships. I‚Äôd try to ask questions and talk about other things but she'd always go back to talking about men. 



Laura starts dating this guy, Julius. That‚Äôs when the conversation starts feeling really weird. It seems like she is unnecessarily butting the conversation with Julius; asking me questions about my bf and then sort of comparing them. Making snide comments about her family getting along with Julius, and how my family doesn‚Äôt get along with my bf. Commenting on snaps of my bf living his life &amp; her saying how he looks like he doesn‚Äôt care. ALL with a condescending ‚Äúlol‚Äù. 




Or, she‚Äôll hit me up and it doesn‚Äôt really seem like the conversation is going anywhere, so I‚Äôll stop replying (really, what are you supposed to say to lmao?) and she‚Äôll send another text bragging about Julius. 









It just feels like I‚Äôm in some catty competition with her that I never signed up for. And it has been going on for months. Just yesterday, she hit me up to tell me she was on a cruise. Nice. She asks me about my cruise next year, a new ship that just came out, and she then goes on about how her family is going on a new cruise too and how her stepfather invited her boyfriend. 





It took me a while to realize that some of her behavior screams jealousy. When telling my friends, they brought this to my attention but I really don‚Äôt feel like I have anything to be jealous of‚Ä¶ If that makes sense. You can TELL when someone is genuinely excited about sharing their life and experiences and someone who is just bringing it up to brag. Why would someone I barely know go out of their way to brag and compare her life/partner with mine?





What do I do? I don‚Äôt want to be petty like my friends are suggesting and I also don‚Äôt want to insult her. I would like to continue being friendly but this whole competing and comparing is just not what I want to keep doing. 






**TL;DR: Old HS acquaintance that I have barely talked to after graduating, has been comparing her life / partner with mine, bragging and it feels like I‚Äôm in a competition with her. What can I do to stop it without being rude, petty or mean?**",2019-07-08 14:12:56,3,2,relationship_advice
261,caljeq,coollemonade7,What do you define as emotional cheating.,"I met my boyfriend through a dating app. About two months before we met, he started talking to other girl from the site that lived about an hour away. Even though they never met in person they continued talking almost daily including after we began dating. I didn't say anything at first because I didn't want it to come across that I didn't approve of him talking to other girls but eventually the secrecy (never opening his messages if I was able to see, locking his laptop/phone when he left the room etc) got to me and I had to ask.  I asked what they talk about and if I could read their conversations, he told me they tell each other all of the things they don‚Äôt want to talk to their in real life friends about and didn't want to bother me with and that the thought of me reading their conversation makes him uncomfortable, so instead he just sent me a screenshot that included them talking about me and our relationship as 'evidence' he wasn't pretending to be single. He was quite defensive, saying they were just friends and the fact they had never met meant I had nothing to worry about.  **I believe they have never met so its not that I believe he is literally cheating on me, but do I have a right to feel betrayed that he is sharing his inner thoughts, feelings and problems with this woman including details about our relationship, rather then with his own partner. It is definitely making me realise my boyfriend and I aren‚Äôt as close as I thought.**

&amp;#x200B;

Also I do not understand why they haven't met? If they really were just friends wouldn't you think they would arrange to hang out  as two friends would, like the three of us could do something together if they were really just friends right.... The fact in over a year they have never met makes me think that even he thinks the two of them hanging out in real life would be inappropriate and if they ever met they could potentially be more then friends. 

Would you spend over a year of your time getting to know a very attractive girl very personally if you honestly had no intentions or romantic feelings for her?",2019-07-08 14:12:49,6,1,relationship_advice
262,cali8t,sitka7000,Loves me like a sister or more?,"I‚Äôm f in my 30‚Äôs. He‚Äôs one of my best friends. He knows pretty much everything that‚Äôs going on in my life. Probably too much. I get these ‚Äúcrushes‚Äù on him from time to time that get stronger each time. Or perhaps it‚Äôs always been in the back of my mind and I just quash it b/c it‚Äôs never been the right time- we‚Äôve never really been single at the same time etc. Though now I think he just knows too much of my flaws. üò¨

So he says he loves me like a sister. That‚Äôs how we introduce ourselves to people and explain why we are often together at many events. But we‚Äôre pretty cuddly from time to time- how much do siblings cuddle? I don‚Äôt really touch my actual siblings. We‚Äôre each other‚Äôs standing dates to things like weddings. He‚Äôs my emergency contact. I know we love each other.... like siblings? I have not been interested in him before. Then I have. Throughout the time I‚Äôve known him, I‚Äôve been in a string of failed relationships. I have my bad patterns. I choose men that are emotionally unstable and need moms. He likes the emotionally unavailable women that look like his mom.

Currently- I‚Äôm trying to get out of a relationship where the guy is living in my home and I‚Äôm having trouble getting him out. (Story for another Reddit).  He and his ex broke up awhile ago and is single again and dating. 

He is just starting date someone he likes and I think she‚Äôll be good for him b/c she likes him and is emotionally available and has her shit together. etc. 

I know I need to get my relationship shit together and be single for awhile before having another romantic relationship. And I really don‚Äôt want to be rejected from my bff. Moreso, I don‚Äôt want to be a shitty friend and say something when I know he has someone good in the fire. But these feelings are getting to me. Do I say something now or eat up these feelings and deal with them inside myself? Is it timing?- a talk for later? Or should I read the ‚Äúlove you like a sister‚Äù but also like the closeness as he loves me as someone close, there‚Äôs some attraction but he doesn‚Äôt want to date me because I clearly have my relationship shit not in order enough and it‚Äôs too late to ever go back... and I just need to quietly accept it and move on?",2019-07-08 14:09:58,1,1,relationship_advice
263,cali7u,throwie08,I just discovered that my recovering porn addict boyfriend is watching porn again. How should I go about this?,"My boyfriend [27M] and I [23F] have been together for almost 5 years now. In the past, we had a lot of problems with him not really wanting to have sex with me, never initiating and often rejecting me. He lied about it for a long time, but after he finally admitted that it was because of porn.

He promised me that he will stay away from porn and as I saw I, he actually did and our sex life became much better.

However, today, I turned on his laptop, not because I wanted to spy on him or anything, mine was just doing a really long virus scan. On the fist page of the browser, there is this highlights thing that shows the often or recently visited websites. It was full of porn.

I don't know what to do now. He will get home soon and I don't know how to confront him. Should I ask him and hope that he will be honest? I'm not sure if I could deal with him lying to me again. Should I just straight out tell him that I know he watches?

264,calhhe,isthisthrowawayokay,I have an amazing relationship but am to insecure to enjoy it. Should I end it?,"Sorry for the long one so, tldr; I always imagine my girlfriend cheating on me, even though she's never given me any reason to believe it.

I've been in a number of relationships in the past, some short term and some slightly longer (2-3 years). I've always been confident in all of them, never jealous and never the type to overthink.

The last couple short term relationships however, have ended both with me being cheated on.

I spent a while single, working in a job that requires me to be very socially active and in that time I met a lot of people, had a lot of fun and moved on. Still very confident and socially engaged.

6 months ago I met an amazing girl, we spend as much time as we can together and she has been always very open, honest and caring towards me. I love her, and we have been planning our future together. She has never given me any reason to distrust her in any way... Which is why my own mind if really fucking with me right now.

We live apart and are both very socially active. Our jobs require us to host parties and drink with our guests so we do spend most evenings mingling and meeting new people all of the time.

Although I really feel in my heart that she would always be honest, my brain constantly tries to force me to overthink our relationship. What happens if she drinks too much and makes a mistake? What happens if she gets too drunk when I'm not there and something bad happens?

I can't escape my own distrust, I think largely because of my previous experiences, and I wonder if just ending it all and going back to being single would make me happier now, and saving her the heartbreak of my insecurity later. I want to talk to her, but if I keep just expressing these insecurities eventually she will just get tired of constantly reassuring me and leave anyway?

265,calgq4,MoniezTipsPlz,Can enthusiasm appear when it wasn't there before? Boyfriend very non-committal when discussing the future.,"Posted on r/AskWomen but it got locked.

27F with 29M. Together just over 2 years.

Tried to discuss moving in together within the next year or so but was told he hadn't thought about it and refuses to entertain the idea. He cannot give me a rough estimate of when he will be ready to move in together (or ever). I asked if he was waiting for something to happen to solidify a decision or of he was waiting for someone better? Neither of us have ever lived with a partner before.

I was so excited to discuss this, but his response has filled me with dread.

He knows I want marriage and kids and knows if he didn't we would break up. I know he didn't have the best examples of happy marriages or childhood so I can see why he is perhaps hesitant.

I just wanted to hear anecdotes from others. Did the guy who was ""meh"" when discussing your future eventually get excited? What prompted it? I'm of the opinion that anything less than a ""hell yes!"" is a ""hell no"" and am slowly becoming resigned to the fact that I am perhaps not enough to ever elicit such a response from my boyfriend.

How long am I supposed to wait to see if suddenly he is excited for a future with me? I would have thought 2 years was long enough to know if you wanted to live with someone.

Edit for repost: probably get the same answers that I got in r/AskWomen before it was locked and thinking that even if I hear promising stories it'll be like in *He's Just Not That Into You* - I'm the rule, not the exception.",2019-07-08 14:06:24,4,2,relationship_advice

Thanks everyone for your support. I actually bumped into my ex-girlfriend at the birthday party of a friend a few days ago. I didn‚Äôt know she‚Äôd be there. She said hi to me like nothing was the matter. Like we hadn‚Äôt spent 2 years of our lives together. She looked great and I wish I hadn‚Äôt gone to the party. I was healing in my own time, just going to work and focusing on friends and family. But seeing her again was like opening an old wound.

After the party, she unblocked me and sent me a very long text. She said she was sorry for how she acted, that she just woke up one day when I was gone and realized that she didn‚Äôt want to be with me. Just like that. She said being in a relationship just exhausts her (she‚Äôs an introvert). She said she likes being by herself, without any drama or tears or stress. 

I said that‚Äôs fine, but she could have at least told me. She apologized to me again and said she was being a coward. She said she hates breaking up with people and said she was waiting for me to break up with her first.

I just think she got tired of me and didn‚Äôt even care enough about me to end it properly. So she just decided pretending I didn‚Äôt exist was the best way to do it. 

I can‚Äôt say hearing all this helps. I don‚Äôt really even have much closure. But people wanted me to update and so I did.

When we started dating I was still a virgin while she wasn't. I am totally fine with her having had a previous relationship and not being a virgin this doesn't bother me at all. However something she told me about her ex keeps coming to mind.

I have never been insecure about my penis before. I am a little above average and completely fine with that. She told me she is super happy with my size, that it's the perfect length for her and that before she saw my penis she was afraid of me maybe being huge since I am a very tall guy. But she said:

&gt;""I was expecting you to be too big since my ex was really tall too and his dick was way too big for me.""

I know her ex is an ex for a reason and I am not worried about him at all but that doesn't mean I want to know details like this. Is it weird for me to be insecure about her ex having a huge cock?

269,calerl,MangaSans,I(18M) am extremely close to traveling across the country to see my old teacher(31F) that I think I was in love with. How terrible of an idea is this?,"I'm a high school student doing my final year at a pretty snobby all boys school. Last year I was placed in an English class taught by an unbelievably kind, funny, intelligent and otherworldly beautiful teacher who I will call ""C"". We got along pretty great, but in the beginning it was just the standard teacher's pet answer every question type thing. That changed when I revealed to ""C"" that I was going through an intense period of anxiety and depression. She had experience in (and obviously was still going through)  something similar and she immediately got involved, becoming the only stabilizing and understanding figure in my life that wasn't getting paid to listen to me. We started chatting on WhatsApp, initially as a way for her to make sure I was okay. After a few weeks we were up at 5 in the morning sending each other memes and talking about how much we both hated the privileged assholes I shared a school with.


 I'm pretty sure I fell in love with her, despite the fact that she is married (not particularly happily but married nonetheless) and had two children. It got to the point where I was spending hundreds of dollars on signed copies of books from her favorite author, she was telling me we were going to be best friends till I was 65, and the other staff members were questioning whether we were sleeping together. We were probably way too close, but there was no chance that I was passing up getting to know the smartest, most good natured, downright golden human being I had ever had the pleasure of knowing. Then we had a major fucking blowout fight.


""C"" could no longer take teaching at my school, with the perceived apathy of some of my classmates causing her extreme anxiety and depression. She had been reduced to tears both during class and in private whilst we were discussing how she was. She had enough of the mental torture and whilst I saw her decision to leave coming, the fact that she was moving across the country (A 13 hour drive) hit me hard. I blamed myself for not being enough of a friend to cancel out all the bullshit she was facing, and placed the blame firmly on myself. I didn't deal with this anger particularly well, and as ""C"" got closer and closer to leaving her anxiety got worse and worse. It all boiled over in us having a huge fight, started by my sheer ability to act just like the assholes we both hated, with the school psychiatrist and heads becoming involved. My capability to do my newly awarded prefect (Student Council) position which I had worked immensely hard for was jeopardized due to the mental meltdown I had after the fight. It ended with her essentially telling me that I was too much of a dickhead to know her, and blocking me on WhatsApp. That was 7 months ago.


Fast forward to today, as I break my streak of 9 months without self harm. As shitty as my mental health is right now, this year I've been working hard to be a person that ""C"" can be proud of, and accept back in to her life. She was the only person to ever feel as if there was something special about me as a human being and not a collection of achievements, and I'm so desperate to prove her initial thoughts right. I consistently find myself looking at plane tickets and am considering furthering my studies in the city she is. What should I do ?

Tl;Dr: Had a massive blowout fight with a teacher who I was utterly head over heels with just as she left her job and moved across the county. Should I go and see her ?",2019-07-08 14:02:12,13,1,relationship_advice

271,cale5c,poopfarts69,What are some ways I (30/F) can figure out what my strengths and weaknesses are when pursuing new relationships?,"Background: I‚Äôm 30/F and have been single since I was 26. Before that, I had one serious relationship in my early 20s that ended with a broken off engagement (I found out that he was cheating), and have had a few casual relationships after that which were great but in each one our attractions to each other just faded over time. I am introverted and absolutely love alone time, so I am by no means feeling lonely or desperate for a relationship. I don‚Äôt want children, so I‚Äôm not in a ‚Äúrush‚Äù for marriage either. I just simply feel like I would benefit from having a significant other in my life and want to be able to share life experiences with someone else, if I meet someone that I‚Äôm compatible with.

Here‚Äôs my problem: Almost every time I meet someone I am interested in, that is mutually interested in me, that interest tends to fade rather quickly on their part and I am not sure what exactly I am doing or saying that turns them off or pushes them away so quickly. I have a feeling I might come on too strong because I am pretty ‚ÄúType A‚Äù and tend to vehemently pursue the things (and people) that I want. Alternatively, I feel I may also sometimes do the opposite and seem too distant and uninterested due to my introverted tendencies. Perhaps it is both, and I am giving off mixed signals. Or, perhaps they just realize that they aren‚Äôt interested anymore after getting to know me better. Whatever the case may be, I usually find myself getting ‚Äúghosted‚Äù by guys after a short while (usually a month or two). I would really like to figure out not only what my weaknesses are in the dating field so I can work on remedying those problems, but also what my strengths are so I can continue to build upon those in healthy ways. I don‚Äôt by any means want to change my personality to fit what men desire, or fake who I am to please someone else. I simply want to learn healthy ways to improve on my habits and style of dating that might yield more success when pursuing future love interests.

274,calcyj,JHDog93,What is the proper way to Express to your S/O things that bother you without making her feel guilty because it clearly wasn't her fault?,"I (25M) know it's a confusion question, maybe I'm not as emotionally mature as I like to think I am but I want to grow for betterment of my relationship with my gf (24F).

We've been dating for about 10 months now and things a going great! We talk to each other about everything and we feel we can discuss out deepest darkest secrets. 

I'd say I'm good at expressing myself in a positive way. However I started to realize that i have trouble about telling people when they unintentionally hurt me, or I'll take things the wrong way and won't speak up about it. This typically isn't an issue with my friends or coworkers because I usually just swallow it and try to forget about it. But it really is starting to show in my relationship when my GF does something harmless but I'll internalize it negatively. 

I'll try to swallow it and forget about it or convince myself it's no big deal, but then I realized it just makes me bottle it up and we end up fighting about later on. An example is when she was studying for this big exam they only do once a year so she can get a certification for her job (being ambiguous for anonymity). We couldnt see each other a lot which was fine, but the sex was kinda lacking during that period of time. Instead of telling her how I felt, I just kinda let it linger and fester until I'll say something like ""I don't know why you dont want to have as much sex anymore"". Then she'll feel guilty that she's not doing her best in the relationship even though she's reasonably busy. Then I feel like an asshole because even though I told her how I felt, I made it seem like it was her fault and I waited this long to tell her.

I have been making progress on not bottling things up and telling her things that bug me in real time. But I still say it in a way that makes it seem like it's her fault. I hate that I do this. Another instance is when i wanted her to meet my teenage brother (10 years younger) and my cousin (roughly the same age as me). We were out hanging out at a park along with her best friend. Her best friend is a bachelorette, and wanted to meet a guy she met on tinder. The tinder guy and a buddy of his met up with us. They both seemed decent. It was getting late and they invited her best friend to the bar. I had an underaged person with me so we obviously couldnt join, but there was also nothing for is to do beside going to the bar at night so we decided to go home. My GF didn't want to leave her best friend alone with strangers so she stayed with her to make her safe. When we parted ways, I was texting her that I didn't like that her best friend invited a tinder date when the purpose of the night was to get to know my brother and cousin. And that it was inconsiderate to think it was okay to go to a bar leaving out my underaged baby brother. But again, it wasn't her fault that this happened but I expressed my thoughts in a way to make it feel like it was her fault even though she was just looking out for a friend. This lead another fight.

She tells me she understands why I would be upset about these things, but doesnt like that I make her feel guilty about. I want to be able to tell me gf things that doesnt sit well with me without making her feel guilty about it. Because she does it so much more eloquently than me. Shes more levelheaded and that's what makes her amazing.

Idk, am I just being immature? I know communication is vital, which I feel like I should tell her things that make me happy as well as things that bother me. Can I present these feelings in a way that doesn't put strain in the relationship?

TL;DR
I have a habit of telling things that bother me to my GF  but unintentionally making it seem like it's her fault. How can I break this habit but also Express these feelings?


Update:

Thank you all for your constructive critiques.
I realize what I'm doing is a form of manipulation and I never thought I'd be the type of person to be like this. I see I do a lot of blaming and I need to realize that something's are just out of our control.

276,calcjp,mootjeuh,My [25/m] girlfriend [33/f] wants to be added to my lease so she can enjoy my building's amenities,"Hi,  

So my girlfriend and I have been in a long-distance relationship for the past three months (we were friends for over a year before then). She has a remote job so she can work from just about anywhere, which is why she spends more time at my place than I at hers, usually two-three weeks at a time (we live ~300 miles apart).  

Now, the problem: she's a smoker, and usually goes on the rooftop whenever she needs to have a smoke. Property manager's found out about this, and has apparently instructed security/concierges to tell me that guests may only use the amenities when accompanied by a resident. Fair. Each condo building has their own rules so whatever.  

One of the concierges though suggested to her that I ask my landlord to add her to the lease, and poof, all problems solved. I don't know how I feel about this, as it would mean we're technically living together even though we're not. Never mind the possibility of the landlord increasing rent. Guess it stands to mention my lease is up in October and was planning on renewing it.  

So the question: am I making a big deal out of this? Is it really just as simple and convenient as adding a name on a piece of paper or does it have deeper-running ramifications?

Thanks in advance!",2019-07-08 13:56:49,4,3,relationship_advice
277,calc4k,Winendinen69,How can I [25F] become emotionally mature so I don't ruin my 3 year relationship with [28M]?,"Hi all,

BF and I have been together for 3 years, we moved across the country 9 months ago and have lived together since then. We've talked about marriage/our future and (originally) decided that we would get engaged after living together for a year.

We moved from the west coast to the east coast, and our lease is up in October, and I haven't been happy in our new state so there's a chance that we'll move back home.

For the most part since our move, our relationship has been good with the exception of some arguments we have had that have stemmed from my, frankly, lack of emotional maturity. I can rush, make mistakes, put the blame on others, and never make anything seem like it is my fault.

All of the above has frustrated my partner to no end. So a couple of weeks ago, BF and I basically had a 'come-to-Jesus talk' about how when our lease is up, we are going to have to make a decision about our relationship and whether or not we stay together or go our separate ways. Obviously this devastated me, as this is the guy that I envision spending my life with. I know he wants us to work out, but obviously has to think of himself first.

I want to mature/act my age, so I've read several (20+ articles) on how to become emotionally mature, as well as buying (and having read 1 of the 2) books on ways to become Emotionally Mature and strategies on how to improve. For the first week, I was doing well, and then last night I made some mistakes that caused me to break a glass, and just make excuses for myself. This greatly frustrated my BF and we had a small argument this morning.

I don't know why I seem to only be able to 'change' for a week and then revert back to my old ways and obviously, I want to change for myself because I need to start acting my age.

Does anybody have any advice on how I can hunker down and CHANGE and be able to make the effort so I can save myself, as well as my relationship? It seems that making the effort is the hardest part for me.

Any advice is GREATLY appreciated, and please be as harsh as you want. I don't want to take the easy way out

\-----

**TL;DR: bf and I have had arguments about my lack of emotional maturity and have decided that come our lease ending in Oct 2019, we need to decide where our relationship is heading. I need help on how to, frankly, sack the heck up, and not be lazy and make efforts.**",2019-07-08 13:55:43,9,1,relationship_advice
278,calayz,_lexxxi_98,Is he actually bored or actually done with me?,"So I can't vent to anyone I actually know, because well they wouldn't take it too well. Anyways I'm a 20f and my boyfriend is 36m and we have been together 2 1/2 years. We broke up for a couple months but got back together and now live together. Anyways, just last night I found out he was on a dating app again. My heart felt like it shattered into a million pieces. I walked into another and even said aloud ""this feels like a nightmare."" We ended up talking about it and he said there's absolutely nothing wrong with our relationship or with me. He's loves everything going on. This is our both first ltr that has lasted. He said he's just bored. Said he wants to know he still has it going on. I mean he's an attractive guy. His body count is well into the hundreds and he gets checked out frequently. And he misses the flirting. I try to flirt and do all that cute stuff but he always thinks I want something or have done something and most times ignores me. We have plenty of sex. There's normally not a time when I'm not jumping on him. He's normally the one pushing me away. I'm so lost right now. He doesn't fall in love easy or catch feelings so I'm not too scared that he'll find someone new, but if they catch him on the right day well they might just get him. I love him more than anything. I don't want to break up. He is the first person to actually believe in anything I do. He pushes me to be better, and has helped me become a better person.

279,calatp,jaelintherat,I [17F] have been in a relationship with my boyfriend [16] for less than a year and throughout our relationship his mental health has been getting messier :-(,"Hi, the past few months or so have been very tricky for my relationship as my boyfriend‚Äôs mental health is getting worse. He sees a good therapist but does not have the courage to tell him all the thoughts and depressing things he wants to do. He has said many times he wants to run away with me to be happy. His parents will not let him go on meds until he explains what exactly is wrong and the therapist his goes to has talked about it with his parents. He says he can‚Äôt explain it to anyone correctly as it‚Äôs a bunch of things such as my past relationships (As I‚Äôm his first girlfriend and before him I have had been in multiple relationships) and wishes he was my only relationship, his insecurities like his body and how he acts, how he thinks he‚Äôll never be happy again, etc. I also wanna add that he says I‚Äôm the only one who can explain things for him as I know him better. Whenever he feels down I have to pick him back up again and it‚Äôs hard just seeing him like this almost everyday.I can understand what he‚Äôs going through as I myself have mental health issues but I just want him to be happy :-( it breaks my heart when he says he shouldn‚Äôt be here or feels like I‚Äôm the only one who can understand him.  I care and love for him so much and don‚Äôt want to breakup with him.

Edit: I would also like to add my boyfriend has many, many regrets not asking me out sooner. He fell in love me over a year ago while I was in another relationship and wishes he told his feelings towards me along time ago.

281,cala9e,izmekitten,"It took one plane for him to abandon me, i dont know what to do","My boyfriend (27M) and I (23F) were together for 3 years. We were incredibly close and i supported him through everything. I loved him and i knew he loved me just as much, his actions always proved it and you can feel it when someone truly loves you. 

He was struggling financially here, our country's economy isn't great. So he decided to move back to his home country to build a future there. His plan was to marry me within a few months so i can join him because we both didnt want to be seperated and knew we were right for each other. He was going to marry me before leaving but i told him my parents wont allow it till he gets a decent job there. And so he left, we made a million promises to each other before he did and tried to make sure we can make it work with proper communication and effort.

But as soon as he got on that plane, he started to ignore me all the time, barely put any effort to talk to me. I was crying everyday and id show him how upset i am. I really missed him and he was abandoning me. His response was to constantly tell me im negative, ignore me even more, and just tell me hes stressed there and alone. He was an asshole to me all the time. Fast forward 2 months and i check his email only to find that be went on a dating app, payed for the premium, watched cam girls, and tried to pay a prostitute from the dating app to hook up with him but she just hacked all his money. I had a panick attack. I broke up with him after that and tried to ignore him but he kept saying he sidnt cheat and begging for me. He wouldnt stop texting me and crying for days about how he loves me until i finally gave him a chance to explain himself but it was useless cause she just came up with excuses that dont make sense. Its been on and off ever since, everytime i try to forgive him he goes back to ignoring me and blaming me and everytime i break up with him he just cries and begs for me. 

Im heartbroken and cant believe whats happening. I dont even recognize who he is anymore and i refuse to believe he didnt love me because it was so obvious he did and like i said he was going to matty me before leaving. Can someone truly change just because of distance? Everyone is telling me i should let him go because hes treating me like garbage but i love him tremendously and i dont know why this is happening. Its making me very suicidal because the years i spent with him were the happiest of my life. I cant ever get them back and i feel like the person i knew died on that plane.",2019-07-08 13:51:30,3,1,relationship_advice
282,cala30,iplayedbasketball,I [20M] believe I‚Äôm failing in love with one of my best friends [19F],"Hey reddit, this is a throwaway acct. but i‚Äôm a longtime lurker of this sub on my main. Anyway, let‚Äôs begin this story.

I just started at a new college this past January, and one of the first people I met was this girl down the hall, she was extremely beautiful and kind, proceeded to give me her snapchat, told me to come chill whenever, and basically just lent a hand to someone she knew needed it. Over the course of about 4 months of constant hanging out, I really began to appreciate her and all her qualities, her sense of humor, the way she lights up a room with energy when she talks about her passions, but not to the point of full on ‚Äúcrush‚Äù development. She then told me that she would not be returning to our college next semester, and this crushed me. I threw her a little get together with food and friends and got her a present she‚Äôs been wanting for a while (tarot cards) and a hand-written letter of how much I appreciate her and what she means to me (once again, not a fully developed crush yet so i did not tell her I liked her in this letter.) The letter was a hit and she was very grateful and told me ‚ÄúI love u so much, ur one of the most amazing human beings, i appreciate everything u do for me‚Äù and I replied with ‚Äúyou deserve it all, never forget that‚Äù which she reacted to with a heart. We all said our goodbyes when she left, and i cried shortly after.

I‚Äôve visited her (she lives 3 hours away) about 3 times. The first 2 times, our entire friend group was hanging out and it was good times all around, This most recent third time, however, it was a lot of just me and her. We went to a neighbors party and a lot of people there, including her relatives, asked me why am I not dating her yet? to which I didn‚Äôt know how to respond.   It definitely awoke something in me though, because I would catch myself getting lost in her warm, brown eyes and just feeling nothing short of utter bliss in her company. Fast forward to yesterday, me and unnamed girl are walking to convenience store with her 12 year old cousin, and the cousin asks her why we‚Äôre not dating, we both laugh, and she replies with ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like my best friend‚Äù which i didn‚Äôt take too badly bc this girl has told me in the past that she prefers dating people she had as friends first (it checks out.)

Anyway, a day after that all occurs, I leave her house, say my goodbyes, get home, and just start crying. It caught me so off guard that i‚Äôve become so attached to this persons‚Äô company and presence so much that it now hurts when i‚Äôm not with them. I told a mutual friend of ours how I feel about her, and she didn‚Äôt really have any solid advice for me, so I thought I would consult Reddit, sorry if i‚Äôm breaking any rules of formatting or whatever, but I just wanted to get this off my chest, what do you think I should do?",2019-07-08 13:51:09,3,1,relationship_advice

I'm working a job during my pre college break and it was fine until about a month ago. This colleague joined end May and we got along well. He's very extroverted and confident, and a good conversationalist. When he first joined, he was super touchy, but it wasn't in like anywhere taboo. He'd just always have his hands on my shoulder when he was walking past, asking questions etc etc. After about a week of working together, he asked me out to dinner, and I accepted, but was unsure if it was a Date. We went to town, and he asked me about my dating experience over dinner (ex bfs, worst dates etc) (I have no dating experience, lol) and he talked about his own experience. Afterwards, he paid for dinner and told me it was fine when I offered to pay my share. We walked around town, and when we were on the way back, he offered to walk me to my transfer station. It was pretty crowded, and he put his hand on my waist. At this point I was thinking that this was Not Platonic, and that feeling only got stronger when he asked for my number before he saw me off. I gave it to him because I didn't know how to reject him, and because I thought he was a funny guy.

Over the next two weeks, he texted me regularly, and I got the feeling that he was interested. He would ask me out for lunch or to hang out, and he would always comment things like ""cute"" or make suggestive comments/ask for my selfies. We went out a few more times after, and once to the movies where he gave me his jacket (and told me that he liked how I looked in it). I'm unsure if this is too fast for a relationship because I've never done this, but it seemed to be going smoothly.

Since two weeks ago, he has been texting me less reguarly and we also interact less at work. We work at neighboring departments, so I see him a lot. We would still talk and he would still be really nice, albeit flirty, but we weren't talking as much. I began to feel like maybe I was expecting too much, so I began to limit my interaction. I assumed that he was no longer interested, but he recently texted me again, and asked after me when he saw that I was having issues. I was touched by this, because I didn't expect that he would notice or much less, ask after me. However, he still hasn't talked much to me even after this, and I'm unsure if I should ask him what we have between us, or just drop it altogether because he seems like a player. I'm happy to provide more info, because this post seems to be a getting a little long.",2019-07-08 13:48:41,3,1,relationship_advice
285,cal8mx,hardcorewonderer,In desperate need of advice. Letting a very good man go because of daydreams and glorification of the past? What is wrong with me,"Dear readers. I am in desperate need for advice from all of you. My brain is in a chaotic state, and im not able to think straight. This will be a long post, but i hope some of you can take som time and read it, and maybe share your opinion. Am i a social media narcissist? Ungrateful? Do i have the grass-is-greener-syndrome? Read my story below.

I am a woman. 30 years old. I have been a restless soul since my early 20‚Äôs. Been traveling a little, had an ok job, lived with my parents to save money to be free enough to do almost whatever i‚Äôve wanted. I‚Äôve had a couple of relationships in between, but they ended because of cheating. (I was not the cheater).
I have always had big dreams, some of them realistic ones, som of them not so much. One of them have been moving to the United States, but since the circumstances havent allowed me to do so i have had to settle with traveling over there a few times.
(I am swedish, born and raised here in Sweden).
Not to sound full of myself, but i had alot of friends that adores me. And alot of people that i didnt know that adored me aswell. I had a strong presence on social media, and got alot of likes and comments on things i posted there. Everything from my travels, to my gym sessions, to funny videos i made and posted.
Its allmost like that was my high; the likes and admiring online. People have told me i am a woman of few, as im in a very man dominated job, and i look very good (their words, actually i have and still do to some extent; suffer from bodydismorphia. I think i look ugly sometimesF to the point where i dont want to leave the house). I have some tough hobbies, motorcycles, cars etc. I am kind and humble, and have been there for everyone that needed someone to talk to. Their secrets stays with me. 

I was single for about 4 years before i met my now boyfriend of one year. And let me start by saying he is the most amazing man a woman could ask for. He is so kind, so loyal, so patient, so humble. No secrets from me. He loves me unconditionally, and he make sure to let me know every day. Even on days im grumpy and not so nice to him, he gives me space and loves me anyways. And a bonus is his incredibly good looks. He tells me how beautiful i am, and talks about our future alot. 
Exactly this, is what i was on a hunt for when i was single. A partner like the one i‚Äôve finally found. 
I was often depressed when i was alone. My emotions was very high and low. When i had my ups, i was VERY happy and enjoyed life so much.  But sometimes the low‚Äôs was almost unbearable. (I had more ups than downs).

However, now that i have what i always wanted; a good man, a nice house out on the country, stabile jobs with alot of freetime and a darn good paycheck (wich btw is thanks to my boyfriend that got me into this job) i am starting to miss my life as single. I miss being free. I miss posting stuff online and get likes, comments and messages. I miss all the attention! I miss going on vacation and all the attention i got from men. I feel like a complete asshole for saying this, as it shouldnt matter when i have the amazing bf i have now. 
So i wonder what is wrong with me? 
Why do i miss something that isnt even real?
I miss a time where i was very often depressed.. but i seem to glorify it in my head for some reason, and i cant seem to shake it :-( 
I am scared i will ruin my relationship and chase after something thats not real. I know for sure that if i broke up i would miss him terribly after a few months, and would probably get depressed over doing such a bad decision of leaving such a great guy. 

So to sum it up, in my head, i would be willing to leave this stabile, safe, and good life; to be more on instagram and post videos and pics to harvest likes from people i dont even know.
To get attention from men that probably gives the same attention to a houndred other women and so on. 
I miss being admired of all, even tho i have a boyfriend that admires me for everything i do. I feel so bad for him.

Im torn and dont know what to do. Im 30 now, and still want to live as if i were 20. 

Anybody in a similar situation that can share some advice?",2019-07-08 13:47:33,20,1,relationship_advice
286,cal8ll,2019after2018,He never posts any pics of me and never mentions me on social media,"I am 48 and BF is 56. We have been together for around 2.5 yrs. He is very active on social media and posts a lot of pics with friends, family and coworkers. His relationship status was single until this year after constant requests from me to change it. He never posts any pics of me on social media or mentions when he is out with me. He has a few of his exes that are constantly liking everything he post. But the main ex i feel he post a lot of indirect messages to her in the form of quotes of how hurt he is that she broke up with him 3 years ago. When I ask him why he never posts anything about me or few places we go out to and he always dances around the question and comes up with an excuse. My gut feeling says he is protecting his ex feelings by not posting any pics with me and that he still is not over the fact that she broke up with him. I feel that I am too old to be dealing with nonsense like this. I am divorced after a 20 year marriage. I feel that the red flags are being waved in my face and I am completely ignoring them and will eventually get burned in the end. I hate that I keep ignoring my gut feeling. What are your opinions. I am not asking him to post constant pics of me or everything we are doing but I find it very strange that there is no mention of us anywhere on his social media. And he even posts about when he has a doctor‚Äôs appointment. I had been out of the dating game for so many years and this is what I come back to. SMH",2019-07-08 13:47:28,8,1,relationship_advice

(He had also been ‚Äúavoiding‚Äù me for 2 weeks after winter break and I was very confused what was going on because 1.he wouldn‚Äôt text me for a couple days and then we would hookup and then like a week passed and he wouldn‚Äôt text me. And 2 we had made a bunch of plans over winter break for what we would do when we got back.) so He actually agreed that we should stop hooking up because he really likes someone and needs to figure it all out. I was pretty upset since I had started to really like him and I was really confused because we had made so many plans that we were both excited for, he then a couple weeks later he said that he missed me and wanted to start hooking up again. I agreed because I liked him and wanted to see if we could work out somehow. We then continued to hookup and hangout from my perspective like non-stop, like there was no break in it for a couple months. I come to find out later that he had been in a relationship since the middle of the first semester of my sophomore year. I find this out because he was distraught over the breakup - and being the good friend I am I put aside my problems and questions and was there for him through the breakup, trying to help in anyway I could. He says that there was never any overlap, but I don‚Äôt believe it because he had been dating her since October and I felt like we never had a break in our hooking up until we came back from winter break. So the whole last 2 months of the second semester I was sleeping over and hooking up but also trying to help him through the breakup, because honestly the girl was a psycho and did some fucked up shit. We got really close because of this and for 2 weeks I was home and I was still calling and helping him through the breakup and we were getting excited about having a good fun summer together and actually agreed that we wanted to only hookup with each other - then I moved in to our college town June 1st and he actually moved in to a friends house not even a block away. We hung out like A BUNCH and he slept over at my house every night he was in town and hung out with my friends and everything. I was really really happy because I was falling for him and it felt like he liked me too. We were basically dating without the title I felt like. We had 2 weeks that we both were out of town (he moved out of the friends house cause he was only allowed to stay there for a month and moved back home (1hour away) )and then when we both got back it felt like something was off. I did a huge favor for him because he was in a bad situation because his old roommate put a bunch of his shit he left on the street so I picked it up and stored it at my house for him. Then this past weekend we hung out for a bunch of it and it was really good but then on Sunday like 2 hours before he was going back home for the week, I got really upset because he was texting a girl while he was laying in my bed next to me. I didn‚Äôt say anything but I was visibly upset, we packed his car with all the stuff I stored for him and then he left. I texted him saying that I was sorry I got upset and that I don‚Äôt get why I‚Äôm not enough for him. We went back and forth a bit but he eventually told me that ‚Äúwe do everything he could ever want and he‚Äôs mad at himself that he doesn‚Äôt see me that way‚Äù I was pretty heartbroken at this because I am in love with him and he is everything I could ever want in a person and more. I asked him if he ever tried to see me like that and he said he hasn‚Äôt. So I don‚Äôt get how he can say he doesn‚Äôt see me that way if he never ever tried, especially if he says that we do everything he could ever want- like we were literally a relationship without the title and my friends asked me when we were gonna date. I guess I just needed to get all that out cause I‚Äôm still really distraught over it all and really want to see him but I know I‚Äôm going to just be hurt more, but he‚Äôs my best friend and I really miss him and it has only been a day... and I feel like we could totally be so great in a relationship I just don‚Äôt get how he says he doesn‚Äôt see it. I wish we could just start over and go on a real date and see what it feels like but idk‚Äî- anything anyone has to say helps

289,cal72v,vondissen,In need of immediate repair - I fell in love and I think I blew it by coming on too strong. How do i fix this?,"This is embarrassing because I've been around long enough to know better, but I got caught up in the excitement.  

&amp;#x200B;

Context: 

I'm 33 male and about a year out of dating after getting roasted by the ex i thought i was going to marry.  I've had a bunch of dates since then but nobody has sparked any legitimate interest for me.  The person i met is 27 F and about 2 months out of a 1 1/2 year relationship that did not go well at all - he was verbally abusive, cheated and now she has trust issues.   We're both well-educated and conventionally good looking.  I'm somewhat attractive whereas she could melt the glaciers just by getting too close - she is probably the most amazing thing I have ever seen.  However, her looks only brought me close.  She is intelligent and caring, out of the party scene and focuses on health and self-betterment.  

&amp;#x200B;

The event:

I live in a nice apartment downtown and I met her at my pool on the 26th through a mutual friend.  We hit it off immediately and had a group dinner at my place on the 30th, but kept it casual.  She's new to town and doesn't really know anyone so I invited her over for the 4th as my building was hosting a rooftop pool party with DJ and catered food etc - it was supposed (and was) a really nice time.   She shows up, mingles with my friends and we have a couple drinks (but not enough to be drunk).  After a few hours we kiss and literally see fireworks.  Everything feels incredible like it was out of a movie.  I had all my friends around but I only saw her.  We'd go on to be affectionate 20 more times before we called it a night around midnight.  There was no sex or attempt at sex as i didn't want to rush it or make it seem like that was my intention or motive.  

As we're on the couch before she leaves we're able to sit and stare comfortably and both are saying how wild it felt that we've only just met but the feelings are so strong.  She admits she's a little scared by it because she wasn't expecting to be into someone so fast after her last relationship.  I tell her all kinds of shit I wish I didn't say because I was so excited by the idea of her and basically I come on super strong, but it seemed reciprocated so I didn't think i had made a fatal flaw yet.   Then she leaves.  We say goodnight.  We make tentative plans to hangout over the long weekend and for me to show her the city.

&amp;#x200B;

The chaos:

And here is where everything went wrong.  I didn't get the opportunity to see her the next day so I went out with a few friends and drank way more than I should have and I made the classic mistake of texting after drinking.  I wayyyy overtexted this poor girl saying how pretty i thought she was and how into her I was.  I even thought i was smooth by saying I thought she was ""magic.""  To be honest, I still feel that she is or I wouldn't be here looking for help now.  Anyway, the next day she responds about 12 hours later and says something like ""haha its okay.""  But it wasn't okay.  Texts are infrequent and I feel she thinks i'm a crazy person.  I'm in fear to even text to again to further validate that claim.  

The final convo went something like this  (Saturday night):

Her:  Hey have you been to ""X"" it's a great spot. \[730pm\]

Me: Yeah! it's cool place with good cocktails - are people in that little pool?

Her: Yes lol, the best frozen rose i've had.

Me: I know a better one!  We can go tonight or another time if you're busy.  

Me: (double text. ugh) I'm free at 9 if you want to meet up.  \[745pm\]

Her: Not busy! just need to go home and shower. \[750pm\]

Me: Okay! no rush.  Shoot me a text when you're ready and i'll figure out where to meet up.

Me: Whats your status \[945pm\]

\-----

\----

\---

Her:  Sorry! i thought i text you last night to say I stayed at the bar (place she mentioned in first text) till 130. \[4pm the next day\]

&amp;#x200B;

The now:

I didnt respond to that text.  It's 9am Monday morning and I spent all day Sunday overthinking everything.  It seems pretty obvious she doesn't want to talk and only messaged me yesterday to be ""nice.""  I came on too strong and HOPEFULLY didn't blow it, but I probably have so I can't really blame her.  There was more than a spark and legitimate interest on her part before I sabotaged myself in text form.   I don't want to dig my grave any further but i also will continue to dwell over it until something else transpires.  I want to text and say something - anything, but i was hoping the  experts of Reddit could help me in my hour of need.  

Two text ideas i've mulled over:

&amp;#x200B;

1) ""Hey, it's pretty obvious I pushed you away a little bit with my overzealous texting and I apologize for that (again). I'd be pumped if you'd meet me for a drink tonight to give me a chance to not blow it using text.  If not, I totally understand where you're coming from and ill leave you alone.""

2) ""Any chance we could meet up after work tonight?  None of our weekend plans worked out and my text-game has been atrocious to say the least.""

&amp;#x200B;

Id also like everyone to know, I'll be super bummed to lose this one cause i tried too hard, but i want to be clear if she says i creeped her out or she's not into me, i'll respect that and leave her alone.  

&amp;#x200B;

Please tell me what you would do and how you would handle it.  (If saying nothing is your advice, which it very well might be the best thing i appreciate it, but if nothing else is said i'll never stop thinking about it)

&amp;#x200B;

290,cal613,finnguy96,( M23) How to suggest threesome to my bisexual gf?,"Hi, me and my girlfriend have been together fo 4 years now, and this odea has been in my head since she told me she was bisexual but i have never had the courage to ask her/tell her about my fantasy because I am scared she wouldn't take it well. She has never had any sexual intercourse with women (that i know of), so I think it could be good for her to try it and maybe explore that part of her sexuality? Otherwise our sex life is good and the relationship is just great.

Im scared she will feel like she is not enough or that I just want to have sex with another girl, even if it's not that simple. I just want to see  her with another woman I guess.

So what do you think? Do any of you have any experience with this kind of situation? How do I start the conversation and ask about this without possibly hurting her feelings?",2019-07-08 13:41:07,8,0,relationship_advice
291,cal52t,ninzbs,A guy (20M) I (19F) was ‚Äúseeing‚Äù randomly stopped texting me as much. What could be the reason?,"I met this guy back in April at a party in college. This was 2 weeks after I had gotten out of a 2 year relationship. He had also gotten out of a 2.5 year relationship back in January. We really hit it off the night we met and we ended up hooking up. After that one night he kept asking me to hang out 1 or 2 times a week and we would have sex as well as do date type things. We never talked about what the relationship was, but we both said that we need to wait a few months before either of or can consider anything serious. 

Then, summer came. He lives in CT and I live in NY so we aren‚Äôt that close to each other. He studied abroad for 2 weeks in Australia right after the semester ended and he ended up texting me everyday. I thought he may have been really interested at this point bc why would he make the effort to message me everyday if he wasn‚Äôt interested? especially while in a different country. When he got back he visited me for 2 days. Then he went home and continued to text me everyday. Then I visited him about 3 weeks later. All of this went well I thought, but he started texting me less right after I visited him. He has probably texted me like 3 times since the end of June. I can‚Äôt help but kind of feel offended and sad. I don‚Äôt think I did anything wrong so idk what the problem is. 

Things I should mention is we aren‚Äôt exclusive. He tells me when he hooks up with other people. He did mention a girl he was talking to before I visited but he said that she was being too overbearing with emphasizing how similar they were. Also, he has already told me multiple times that he still plans on hooking up with me Fall semester, as I have a single room on campus and he says that he‚Äôll ‚Äúbe sleeping over a lot.‚Äù However, he tells me that he wants to ‚Äúmaster his game‚Äù and sleep with a lot of women before he settles down again, which I find odd because he doesn‚Äôt seem to be a douche bag. Also, he doesn‚Äôt use tinder and he‚Äôs in a new town so he doesn‚Äôt know anyone and he doesn‚Äôt really have new people to meet because there is no where for him to really meet people. Also, at the end of the semester he was like ‚Äúwhat if I take you out on a date over the summer?‚Äù.  Seems so contradictory and confusing. Another weird thing is when I visited it came up that I told my friends I was going and he was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not hid from your friends‚Äù. 

Now I don‚Äôt know what to do. I keep snapchatting him to try to engage him again but he will either open it and not answer or he will comment on what I sent a few times and then eventually not answer. I think it‚Äôs been about 2 weeks since he actually texted me. I guess I grew more attached than I thought I was but I am actually kind of getting upset about this.

292,cal3zt,Throwawayafteruse08,Feel like I'm (23/m) bothering girlfriend (23) with my feelings,"On mobile, sorry if there are any mistakes. 


We have been together for about 5 years, lived together for almost 4. I'm generally an easy going guy, I don't rarely get upset, and if I do I'm able to work it out by myself. We have barely had any arguments, never had any major arguments. I adhere to my dad's advice of ""happy wife = happy life"" and am willing to compromise on everything. 

However,  my girlfriend is quite the opposite. She is very emotional but I have always been there for her to support her and help her through her problems. Sometimes sitting up with her for hours at night whenever she is sad about something. She has even gone to see a therapist for additional help. She has never had to do the same for me until about a month ago. I was feeling really stressed about starting a new job and a few days after work I wouldn't be in the best mood - feeling that I'm not doing good enough at work (only one new there trying to learn) and just other small things, not sleeping well etc. It was just starting to bottle up. So naturally, I was telling her about all this. Her reply was ""stop being so negative when you come home, it's ruining my positive mood"" (paraphrasing).

Since then, I've only been feeling worse to the point where I would say overall, I'm unhappy. But I don't feel comfortable bringing this up anymore as I feel it'll just cause issues.

I don't know what I'm expecting to get from here, but I'm sorta at a loss with it all.",2019-07-08 13:35:56,6,1,relationship_advice

2. They have a girlfriend 
3. Respect me enough to know that us being romantic/sexual would ruin the friendship.

Somehow i see a lot of similarities in the story(thats definitely not hers, just another view on close situation). So i need some advice. Sorry very long post.

 I was in relationship with a girl for 6 years(we started dating in our 16-17 at school). We moved to another city's university together. Sometimes we had problems, even 1.5 month break once. Both had never cheated, no other people involved. Most of our problems were about one of us done stupid thing not really associated with other one. ( You know just like throwing the uni or  taking shitty credit problems). Also to my shame i lied a lot. About not crucial thing mostly, just little things. From not little things - watching porn in secret, despite she didn't like it(we didn't have sex  those years, just petting). I know it is not about porn but about lie, i was stupid, i know.

 Almost 2 years ago we decided to end this, but just be close friends. I propose this but she wanted to try again(now i think i was stupid, but that is not important here i guess). We agreed that if any of us had someone he/she should immediately tell. It was really good for couple of months, we were comfortable with each other, it was cool. I somehow began thinking about relationship again. Then was really confusing situation. We are living in same dormitory, so we often just hang out together. It was another planned evening with wine. I was texted by my ex ex gf(we were dating when i was 14, just holding hands). She is living in about 15000km from me. It was about the job(im home teacher and she had a student for me, her mother is also a home teacher, we last met 5years from that time). This pissed of my gf, despite showing the messages, evening was cancelled. I thought i did nothing wrong, so I just forgot about it. That was the end of November.

 From this point every time i was trying to spend time with her she was ""busy"". I tried to spent new year with her, but no. After NY i texted her, i said "" i really miss you, mb we can go for a walk right now or you can come to my house(in my hometown we are living in 10 minutes). She answered something like ""no thanks, it is raining, i think you are ok without me""with lots of emojis, being really nice. I was really angry at her, but said nothing bad. Next time we met was 13 of January in dormitory. She was REALLY nice to me, i dont know. I liked it. 18 of January she told me that there is a guy(26M now) she likes, and tomorrow gonna be their first date. Soon i figured out that they were chatting for nearly a month, but nothing serious. I understood why she was felling guilty but i was fine with it. We just continue to be close friends. Soon she had no time for me. She refused to celebrate a bit the semester ending and my birthday because HE thinks that it is inappropriate. I remind that our relationship were really platonic for 6 months. I was really angry about it, i didn't say anything about her, but made it clear that im pissed. Then was really long story about me figured out her being with him at night before my BD, she came back only at noon just to give the present. I was super pissed of, said something like i dont want the present (it was nothing important btw), cause she doesnt have time for me.(im really making this short). 

 After that we just stopped any relationship. Only hi.(i remind we live in the same dormitory). I was really depressed, almost fatally. She didn't care, refusing to talk to me. I was trying to rebuild friendship somehow, it was impossible. But i was making my way. 

 A week ago i just messaged her something like this "" hey, we really didn't chat for a lot, lets have a tea together, i want to know how your life is going."" She answered ok, and we had our time. It was really good for both (she was sceptical, said she had only an hour, but we had 4 hours talk). She is still with that guy, but not living with him. She is not initiative with messages, so I guess now she thinks about me not like a friend, but mb a man to have a fun talk several times a year. I want much more. I think it is like kinda REAL family, no matter what they do, you still want to be with them. We were really close. I have such thoughts only for her.  

 I must say that i dont have any emotional attachment to anyone except her. Even my parents (our relationships are ok, but kindof businesslike). I loved her. Don't know about now, but i am really thinking a lot about her these two years. She is very nice person. It was two years ago, but it still hurts a lot. I nearly fucked up my last year in uni(i got only excellent marks before, now mediocre). I never had someone these years.(not even holding hands or fluff talk) I just dont like other girls, only their bodies, but that is normal i guess. I don't really have good friends, so it is first time someone will learn about my story.

 I don't know what to do now. Usual advice ""give up and move on"" doesn't help. I'm doing it long enough, but just can't. Mb i should not be so persistent with her. So the question is not only what should i do, but also how to deal with the decision. 
P.S. English is not my native language, sorry for grammar.

TL;DR I still wanna be close friend to my 2years ex gf and i dont know if i have the right.",2019-07-08 13:26:27,2,1,relationship_advice
305,cakzyz,mar_btw,I think I fucked up,"I‚Äôve known this guy since 2013, when I was 12 years old. I am 18 in a couple of days now so i‚Äôve known him for 6 years but we had kind of a friend break from 2015-2018 because he got a girlfriend where we just spoke a little to keep contact. This was all over the internet. I got to know him on a game. 

Our friendship was very sexual, I was 12-13 and extremely curious so it was exchange of pictures, he maaturbated on cam and just sexting. This was dumb and I know and i regret but I didn‚Äôt know any better. He is one year older. But at the same time I was being ‚Äúused‚Äù without knowing because I thought having contact with a guy much older was cool, and also did this with a guy who was then over 20. Which I have no contact with now.. 

I‚Äôve always had extremely bad confident. And therefor attention makes me do things i shouldn‚Äôt, and also since i‚Äôm kind and thinks good of people i guess this makes me easily manipulated. 

Now i‚Äôve gotten in contact with this guy again, the one that is one year older than me. Our contact had always been sexual so it was easy to go back to, but I know better than to send pictures and videos now so only thing we did once was barely sexting. Which i obviously regret. 

Now he ordered tickets to come here because he was joking about it and then ended up actually doing so which makes me panic. For multiple reasons. He wants to take my virginity, I‚Äôm not interested in him like that any longer and I don‚Äôt want to just have sex with him and then he leaves. He comes on my 18th birthday and I really don‚Äôt want that day ruined.

I even said my week is fully booked since i‚Äôm busy moving and he does not seem to care. I‚Äôve told my friends to not tell him where I live or where the party is so that he can‚Äôt come. But i‚Äôm afraid he will find out. I also don‚Äôt want to make him mad since i‚Äôm afraid he has the photos i sent years ago, since he said he kept them but deleted them when we stopped talking.

But he is so pushing. And is set on coming here. He is already close enough now. I‚Äôm not scared of him i just don‚Äôt want to meet him now, for multiple reasons. I have extremely bad confident and i‚Äôm afraid he will not like me, i don‚Äôt want to have sex with him and i also am not attracted to him. 

I‚Äôm a little down because I wonder if i‚Äôm very easily manipulated. It‚Äôs as if it smells off me because every guy i talk to only wants something sexual etc. 

This guy helped us moving and had my number, asked to add me on snapchat so I could play ps4 with him and I didn‚Äôt think anything bad about it. And now he is messaging me all the time asking for pictures, asking for sex and he has a girlfriend?? 

It honestly makes me really sad because all I want is a meaningful relationship. I mean, it‚Äôs my fault but i‚Äôm so tired of it and i‚Äôm saying no, but it‚Äôs as if they don‚Äôt understand.

what is wrong with me honestly?",2019-07-08 13:25:37,3,2,relationship_advice
306,cakzru,sarnad31,F2M Trans Hubby Stopped Taking Testosterone and Now Wants Divorce. Help?!,"This is long....

My FTM husband wants to leave me. After 4 years. He wanted to leave me 3 mths ago cause we had a fight over me having anxiety, getting angry sometimes and being too scared/procrastinating getting help for it despite him encouraging me constantly to go get help (i was later diagnosed with complex PTSD). I tried to save my marriage after that fight by finally getting mental help. The day I went to get help, he was willing to try again and see if I really change. The past 3 mths have been adventurous and loving. Sleeping under the stars, kissing my shoulders EVERY morning to wake me up, cuddles, etc. We hadnt had a fight in months, which is huge. The other day we had a dispute that pertained to him saying he doesnt have remorse/regrets towards anything he has done or said. Even in regards to wanting divorce before. I got upset, and every time i questioned something, he kept saying painful things that were conflicting things he said/did before...that worried me..and I kept asking about it past his bedtime. The next day he wrote down 4 questions in a book for me to answer. 

 1: Why are we in a relationship if there will never be trust between us?

2: If you want me to tell you what I want, why don't you listen to the answer?

3: We prolong the inevitable outcome trying to patch up our relationship. I thought you didn't want that to happen? Not lead you on like I did my other relationships?

4: I'm sorry we rushed into marriage. I thought it would help your anxieties

 I was starting crying. He was calm and collected so he wasn't being a jerk at all. In fact, he was crying too.  He said that the past 3 months have been just 'okay'. Like, he enjoyed going to new places.. but he didn't feel fulfilled, because he felt like he couldn't trust me enough to open up to me about how he feels about things, cause I react so he hides it and feels unfulfilled as a result. And that he was trying to ignore how he felt and just tried to pretend? That he would rather do adventures alone. That he would be unhappy without me, but unhappier with me cause he doesn't want to deal with anyone's stress other than his own atm. That he doesn't 'want' this, he feels he 'needs' it. That he isn't himself. I said ""I thought we were doing great the past 3 months"". I spent a lot of money doing everything he loves. Him taking selfies everywhere with me, and I controlled my anxiety so much better. He would kiss me every morning so sweetly.. and he told me ""for you the adventures were great, but I was not happy, it was not enough. I felt something missing. I haven't been happy for a while"". 

 I told him that if I don't make him happy, then I'll accept his wishes. He started getting sad. And then he said... ""I want you to be happy too honey and you don't seem like you have been lately either""  I told him ""I dont understand..whenever you seemed upset I always asked what was wrong and you said it was work or something..and when I ask you if it was me,  you got mad that i didn't believe you were happy with me. You always complain I don't believe you cause I need reassurance ...and that it hurts your feelings. Why are you proving me right?"" And "" if you are so unhappy the past couple weeks, why did you want to surprise me with a tattoo wedding band?"" he said ""it was your idea""...wow. I mentioned it as a joke 1 YEAR ago. I accidently found out the secret that he was going to do it and he got upset that I spoiled the surprise. My 'idea' my ass. 
I asked him if he wanted a separation or a divorce. He said ""I  want a divorce because it would be harder to be just separated and it wouldn't allow me to fully let you go cause you'd still be...'here' in a way."" But then i asked if he wants it for 'now' or 'forever' and he said "" for now"" And then told me he loves me, reciprocated that we love each other more than anybody ever, cried, etc.

I asked him if he was just trying to soften the blow on me and he really wants to be without me forever.. and he shrugged, and said ""in the future, if you become more stable and happy ..then maybe we can talk about it"". And I said ""is that what you're hoping for?"". And he shook his head yes. And then I said ""..or do you just really want us to never see each other again"". His response was..""like i said, I don't know. I will have to be apart from you to have the answer to that""

I told him, I have nowhere to go right now (he uprooted me across country with his parents. I know no one here and haven't been in this state long enough to have a job yet) and I would like to try and get an apartment but I don't want it to be awkward living here. And he said ""that's fine, and we can all like go do things as a family together but just know that we're NOT going to do things as a couple. This would be so there's no animosity in the house. The end goal is divorce so just to make that clear"". 

And after we had this somber divorce agreement.. he went out to Home Depot. I was at the time wrapping up our wedding photos and putting them away. Crying.. because I couldn't stand walking past them anymore. His mother came halfway upstairs feeling really bad for me, telling me I am always welcomed and loved and can stay as long as I want. That minute, he came back into the house, his mom turned around and asked him ""what you got?"" He went (and this is no exaggeration) ""I got an awesome foam topper for when we go caaamping!! Oo and I also got this and this, and it will be soo fun! ^_^"". He then came upstairs to put the foam topper on the bed but noticed i was wrapping our wedding photos up on it and he said ""Oh, I can see you are busy hehe. I will put this in the other room. ;)""  . I was sick to my stomach with how jubilant he was. 

I went out to talk to my friend. When i came back in the house, everyone...him, his parents..were doing that "" how you doing sweety? Lets go to fireworks tonight!"". And then he was like ""Oh, hey hey look at this Sarah! Look at this awesome Geode! It really polished up nice :). Hey does hot dogs sound good for dinner?"". And then like, walking around laughing with his folks, BBQing. ""Hey mom! You want a hot dog with this salad? They are gluten freeeee""  and shit like that. 

  Why is he saying he needs a divorce 'for now', but not a seperation cause if there are still ties, he can't move on and have the opportunity to possibly miss me/want me back? While bawling. It doesn't make sense. Even when I asked him to make sure he wasn't fluffing my tail with bullshit, he straight up said we either will or won't, but he hopes I get myself straightened out and happy and then 'we' can continue from there. He keeps saying he cant talk to me about how he feels. Like, he doesnt trust me enough to open up to me for some reason, even if I ask..cause I guess I cant handle it? If he opened up about how he feels about his mom, or work, or anything.. I was always there for him. It was only when he had feelings about us that he was sad over that I would respond with ""why would you think that?"" instead of ""I understand""..therefore he lost trust in opening up(?) I feel like such shit for it. I feel like,  I used him for an emotional tampon and he felt cornered and burdened and wanted out when he couldn't deal anymore. I think anyone would leave that. 

So anyway, I then got some messages from his brother, who incidently found out about things and wanted to talk. A verbatim summary of what he said ( responses to my texts) was ..

"" I am sorry. It's not you. You're truly a warm and caring person. I'm sorry Ken cant reciprocate the emotional commitment a relationship should have. Communication and trust are really everything. You arent alone in having anxiety/depression. Unfortunately, you also aren't alone in Ken distancing himself whenever he was needed either. No, I don't think you were an emotional tampon. I'd buy that maybe if you were dating..but 2 things: 1) Your inner voice is your worst critic. 2) You aren't dating. YOU'RE MARRIED. He knew damn well going in how your anxiety was. And you aren't the first person he's dated with anxiety/depression...and you arent the first he has left cause of it either, you are like.. the fifth.  Vicky, Jen, Jess (ex spouse), Angie, and now you. He left ALL of them cause they needed emotional support. In every relationship I've seen with Ken, he's been great when the relationship is on rails and everyone is happy, but as time goes on and his partner becomes more ""needy"" (forgive the term), he distances himself and when the other partner continues to ask for support, he leaves. Ken doesn't like being leaned on. He enjoys the good, and then bails when it becomes more than superficial. Even if things magically get better now, he's just going to do the same thing whenever your relationship inconveniences him. That's not right. He manipulated you into his idea of a convenient relationship. Meek, and easy.  He's a sociopath. You gave up A LOT to be with him. Your home, friends, and vehicle when he suggested. Ken picks really great people, not going to lie...then he chews them and spits them out. He bails on everyone when things get complicated and inconvenient. Do you remember what I sat you down, and told you when you two first got together? About his history of breaking hearts? He doesn't want to fix partners, but he definitely prefers less confident partners. I don't know why. And he doesnt want to expend the energy needed. Can't tell you how he feels cause he knows how you will react? Thats bullshit, cause everything honest he says is..rather terrifying. I honestly in good faith do not think I could attend another wedding of his, if he has one. I really just want to be like "" dude, get a Tinder acct or swingers club. You need to tell people relationships with you dont end well"" lol. Just realize that I am here for you, Angie is too..and especially my parents. They really really like you and want you to stay, help you out, hang out. Screw Ken, HE can leave."" 

After he went on a solo camping trip for a day, I told him to have a good time and his response was a nice, but unenthusiastic ""yeah...we'll see I guess"". When he got back, I went into his car to grab my coat from the back and saw a open box of tampons in his camping bag.. with like...a quarter missing. Realize that he has been on Testosterone for 10 years. Without break. The reason he stopped taking it, was cause he started getting cramps without periods..and the trans community here, told him it was his uterus saying ""Hey! I'm still here"" and the solution would be to stop T till he had a period. So he stopped T about 1 month ago..Well, now I know he was having a period when we had the divorce talk and while he went camping. And this isn't like, normal PMS...he hasn't had a period in 10 years. I noticed the past few weeks he seemed really..off. Just off. I mentioned it to him weeks ago and he thought it was cause he stopped taking T, cause he said when he 'was' a woman, he was very mean to people, and that T mellowed that out..but when we had the divorce talk, and he was all emotionally telling me he wanted out, I mentioned the hormone thing and he went ""yeah, I mean we can see but it probably has nothing to do with my decision"". 

I am just wondering, if like, going off of T after being on it so long...coupled with PMS would make him make such rash decisions? If it seems like that is probably the culprit? Or does it just enhance the truth and I am in denial? 

He messaged me just a few ago saying ""rock collecting early tomorrow if interested"" btw...(ummm..wtf)",2019-07-08 13:25:09,7,0,relationship_advice

309,cakyiw,Throwmeawayimtrash89,I (28 F) feel like I am in a grey area of consent with my long term partner (31 M) and could use some advice.,"Hello all,

I have been with my partner now for 4.5 years. About a year in we experienced an event that left me with PTSD which brought on intense insomnia. After trying many different combos of pills and therapy I finally found that taking 20 mg of Paxil every night at bed was my golden ticket to restful sleep.


I have always been kind of an active sleeper, moving around a lot and talking sometimes. It all started out when I woke up one morning and my partner told me I rolled over and grabbed his penis in the middle of the night. He said it turned him on but when he went to engage me it was evident I was passed out and so he just rolled over and masturbated/fell back asleep. 


More and more frequently instances like that would occur, evolving further into me grabbing his face and kissing him, having full blown coherent conversations. I never remembered any of this when I woke up. 

Then I started waking up to us engaging in sexual acts. Vaginal and oral penatration. I would snap too and be heavy in the midst of the act, enjoying myself.  Partner swears I engaged or gave consent in some form every time but I do not remember. 


Then there came a time where we engaged in a sexual act that I did not come too during or remember that I did. My partner was talking about it the next day with me and I was just like, wait.. what? He swears I was cohereng and engaged, eyes open even. We both agreed at that point that me not recalling this stuff the next day put both of us in an uncomfortable situation that we did not want to be in and that after I take my sleeping pills that all bets are off for sexual activity for the rest of the night.


Seemed all and well, until one day he tells me we had sex the night before. I did not remember. He apologized for breaking the rule and that he had an entire coherent conversation before anything happened. I wasnt particularly upset but told him we really should try and stick too it no matter how aware we seem.


Last night I came too during a sexual act. I heard him pleading ""say or do anything that lets me know you want it"" i was moaning and groaning. We engaged and he finished and I went back out, snapped back a few minutes later pants down and I went to the bathroom.


He hasn't acknowledged it. I am wondering if I even should..


I am really confused. What can I do if I am giving unaware consent?? If I seem alert and awake? Has anyone ever experienced this before? I dont want to stop the medication it really, really works for me, but I do not want to feel so out of control of my own body..",2019-07-08 13:22:03,8,5,relationship_advice
310,cakybc,please_help_me_9586,Me [25F] and my bf [26M] of close to 2 years have had engagement pushed back multiple times. It's frustrating and I dont know how to approach this,"We have had a wonderful and fast two years. We started discussing marriage about 8 months into the relationship and I was so sure about him early on, I have never felt this way about anyway before. So naturally I was ready for the next step, we are both Christian and I view dating as a precursor to marriage. 

We first discussed and I wanted an engagement about 8 months ago. He said he wasnt ready for engagement and listed some things he wanted to work on. That was totally fine, it hurt a bit and was hard for me to wait but it was okay. I asked if it could be in 3 or 4 months later instead, so we could work on the things he listed. I later wanted to us to go ring shopping. He agreed to do so in Novemeber. 

Fast forward 3 months and he got the ring and said the issues he was worried about were okay now but said that he wanted to wait as he was going through a lot of hard relationship issues with his mom as she disliked me greatly (due to race issues, I am black and he is white) so it was hard for both of us to deal with this and especially him to have to basically sacrifice his relationship with his mom. I was hurt again but it was okay, I understood where he was coming from and wanted to support him.

I asked if we could be engaged in the next 3 months which would give time to work through his relationship issues with his mom and for him to plan engagement and tell his family. He agreed and he told his family he planned on proposing to me.

Fast forward 3 months and we had a big argument about it. He said he felt miserable and couldnt figure out how to be okay and happy with how his mom treated him and I. He said he wanted to start going to counseling to really work on himself so he will be ready for engagement. Of course, this hurt again and it was really tough for me to continue waiting. But I was glad he was making actually steps to work on himself this time. We discussed it again and agreed to engagement in 3 months. 

Now, it's been 3 months. We havent had a discussion about pushing it back yet, he says he is planning it soon. 

I have just had a really hard season with everything that has gone on. On one hand, I feel like I have been too pushy for engagement and have caused some of the pain I am feeling. On the other, I feel burned that he keeps pushing it back. I'm just worried it will never happen. 

He means the world to me and has loved and supported me more than any person in my life. He has sacrificed and committed more to me than I feel an engagement would represent, but I do want to be marriaged and start my life. What should I do?

TLDR: My bf has pushed back engagement a few times, with new reasons that I dont feel are illegitimate but it always feels like it will be something. He means so so much to me and I can't every imagine being with anyone else, but how can I approach this engagement issue when I am ready for marriage?",2019-07-08 13:21:28,3,1,relationship_advice
311,cakw7r,taupestonecottage,My friend hid her secret from me after finding out about mine,"Here‚Äôs some background... I am the mother of young children who regularly hangs out with a small group of other mothers of young children. I will be 30 at the end of the year. I am also pregnant with my third and due at the end of this month. 

Last summer, I had a miscarriage at 7 weeks. I told the ladies in this group and they were of course supportive. 

Several months later, I became pregnant with my current pregnancy. 

A couple of weeks after I found out I was pregnant with my current pregnancy, one of the women in this group, ‚ÄúAlicia,‚Äù asked me if I had gone to the ob/gyn lately. I was caught off guard completely (and I had actually been to the doctor the day before), so I gave a quick and vague answer. Alicia had figured out that I was pregnant long before I wanted to tell anyone.  I confirmed it with her a couple of weeks later. 

Long story short, I bumped into Alicia at the doctors office a few weeks ago and found out she was 14 weeks pregnant. I asked her if she had told the other girls in our circle and she said she had, during a gathering we were all at two weeks prior. She said she was trying to be discreet and didn‚Äôt want to have everyone at the gathering find out. 

Here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äî she had SEVERAL opportunities to tell me privately during those two weeks, and I truly believe that she told the other girls not to mention it around me.  I was pretty hurt and angry about the situation and didn‚Äôt know how to handle it.  Of course, at the moment I found out she was pregnant, I felt awkward and acted nice about it, but my hurt feelings didn‚Äôt start to fully register until after we talked. I also feel like she had snooped to find out about my current pregnancy, and after having lost my previous to a miscarriage too!  So I did the mature thing of continuing to hang out with the group but staying more guarded and distant around Alicia.  I hate confrontation and I always feel like an idiot when I confront my friends. My anxiety gets the best of me in those situations and my brain decides to shut down or disregard my feelings in place of appeasing the person who wronged me. 

Anyway, I now feel guilty for being distant from her, considering that she contacts me regularly and that we all still see each other. I just feel like it‚Äôs too late to confront her because then she‚Äôll know that I had been angry with her and had intended on acting distant from her for several weeks now.

My boyfriend and I have known each other for a year, official for about 9 months. 

A few weeks ago we were looking at holiday ideas on his phone on Instagram. A seemingly innocent message popped up which he opened. You could see previous messages from/to this person talking about how they couldn‚Äôt wait to meet up. I mentioned this calmly to my boyfriend who confirmed it was someone he‚Äôd messaged on Instagram before we were official (so within the first 4 months of us seeing each other), they‚Äôd never met, but were planning to, to sleep together. 

At first I wasn‚Äôt upset but after a few nights of thinking I realised I was maybe more affected than I thought. I‚Äôm comfortable ish with my figure, but like a lot of people there are aspects I wish were smaller and others that were bigger (172cm tall, weigh 140 pounds). I did go on the girl‚Äôs profile and she‚Äôs tiny, a lot of bikini photos too to confirm it. 

He did say it doesn‚Äôt matter what she looks like but we argued a little after I expressed my feelings and he got a little heated. He said a few things that did really including that it‚Äôs annoying that I‚Äôve made this an issue and hates that I want to be the best at giving him a blow job (sorry for TMI, seems irrelevant but isn‚Äôt below. I just want to give him the best time I can).

Now I feel so uncomfortable in my own skin, I don‚Äôt want to undress in front of him, I don‚Äôt sleep naked with him like I used to. We don‚Äôt have sex (used to be 3+ times a week now it‚Äôs less than once a fortnight), I‚Äôm always clothes if we have sex, the thought of a blow job makes me feel so embarrassed and I never initiate sex anymore. I just want to cry but I know this is my issue and I need to fix it. He roughly knows how I feel so doesn‚Äôt really try and initiate sex anymore either. 

Does anyone have any advice in what I should do/what we can do to move forward? I‚Äôd be grateful for any insight.

We've been together a few years, LDR, and recently have lived together for almost a year. We are good together, sex is amazing, and we are committed to each other, and see us spending our lives together. This summer I have got a job in a new country, and we agreed she is going to come over 6 months behind me, we have been saving for a deposit for a house, and she has already shipped all her things here with me.   


She has now asked for a break, for a 2-3 months, to reassess her life and her identity and prepare for the move internationally, she also wanted to open up the relationship, as she has never been with another guy, and it bothers her that I have had those experiences, and she has not. She says if she moves here to settle with me, she'd grow to resent me for not allowing her to experience something else.

After drilling a little deeper, I confirmed that it is actually mostly about this. We've always agreed an open relationship might be something, in the future, if we were in a strong place and communicated well about it. So it's not a surprise, but the timing of this feels weird. And of course, confirmed, it turns out there is just one guy she would trust enough and wants to sleep with, a work colleague, and they had a drunken kiss 2 months ago. Sounds really sketchy, and I told her I am not happy with it, but would agree to her sleeping with another guy, if it was *not him*, which was met with a lot of anger.    
She tells me she is committed to me, and to prove it she is going to *send me her life savings*, as a down payment on us. It's a lot of money, and all her stuff is here with me. I asked why not move here, and then we explore opening the relationship, but she just needs ""*to get this done*"", and then she will move to be with me.   


I still don't like the idea, even though I think I trust her intentions are right. There are just so many things that could go wrong, and I don't understand why she is willing to risk so much for one (or two?) nights with this guy?

Probably not too hard for him but I‚Äôm new to this and it hurt. So he told me you‚Äôre not a real submissive, you shouldn‚Äôt talk or move.

My question is I don‚Äôt understand the bdsm world as much. Is it normal that he spanked me so hard I almost cried? I get the feeling of power that a Dom gets but is it wrong for me to think that he‚Äôs also playing with my emotions? 

He says he doesn‚Äôt want to be with me but then he is with me and when I canceled our first date he got a bit upset and he said that‚Äôs fine I‚Äôve got another girl, hopefully I‚Äôll still want to see you tomorrow. Tiny bit hurtful?

325,cakonp,abcdefgcookie,I (24F) feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells with my fianc√© (36M). How do I explain this to him without causing him to be mad again?,"Obvious throwaway. So, I‚Äôve been with my fianc√© for 2 and a half years and our wedding is next year in August. However, lately I‚Äôve been feeling like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells with him and only started to notice I have to be careful with what I do or what I say. 

He‚Äôs a great guy - and he isn‚Äôt the worst person to be dating. He does have his quirks but so do I. We aren‚Äôt in a Dominant/Submissive relationship. Everything is pretty even. 

Now, when we first started dating it was little things like: I would say something he didn‚Äôt like/agree with or wore something he didn‚Äôt like or associated with someone he didn‚Äôt like. He would hold it in until blowing up at me and saying that I‚Äôve ‚Äúdisappointed him‚Äù in my behaviour towards XYZ or by wearing that dress. 

Recently I‚Äôve moved in with him - and it all started two weeks ago. My mom called and I was speaking to her in our native language while cooking dinner. After which him and I had a fine evening, and I cleaned up. It seemed fine until the next few days. He just ignored me unless he was telling me to do something or was asking me a question.  After that we went to visit my parents for the weekend, when we got home he treated me coldly for the entire week again. Even staying out with friends/coworkers at the bar late and coming home drunk. 

Then last night he snapped and said he‚Äôs annoyed that I never ask him what he wants for dinner/lunch. That I disappointed him by speaking about him in my native language (we weren‚Äôt) to my mother. 

I don‚Äôt want to upset him - but I don‚Äôt like that I have to be careful about what I do as to not have him be cold and then snap at me. How do I bring this up to him without annoying him and causing another week long cold treatment of ‚Äúno love‚Äù?

I do love him and when we‚Äôre good we are really good. We‚Äôll go on dates and the s** is good. And he is super respectful. We get along for the most part except when I irritate him in some way then he‚Äôs mean, even when he tells me what to do he‚Äôs mean. He‚Äôs also even worse when he‚Äôs drunk. 


So how do I bring this up without triggering him again?",2019-07-08 12:56:14,25,0,relationship_advice

I spent the day not doing much and decided to lighten the giant weight off my shoulders and drink a little just to ease the day.

327,cakogc,decidingtobebetter1,Having[mid-20s/m] issues thinking long term with SO [mid-30s/f)] - how can you genuinely know if you want to be with someone for the rest of your life?,"How can you genuinely know if you want to be with someone for the rest of your life?


I'm currently in my mid-20s dating someone in their mid-30s. This is my first long term relationship and we've been dating for a few years now, I've had many previous partners but all have been casual/short term ones and never delved into anything serious.

I feel like I've always had commitment issues and so any time the prospect of a long term relationship would begin I would shut it down. The one I'm currently in just sort of happened and I was more than okay with it - everything felt quite natural. We've been living together for over about a year with no major arguments.

Recently, I've been feeling a bit distant towards our relationship - I've been daydreaming of being alone (possibly even being with others) as I prefer to be alone and haven't had much/any time to myself, the move in together was natural, and convenient. I find myself not doing much from my day to day activities, wake up, get home, make dinner, watch tv for an hour, prepare tomorrows lunch, sleep. She is used to it but I feel like I should be more productive with my time and I feel having an SO in my life is stopping me from doing it as I have to focus on building a relationship with another person.

Her family/friends/acquaintances are getting engaged/married/having kids and while she has never pressured me into doing any of those, the thought of any of those scare me. It's something that should be discussed at our point in the relationship given that if we're not heading towards those, then what are we doing it for?

Relevant side story: I have a pet dog that I take care of, it was my first one as a family and I regret the family ever getting one. The responsibility of taking care of it fell onto me and while I'm doing the best I can to make sure it has the best overall care, it is a burden to me. In my experience, this isn't something a lot of people think about when getting dog - that it is generally a 12-15 year responsibility for whoever is taking care of it and that means doing beyond the bare minimum of keeping it alive.

The above story has contributed to me being very conscious of whenever I'm put in a position to make a decision that will potentially affect me long term. 

I've recently decided that I do not want to have kids and she said I'm the first person she'd ever think about having kids with. On top of that, I've been having dreams of getting married and regretting it with her, but saying yes to make her happy (is it really happy if I'm lying). Thoughts about these things don't elicit a positive reaction in me. 

I brought both of these things with her and the direction was leading to a split or break - we've been quite silent but crying seperately together. It makes me cry when I think of all the things we've done and what a genuine person she is over the last few years I've known her. But for me to continue and think that a similar situation might come up where I'm regretting it will make it harder to leave down the track 5-10 years from now and waste both our time. She on the other hand feels different and can see her being with me for the rest of her life.

How can anyone be so sure of this? I know people my age (even younger) that feel that same feeling she does and being so certain.

**tl;dr** Having issues with committing to anything long term in my relationship, SO OTOH is so sure about it. I've had times in the past that have contributed to me no wanted to commit to anything. How can anyone be so sure about what they want?",2019-07-08 12:55:38,1,1,relationship_advice

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Do you like horror movies?"" Her: ""Yeah but only with someone to hold my hand"" Me: ""Same here"" Her: ""It would probably be amazing with you next to me"" Me: ""\*Flirty joke\*"" Her: ""We would probs be busy doing other things than actually watching the movie""

&amp;#x200B;

She's called me cute several times I complimented her as well and she said I made her happy with that, and she said ""You just want to kiss me \[on our first date\]."" in response to something I said and, she even called me after that at 12am and talked for like an hour. One of the topics we talked about was like shaving your genital area, and she said she only trims and asked me if I cared about that or not \[I said no\]. At the end she told me to stay on the phone but we didn't have to talk as we both laid in our beds and I was cool with it cus why not right.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess where I am going here is, we are going to the dog park today later, at around 1pm, do you guys think I should up the ante here? Like go for the kiss at the end or something \[I know the only go 90% her the last 10% thanks to that one film xD\] but I truthfully haven't actually dated anyone before and never gone on a date so talking to her the past few days has been really a lot to take in and it's grey territory for me.

(on my phone so sorry for any typos or mistakes)

So some info about me (17M) and I'm introvert as hell basically I don't speak to anyone unless they speak to me... And when I do it's through IG FB or any other social media. I just want a simple conversation.  It's not like a don't have friends. I just want relationship. Someone I can talk to about anything.
But recently this thing keeps happening to me and I don't know what to do about. So basically when I'm texting with some girl and she's nice to me and the respond time is acceptable and after some time I usually ask if she would like to out... Sometimes it's yes sometimes it's no. Not a big deal. But when I discover some minor flaw I start to lose interest in her no matter everything else she has (how she behaves, funny etc.). I don't know what to do with this.

331,cakm2v,HardDangNite,Am I [25F] a jerk for not inviting my half brother [40M] to my destination wedding?,"My half brother[40M], and I [25F] have never had a real relationship. He grew up with his mom as stepfather, and has always acted like he was better then the rest of us, and was never really around when I was a kid, but of his own doing. Whenever he comes to the state, he lives in California and we live in Colorado, he barely ever comes to visit us. I tried for a long time to have a relationship with him, but he just wasn‚Äôt interested so I gave up. I always felt like I had a bit of a dad complex with him because I just didn‚Äôt understand why he didn‚Äôt like me no matter how hard I tried, and I‚Äôve come to realize it‚Äôs probably because our dad and I are so close, and they have never been like that. 
Anyway, my fianc√© [29M] and I are planning a very small destination wedding in Europe with maybe 20 guests, and mostly just family. My fianc√©, my mom and dad[60s M and F], and I talked it over and we all agreed there is no point to inviting my brother because not only can he not afford it, but he wouldn‚Äôt come anyway, and I would just be disappointed. We are going to have a small party when we get home for everyone who couldn‚Äôt make it, and invite him to that. 
Well he was talking to my mom and told her that he would like to come to the wedding if he can get the money together, but knowing him he probably can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been talking to a few of my friends and other family, and they can‚Äôt believe I wouldn‚Äôt invite him. Even my mom is saying I should just invite him so he can‚Äôt be mad about it later, and he probably won‚Äôt come still. So now I‚Äôm starting to feel bad, like I should even if he doesn‚Äôt come. I don‚Äôt want to talk to him about it, because we never talk, and I don‚Äôt want to deal with the drama. I also hate myself when I‚Äôm around him because I feel like I‚Äôm trying to impress him, which is not like me at all.

334,cakl37,Garomzal,I [23M] can not stop thinking that women are not worth a relationship,"After high school I started to have depressive problems.   


It started with the fact that my high school love broke up with me because of the way I looked and because I was poor (I was very thin, had long hair and my family was poor). It was not like I did nothing about it. Even before breakup, I started going to the gym, went to college and started working in the cinema. She admitted that the reason was appearance and money. I often saw her with older, richer and more handsome ones, which made it even harder. Sometimes when I saw her in club, she would kiss with some guy only for me to see this and feel worse.   


After a while, I started meeting a new girl. I really loved her. Unfortunately, because of previous girl, I was afraid that I would be too poor, too ugly and too childish for her which reflected on our relationship. She knew perfectly well the reason for my behavior, and I started going to a therapist. I thought it was the worst period of my life, but it was going the right direction, and it will finally end. Unfortunately I found out that my girlfriend was cheating on me, with an older guy, with stable work and money (I graduated and I was going change job from cinema to work in the profession). As before, she admitted that the reason for the break was money.  I started having suicidal thoughts, but my friends and therapist helped me a lot.  


Now, after almost a year, I earn a lot of money for my age (working as a programmer), I look more attractive than ever (after all this time I feel confident about my look) and feel that life goes in the right direction. Women are interested in me quite often, but even when we start getting closer, I do not feel that I can trust a woman anymore. I do not take them seriously. I can kiss a couple of girls at one party without hesitation, even when the ones I've kissed earlier see this (which is not making me feel bad at all). I do not feel that they are worth a relationship. I can not trust them, but after all I would like to fall in love again and have a loved one. I'm really not a misogynist. I know that women are good, and worth loving, but at the back of my head I have a voice that tells me that he will cheat on me anyway, so I do not have to treat them with due respect. It's just like when I'm alone, I'm thinking about this and I know that I have a problem, but when I see girl I can't stop thinking that she's not worth me.   


Maybe I should wait for ""the perfect one"", and I will change? Maybe I'm not able to live in relationship? I'm feeling really   
 bad about it and want to change my behavior, but seriously I can't. I really need some advice from people at my age, or with similar problem.",2019-07-08 12:46:20,4,0,relationship_advice
335,cakkxo,punchthehorizon,[Lesbian] Should I go for this relationship even though my past experiences and anxiety is making me second guess my feelings?,"I‚Äôm going to try and keep this as short as possible but, man, I would appreciate you guys helping me with this. Also first post, yay?



So I‚Äôm a lesbian, [22]l came out last year although I‚Äôve always known 



Every ‚Äòthing‚Äô I‚Äôve had with a girl has lasted longest three months, and all ended badly. Be it them ending things and going for another girl after citing they weren‚Äôt ready for a relationship or even leaving me for a guy. I‚Äôve never had a healthy experience with girls and I think its affected me for the worst. It seems the second I fall for them it ends and I‚Äôm left reeling. 



This brings me to ‚ÄòHannah‚Äô [21] fake name of course. We had a friends with benefits thing for a month back in January after meeting on tinder. We both were rebounding and it was good. We stayed friends after as well, we get along incredibly well and I‚Äôve always wondered if I should have tried dating her.



My most recent thing was with a girl lets call her ‚ÄòLucy‚Äô. Lucy was four years younger than me at 19, extremely attractive girl who I definitely crushed hard on and we had a quick intense thing before she said she wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship but wanted to continue seeing me. I didn‚Äôt want to end up getting stronger feelings and end up potentially ditched so I ended things. But I guess I still have small feelings for her, as I found out she‚Äôs dating another girl now and it felt like a kick to the teeth. But I know I shouldn‚Äôt feel like that considering it was a very short thing although we bonded quickly and I was her first time with a girl. I guess I just feel like I am a buffer for people, an emotional crutch for them to use before they go off to ‚Äòproperly‚Äô date someone. Lucy being the third time in a row this has happened. 



Anyway, back to Hannah. We reconnected and decided to hang out and it was great, got along great and there was definite sexual tension which she admitted she also felt. I asked her on a date and we have been hanging out more, agreeing to start seeing each other slowly to see where things go. 



This is where I need advice. 



She‚Äôs very similar to me, including similar experiences with girls to me. She‚Äôs caring, kind, and really fucking funny. We spent eleven hours just talking yesterday and I feel insanely comfortable around her. She is really into me, she tells me that a lot and it‚Äôs reassuring knowing someone likes me. But I feel so strange. One day I do have feelings for her want to see her etc, the next I‚Äôm second guessing if I should be doing this. If I‚Äôm just doing this because I know she will be unlikely to fuck me over. I have anxiety, and I think that combined with my last experience is messing me up. And I keep occasionally thinking about Lucy, but I feel that‚Äôs entirely physical attraction. 



It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm so used to being infatuated with girls and ending up crushed, while this seems like a very slow burning crush. Which I‚Äôm worried about, it‚Äôs obviously better than falling hard and fast and it ending just as fast. But I don‚Äôt know if this is me forcing myself to get feelings or if my brain is going into survival mode saying ‚ÄúHey this girl is good for you, you aren‚Äôt used to that, run away and go back to those other girls‚Äù



I‚Äôve told her I feel like this, and she admitted she has similar anxiety. So that was reassuring. We are going very slow, no sex at all. Although when I kiss her man it‚Äôs like electricity. 



Anyway I‚Äôm sorry for the long post, I would appreciate any advice. Should I continue to slowly date her and see where it goes or end things based on what I‚Äôve said. I am pretty inexperienced with feelings and such hence the post. I don‚Äôt want to end up hurting her at all that‚Äôs my biggest fear. 


TL;DR
Been used as a rebound by girls constantly, this girl is actually good for me, but my brain is telling me to run away. Should I push through or end things

I know it‚Äôs sounds funny but it‚Äôs true. I think it started about last year. He started watching those Ben Shapiro owned compilation videos but I thought he was doing ironically. Now it has gotten to the point where we‚Äôre sitting down at the table eating dinner and he unironicaly says some shit like ""there is no place for women in the work industry"" It‚Äôs so weird. He was never like that before. This kid used to love Obama but now he hates his guts out of like nowhere. He‚Äôs always telling me some stupid shit and his defence is ""just watch one of BirdMans videos and you‚Äôll know""
I checked out this birdman guy and you don‚Äôt really have to watch his videos to know what he‚Äôs about. He‚Äôs one of those guys. ""The SJWs are at it again"" YouTubers. He‚Äôs obsessed with the dude.

Im bisexual and I haven‚Äôt come out yet so all the anti gay shit he says can be extremely hurtful. It‚Äôs not like I can tell my parents about it. It‚Äôs sucks because despite the crap he says he still looks up to me and I don‚Äôt know how he‚Äôd react if he found out.
I know these guys he‚Äôs watching has a some control over him because we went to the  to watch captain marvel and he liked it. And then he comes back telling me it was dogshit because of a video he saw.

It‚Äôs just so crazy to me. Like, this kid Doesn't even know the names of any of the political parties and he‚Äôs acting like he‚Äôs enlightened then everyone in our household because he watched a feminist owned compilation?

Do I do anything? My parents don‚Äôt really know much about this part of youtube. They‚Äôre right leaning but...not that right leaning. Or do I just wait till he grows up and realize how cringey this all was?",2019-07-08 12:45:09,9,0,relationship_advice
338,cakjkz,Blank-VII,"My [M/23] fiance√© [F/22] of 5 years is not my type, but we're still very much in love. Where do we go from here?","So I've been with her for 5 years and over that time we've gone from teenagers into young adults. We've both changed and matured a ton and are totally different people. The issue here is that while she's more-or-less satisfied with who I've become, I'm having a lot of problems with her.

Our sex life was never crazy back when we first met, but it's gone very downhill and as she's taken on more responsibilities from work, sex has gone from rarely being on her mind to *never* being on her mind. I always initiate and she always says yes (sometimes begrudgingly, which makes me want to back out) and there's simply no passion.

Aside from sex, as I mentioned she's become a workaholic. This means that when she's at home she's only awake for about 4 hours before she goes to bed, and goes to work again the next day. We used to game together and relax, but now she's a very solo kind of person and wants to just recharge on her own. I still come over and watch TV with her and stuff but we never really do anything I'd like to do anymore, not for more than 10 minutes or so before she goes back to her own down time. Don't get me wrong, I totally understand and respect her personal space, but it's not enough for me. As a human with feelings, I'm craving a little more than she's able to give. She's not an affectionate person either so most of the time now I'm just feeling lonely, even if she's right next to me.

So to summarize - She used to be my type (gaming, hanging out, a little more interest in sex) and now she's totally changed. Breaking up is out of the question because we both still love each other very much as people, we're loyal and the relationship is safe, we're just seemingly getting more and more incompatible over time. What options do we have? (Breaking up *will* be ignored, i'm afraid).

Thanks in advance for all your help!

*Ninja edit - We are VERY open people and discuss everything. She knows I feel this way about our issues and has told me she'd love to change, and even attempts to for a couple days until work overloads her again and she's too stressed to relax with me and do couple stuff. Again, I understand the position she's in, I'm just looking for some ways to make it easier for us to connect again.",2019-07-08 12:42:02,3,2,relationship_advice

I'm an English teacher. So its hard for me to understand what he means when he doesnt say exactly what he means. (He likes to use euphemisms that doesnt fit).

Granted, I have a short temper and impatience when things arent clearly explained. I always thought that guys had no issues expressing exactly what they think, but this case is a flip from the usual I guess. I'm the one that says and need things literally spelled out for me so that I dont risk misunderstanding people.

He also laxes on the chores when its highly overdue (we live in a room, really it isnt much to do, but I expect the laundry to be collected (never mind folded or cleared) before I get home from work) . Usually I'm the one asking and leading the chores doing. But honestly when I'm working and need him to pick up the slack a little he plays games instead. Just an added info, he is studying. Not working.

There are a lot of minor issues here and there too like him not putting things the place where he got it, and similar stuff. I have been trying not to snap. But I really dont know how to deal with my frustrations when small things come together so repeatedly like that.

We've talked about problems. A lot. So communication ( with much effort) isnt lacking.

Since then my trust for him has been rocky at best, catching myself wishing I could go through his phone, and actually doing it once when I saw he‚Äôd been messaging someone suspicious. I don‚Äôt like feeling this way, but I feel like there has been absolutely no effort made on his part to help me trust him again. 

Things have been fine since the first incident happened, I‚Äôve had little to no reason not to trust him, but my feelings won‚Äôt go away. I am constantly on my toes about whether or not he‚Äôs lying to me, and some of his actions don‚Äôt really help. 

He really likes his privacy. An open phone policy is completely out of the question, and I‚Äôd be crazy for asking. I‚Äôve never given him a reason to not trust me, but he‚Äôs allowed to use my phone for whatever. He checks text messages for me, answers my phone sometimes, scrolls reddit or instagram, and gets on my snapchat. I‚Äôve never been allowed on his phone. He‚Äôs asked me one time to check it for him right after all of it happened, in a perceived half assed attempt to show me I can trust him.

Recently, I‚Äôve noticed that he‚Äôs changed his settings to not allow notifications to be on his lock screen at all. And he‚Äôs changed his password from the one I knew, when I asked him about it,
(‚Äúyou changed your password?‚Äù
yeah??‚Äù)
he just sounded off. That could be my head working against me, but I‚Äôm not sure. Then I tried to use his phone to set an alarm, and I‚Äôm pretty sure he changed it again since I‚Äôve known what the last one was. 

Lately he‚Äôs been talking heavily about marriage, and I just want to know I can trust him before that happens. In my heart I don‚Äôt feel like he‚Äôs hurting me, but my head is so strung out with thoughts that have absolutely no proof. I worry every time he leaves the house that he‚Äôs lying about where he‚Äôs going, I worry about who he‚Äôs messaging, I worry about his friendships with our friend‚Äôs girlfriends. I have nightmares about it sometimes. So I‚Äôm not sure if what I perceive as suspicious is actually real or not. 

I just feel crazy, like I don‚Äôt know whether the way I feel has any real weight or not. I don‚Äôt know how to approach him without sounding accusatory and making him shut down. **I just need help in figuring out how to talk to him about it without him feeling like I‚Äôm throwing him under the bus and crushing him with it.**

347,cakdhf,ItzButterflyEffect,I‚Äôm struggling to have patience with my boyfriends depression.,"My boyfriend and I have been with each other two years. And lived with each other a year and a half. (We moved in quick due to practicality). 

We‚Äôre both finishing up our law degrees and it‚Äôs going pretty well. However, my boyfriend got some bad news back about a firm that offered him a job. They ended up retracting the offer - they gave some vague reasoning but nothing conclusive. It came out of nowhere and really hit my boyfriend hard. 

I‚Äôm lucky enough to have never suffered from depression, my family has suffered through a lot of mental illness and I am aware of how much it can effect people. That‚Äôs why I feel so awful that I‚Äôm not having patience for my boyfriends struggles. 

After the firm revoked his offer, he got very depressed for the first time in his life. He stopped going into uni, stopped studying for his exams. And basically plays fortnite with his friends or watches YouTube all day. I can tell he‚Äôs not listening properly when we speak. And it feels like I‚Äôm just in the background of his life 24/7. He kept saying it was just exam stress. And once his exams were done he‚Äôd be back to normal. But then he ended up postponing his final exams as he hadn‚Äôt studied. And is still struggling to do anything. 

I moved back to my family home for a few months as I‚Äôve got a temp job and my parents home is a lot closer to it. I also thought the space might do him good. And perhaps seeing me be so busy with jobs and volunteering might motivate him. It hasn‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôm watching his exams creep up on him and he‚Äôs not even started studying. He‚Äôs not sending in applications and saying he can‚Äôt be bothered to even sit his exams anymore. I know this is a symptom of depression but it‚Äôs so frustrating watching everything he‚Äôs wanted his entire life get pushed aside. 

I don‚Äôt enjoy being in the background either. He‚Äôs also become quite cynical, meaning in our conversations so we tend to get into squabbles as he just takes such a negative view of everything it ruins nice conversations. He‚Äôs just completely different to how he was before. Part of the reason we got together was similar ambition and being adventurous in our lives and trying to do as much as possible. 

He doesn‚Äôt want to go to therapy a) because the wait is too long 6 weeks for an appointment and his exams will be done by then. And b) he doesn‚Äôt think it will help. 

How can I help him actually push through this depressive episode? Or is it something I need to wait for him to get through alone? Would I be a bitch for breaking up with him due to his depression?


TLDR: 
My previously very ambitious boyfriend has lost all motivation to do anything after having a law job offer revoked out the blue. It‚Äôs been going on for months and it feels like I‚Äôm not in a relationship anymore because conversations are strained due to his new cynicism and I don‚Äôt know how to help him get through it.

On top of that I tend to carry the mental load.  Dishes, laundry, changing the sheets, taking out the trash, cleaning the bathroom?

It kind of feels like he‚Äôs saying ‚Äújust because you don‚Äôt like it doesn‚Äôt matter because other people do.‚Äù There are a lot of things he doesn‚Äôt like and I usually will be like ‚Äúoh yeah I understand or oh I really do like that I enjoy it, but there‚Äôs nothing wrong with you disliking it.‚Äù I know this issue isn‚Äôt that big of a deal and some people will call me stupid for even complaining about it. I‚Äôve actually joked around with him and told him that he says it a lot and I think he‚Äôs started to realize that it‚Äôs something he has made a habit of.I get that he‚Äôs taking a more open minded view to it, but a lot of these things he claims ‚Äúsome people like that‚Äù to are things he doesn‚Äôt even like so I find it confusing that he feels the need to say it? But he has his moments where he can not necessarily be a smart ass, but wants to be able to find an answer to everything if possible just bc he has a problem solving type personality. I don‚Äôt personally think he wants me to feel terrible about it, but I don‚Äôt like the fact that it basically disregards whatever opinion I may have. 

TL;DR: my boyfriend says ‚Äúsome people like that‚Äù to everything I dislike and it makes my opinion feel disregarded.",2019-07-08 12:21:12,6,1,relationship_advice
352,cakb3y,throwaway5151husband,Getting daily head [31M] from cheating wife? [25F],"I know how this sounds. I [31M] and my wife [25F] have been married for 3 years. I thought we were completely happy. 

I found out a 3 weeks ago through a mutual friend that she has been cheating on me with a co-worker for about 2 months. I decided that for my revenge I would get what I never usually get, blowjobs. I thought she would be feeling extra guilty from the affair (since she actually had been acting sweeter than usual and saying yes to things more often) and my thoughts were correct.

I asked her to suck me off and not stop until I said to, and she agreed. She NEVER liked it while we were dating even though I always asked and was willing to reciprocate. She blew me for an hour or so today, and I was decently rough.

The past two weeks have been amazing sexually. Head was always my favorite thing and I gave that up for her. I‚Äôm getting it whenever I want, multiple times a day now. I can ask her to stop eating dinner and suck me off and she will do it. We have no kids yet so nothing to worry about there. 

I‚Äôve only told one friend about this and he thinks I‚Äôm disgusting for doing it. Shouldn‚Äôt I be the one getting all the sympathy? I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôll keep it going, but I‚Äôm sort of enjoying the rough revenge blowjobs for now. Should I keep doing this? 

Can I do this until I feel better and not divorce her? I‚Äôm not finding any answers here yet. 

Tl;dr Wife cheated, feels guilty, doesn‚Äôt know that I know. Get lots of head from it.",2019-07-08 12:18:29,8,0,relationship_advice

354,cak920,ktruss1,Am I overthinking this? Should we even be together?,"Basically, the guy I was in love with started changing for the worse around January. I‚Äôm not going to go into details but it progressed to me not trusting him and feeling drained emotionally and I wanted him to go to his moms house towards the end of February but bad communication between friends ended up in him leaving me for good. He decided he was miserable after not fighting to stay and fix things and I didn‚Äôt take him back. Why take someone back who can leave so easily? 

I went through a bad depression binge drinking and now can‚Äôt even remember what I did the months we were apart but I reached out to him in May and we decided to pick things back up again. I found out he was planning to propose and all of the things he was hiding and lying about all of the sudden became justified. I now feel like shit about this but we also had problems and the break made us stronger. 

Life should‚Äôve been perfect but it‚Äôs not. There was another girl. This should be ok because he chose me but the whole thing unsettled me. He started talking to her and sleeping with her not even a month after we broke up. All I‚Äôm saying is if you end things with the girl you were going to spend the rest of your life with wouldn‚Äôt it take a little longer than a month to develop feelings for a new person? 

Anyways, I went on a cruise at the end of May and they were still friendly. I came back and checked his location so I could meet up with him. He was at her house. And then lied to me about it. I told him I knew and was upset bc he sent me a shirtless pic from her bed that morning thinking he could hide his location. He says it‚Äôs not a big deal but why in the hell would you sneak to essentially your exes house and sleep in her bed naked with her while you know your gf is away and can‚Äôt find out? 

My point is, we just started dating again and that moment completely destroyed my trust and confidence. She keeps popping up in my mind because I don‚Äôt trust him and I feel like a maniac. He also doesn‚Äôt communicate his feelings well but shows it by buying me things. This sounds grand but I don‚Äôt get the affection I crave and feel like he just takes me places to ‚Äúmake it up‚Äù to me so I won‚Äôt doubt him. But I do. Bc he‚Äôs told me before he just wants to go do things and doesn‚Äôt care who it‚Äôs with. 

I was very confident while we were apart and now I feel so small. And the problem isn‚Äôt communication because I keep having this convo and it never goes anywhere. I tell him the issue I have with the way he treats me and he literally either doesn‚Äôt listen or laughs. I just want to cry all the time and I can feel that he‚Äôs just with me because I‚Äôm here. He always says ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm here aren‚Äôt I?‚Äù But fails to connect emotionally and keeps ignoring me. I‚Äôm starting to think his presence isn‚Äôt enough. 

I tell him I feel ugly and he tells me I need to hit the gym and lose weight. I‚Äôve lost about 30 pounds and he thinks I still look the same. I got tan and cut and dyed my hair and try to dress better and wear jewelry and paint my nails and face because I know he likes it. It‚Äôs still not good enough. He tries to control what I eat. He told me I‚Äôd look better if I was skinny. 

He used to tell me he‚Äôd never be able to go for a girl without curves after me but tell me why the girl he choose while we were apart was stick thin. He loved my big brown eyes but hers looked like the ocean. I don‚Äôt want to compare but when I was having issues I told him she was prettier than me and he agreed. So my question is why is he even with me? He told me she‚Äôs back with her ex and now I just wonder if that‚Äôs the only reason keeping him with me. I truly believe he still wants her but is just with me because he‚Äôs settling for worse because it‚Äôs easier. 

He also told me he wants his partner to be active and healthy but I am. That he liked that she had a little tummy but didn‚Äôt like that she didn‚Äôt have a butt. I have the butt and also have a tummy but not a big one and he‚Äôs still not happy. 

He also tells me he‚Äôs attracted to confidence and I don‚Äôt have any. But why would I if he‚Äôs constantly diminishing it?? Like I said, I was very confident while we were apart and it ended pretty soon after we got back together. The other girl was very confident. I found a bikini pic she sent him after we got back together and he complimented her tits. I just don‚Äôt trust him anymore and he doesn‚Äôt give me a reason to. He just says to trust him. By why should I when he has already ruined the foundation? 

I bring this up and he says ‚Äúsorry, I‚Äôm a shitty person‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt want me to feel wanted just by changing the way he treats me. So my question is... am I wrong for feeling the way I do? Should I let this stuff go or silently be unhappy the rest of my life? 

I love this man with all my heart but it feels like I‚Äôm way more invested than him. He doesn‚Äôt get excited with me. We barely have sex. The last thing I want to do is let him go but do I deserve better if he can‚Äôt meet me in the middle? Is there even such thing as a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù?  Will I be able to be happy?

356,cak8e1,DifficultDiscussion2,"Wife pegged me, wanted me to admit liking it, it was actually a competition with her friends","sorry for mobile-non-english speaker, tldr in the end.

I (M, early 40) have always had great relationship with my wife (F, late 30ies). Married for almost 15 years, two small kids (pre-school age). Been good friends, respecting each other, intellectually stimulating, sexually open and compatible. All in all, I am have been really lucky guy.

Until now. Month ago wife proposed pegging. Yes, I knew beforehand what that is, but never had any real urge for it (neither no repulsion for it either). So we did it and the experience was kind of ""meh"" for me. I get the idea why people are into it, but it is not for me and tbh I do not want it again.

Afterwards wife jokingly started asking if I liked it. Told the truth. Conversatsion quickly escalated to me ""being not able to admit that i loved every second of it"", ""must overcome your toxical manhood"" etc. 

First i thought is was a joke, but as said - it quickly blew into full conflict. Next couple of days my wife either gave me the silent treatment or kept snapping at me for insignificant details (something that is completeley new behaviour for her). After that we sat down, and she came up that we will not have sex before I admint that i liked it and we shall make this pegging thing a regular thing in our sexlife. I said that i cant lie about liking it and the idea of being pegged once a week would not be acceptable. The argument blew up and got us nowhere.

To be honest I must admit that I contemplated the idea of lying to her that i liked that just to get back to normal life (kind of compromize that i say i like it, but would refuse repating it), but something happened. 

Her phone messenger gave notification sound couple of days ago (from her close friends grouop chat) and it was on the table in front of me and it showed the first line of message. It was something like ""hey, have you been able to break your bitch?"". So i unlocked her phone and read it (we share most of passwords and I happened to have remembered her - never used it before). 

So what I understood (could not read much longer as she came from shower) - is that her close friends (3 females, approx same age, 1 is divorced, 1 is married, 1 is single) have some kind of competition/dare to fuck as many males with a dildo and ""break the bitches"" as possible. And discussing it in a great detail and in a very derogative manner.

Now the idea to lie about liking pegging is not a good idea and the problem is bigger.

What I know:

\- I will not lie about liking pegging, just wont. We have (or rather - have had to my knowledge) open communication not going to lie. We tried anal with her years ago, she said she did not like it - never brought it up.

\- this mess is not a sexual problem, it is a larger one

\- honestly the idea of discussing and bragging about our sex life with friends..., I feel repulsed.

my head is a mess, it is almost a month, and the situation has not eased a bit - if not become even worse. I love my wife but the resentment (not even know the right word) is growing with hours, i can feel it. 

I really do not know what to do. Divorce is not an option.

tldr: wife pegged me, wanted me to admit loving it (I did not), I do not want to lie. And now it seems that is was some kind of competition for her friends.",2019-07-08 12:10:24,18,0,relationship_advice
357,cak8a2,throwawaygirl0193,I (20F) feel like my boyfriend (21M) harassed me but he says he was just joking,"I‚Äôve been dating my boyfriend for almost 2 months now but I‚Äôm a virgin and I only kissed guys before. I am really inexperienced lol but he always said it was fine and we could go slow

So we went on a date and then we got back to my apartment around like 11. I live with 3 of my friends and we have a group chat and we were gonna all watch a movie together so when he pulled up in front of my apartment, I texted them saying he dropped me off and I‚Äôd be up in a minute. 

I was just gonna give him a quick kiss goodbye and go upstairs to the movie but he wanted to talk a little and kind of make out. So I was like fine, I talked a bit, I kissed him. So then I told him ok I have to go now, they‚Äôre waiting for me so bye. He locked his car doors and I think he put the child safety lock on or something bc I couldn‚Äôt unlock it and the unlock button was on my door too so that was weird, I should have been able to unlock it. It freaked me out but I thought he was joking or playing around so I just told him to open it and I really have to go and he said he wanted to keep me for a little longer. I tried discreetly texting my friends that he locked me in his car bc I was scared and I didn‚Äôt know what to do and then he took my phone from my hand and wouldn‚Äôt give it back and he put it like in that area on the car door Towards the floor, like a tiny compartment thing idk if you guys know what I‚Äôm talking about. Basically I couldn‚Äôt reach it. And then he said i make him really horny and I told him ok sorry about that and asked him again to please open the door and he said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not leaving until you make me cum.‚Äù I got scared because the doors were locked and he took my phone too so it was a really uncomfortable situation. I tried to ask him again to just let me go upstairs and I said I didn‚Äôt wanna do that stuff yet and I was so tired and I tried to change the topic too but he kept harassing me and he kept me in his car for like 30 minutes 

Eventually my friends noticed I texted them before that I arrived but I never went upstairs so one of them came downstairs to see where I was and she found his car and knocked on the window and then he gave me my phone back and let me out. 

Tbh I was so scared and freaked out, I told my friends that he locked me in his car and told me to make him cum. It was a really scary experience. that never happened to me before. Even writing it out is making my stomach churn I feel sick. It was really really scary and weird 

He called me afterwards and I declined his call bc I really didn‚Äôt wanna talk and then he kept calling so I texted him that it was really messed up what he did by locking me in and pressuring me. And then he said ‚ÄúI was just joking, obviously I know you‚Äôre not ready for that, I was kidding I can‚Äôt believe you took it seriously, it was a joke‚Äù. it wasn‚Äôt a very funny joke, whatever it was.

358,cak7xy,KiNgOfSpEEdOJaCK,This subreddit has double standards with guys and girls issues reactions,"First of all, I have to say this subreddit has been useful and has many good people that are always ready to help with whoever has problem, just to say.

But as I was browsing posts that are related to guys having micropenises AND posts that are related to girls having abnormal parts(I mean like boobs) I found some interesting stuff.

Let's take as example this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9mgjp7/new_boyfriend_has_a_micropenis_need_some_advice/), you see how many upvotes and support from everyone it got, right? Even you see people that are saying you should break up with him, first of all, I'm not here to argue about these stuffs as I know micropenis in like 90% of situations is just a huge deal breaker.

However, I noticed [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ast88s/best_relationship_of_my_38m_life_but_i_struggle/) post where it is about a girl that has very small boobs and the boy wants advice how to deal with it, look at comments he got and upvotes he got(literally 0), most comments even say that he's a troll and it was a shallow reason to break up with her. So to get this straight, this subreddit thinks that a micropenis is a breakup and a very valid reason to concern BUT tits which is preference for most guys(Most guys including me don't like small tits) is a stupid and shallow reason to concern or breakup? Seriously, r/relationship_advice? Just because she has a vagina doesn't make her an angel from sky that shouldn't be dumped for the same reasons guys get dumped. After all, small tits are a valid reason to break up as much as micropenises/small penises.

I mean, I could get many more posts about double standards about the clear treatment between guys and girls but I think this is enough.",2019-07-08 12:09:02,107,0,relationship_advice
359,cak7dn,throwaway28397372,I (22F) am struggling to cope with how my ex (24M) treated me,"LONG READ

This is very, very confusing for me and I hope I describe the situation as best I can... I was in a relationship for almost 4 years. It ended last year, we ended on good terms, as friends. I ended it because I just kind of realized that I wasn‚Äôt happy. I wanted my future to look different than it would if I stayed with him. I was numb. It took me a very long time to realize I was unhappy. I was so focused on our future and what I thought I wanted that I ignored every red flag and the toxicity that was our relationship. I met him when I was 17. Prior to him I had never dated or even been interested in anyone else. Shortly after ending things, I met someone else. The way he talks to me, the way he treats me, has made me realize how... wrong my ex was. How terrible he was. It‚Äôs taken me months and lots of therapy sessions to work through everything and realize that he was, in fact, abusive. He would yell at me for the littlest things, and it didn‚Äôt matter who was around. My friends, his friends. He never wanted to put forth effort or show that he cared, I think he saw it as some sort of weakness. He was just completely emotionally unavailable. I‚Äôm pretty sure his friends hated me, I know that to at least one of them he would always talk bad about me and make fun of me behind my back. He also lied constantly, even about the smallest, dumbest things because he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want to make me mad‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt have anything to compare all of this to, and so I guess I just thought it was normal. When I would argue with him about it, I was always ‚Äúbeing dramatic or unreasonable‚Äù and then he‚Äôd always end up apologizing and saying he‚Äôd do better so idk I forgave him. Again and again. Until around 2.5 years in, when I finally broke up with him. He had blocked me on social media so I wouldn‚Äôt know that he was ignoring my text messages. So that he could ignore me in peace. This time he didn‚Äôt apologize and it wasn‚Äôt a big deal and I was crazy. But I knew he‚Äôd crossed a line so I ended it. And like a dumbass, two weeks later I took him back because he promised to genuinely change. And honestly, he did. For the last year of our relationship, he was moderately ok. He was very resigned and there wasn‚Äôt any more big fights, except for when I found a picture of his naked ex girlfriend on his laptop. The picture was dated 4 or 5 days before our 1st anniversary. I thought he‚Äôd cheated, but he showed me texts between he and his best friend that proved he found the picture when looking at a porn site and he was concerned she may not know... then the texts turned to him saying how much he loved and missed her and how different she was and how he‚Äôd leave anyone for her. I was very hurt. When reading these messages I also came across texts between them where he was making fun of me and talking bad about me. He also sent the picture of his ex to one of his other friends to look at. Not out of concern for her, but because his friend asked ‚Äúwhere the hoes at‚Äù in exchange for an invite to a party. He told me in graphic detail about way too many of his past flings. I was very insecure in this relationship. 

Honestly, if these were the only things he did to me I think I‚Äôd have moved past it already. I think I‚Äôd be fine. But in the past few months I‚Äôve come to accept the fact that he sexually assaulted me several times over the course of our relationship. I had always wanted to save myself for marriage. Always. When I met him, I‚Äôd never even kissed someone. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to do anything other than kissing. He did not respect these boundaries and was SUPER pushy when we met about wanting to go further. He would just whip his dick out and if I told him to stop he‚Äôd get annoyed. One time he started jerking off and I told him to stop and just kind of turned away from him and he got mad and I felt terribly guilty because he told me he was so frustrated because I was a tease, etc. One time I wore a dress so he touched me even when I told him to stop but it felt nice so I just let it happen. And then I felt guilty because I let him touch me but I still refused to touch him. And so I gave in there too. He literally told me one time that he wanted to fuck me even if I said no until I started liking it, but that would be rape. My response was, ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs not rape.‚Äù Because I was 17 and naive and had no fucking clue that is literally rape. And 4 or 5 times I would wake up in the middle of the night and he‚Äôd be touching me. And when I moved he would stop and pretend to be asleep. Another time we were making out and he started jerking off, and I asked him to stop because my parents were supposed to be meeting us soon and I was terrified they‚Äôd walk in on us. He wouldn‚Äôt  stop even though I was begging him to, I think I almost cried. And when he told me he was going to cum, I didn‚Äôt know what to do so I let him cum in my mouth and then nearly threw up because I was so upset. I think I mentally blocked all of these memories out during our relationship- but the whole time we dated I hated sex. I loved having sex, but afterwards it always made me feel so terrible and bad about myself. We‚Äôd go months where I told him I wanted to abstain, but I always ended up giving in and even initiating it myself, though I think it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs the only time I got any sort of affection from him. 

I just. Am so mad at myself. I hate myself for letting him treat me the way he did and staying for so, so long. I hate that he thinks we‚Äôre on good terms, as we haven‚Äôt spoken since the break up. I feel like none of my feelings towards him are justified because I stayed for so long. And I‚Äôm confused because during that last year he didn‚Äôt touch me inappropriately anymore or talk bad about me to people. He still wasn‚Äôt good, he just wasn‚Äôt a pile of shit. Does that mean he wasn‚Äôt abusive? I don‚Äôt know. My mom doesn‚Äôt know about the ways he assaulted me and said to me ‚Äúhe was broken but he wasn‚Äôt a bad guy.‚Äù And I told her that yes, he was a bad guy and her response was ‚Äúthen why‚Äôd you date him for so long.‚Äù And now I just can‚Äôt help but feel like the biggest dumbass on the planet. Why did I date him so long? I know that he treated me terribly but I stayed because I thought I loved him and in my mind he didn‚Äôt treat me terribly. In my mind we were great and happy. And now I can‚Äôt believe I ever thought that. Am I crazy? Was what he did to me really assault or am I being dramatic? Am I stupid? What is wrong with me that I would stay and how do I reconcile that the person I loved and wanted to marry was actually terrible to me?

TLDR; my ex was a terrible person and I‚Äôm confused and tired of thinking about it and every time I think I‚Äôve boxed it up I remember some other way that he hurt me or touched me inappropriately and have to go through the process of forgiving myself again. I just need advice. I need people who have been where I have I just need to hear that it goes away.",2019-07-08 12:07:32,2,1,relationship_advice
360,cak7av,me24sal,(22F) My fianc√© (22M) accused me of stealing his money,"Last night my fianc√© came home from work and went into our closet to count the money he‚Äôs been saving. While he was doing that, I was in my daughters (4f) bedroom across the hall. He came in and said ‚Äúplease tell me that you took the $2k to pay the credit card debt‚Äù I said ‚Äúno I didn‚Äôt touch it, why?‚Äù 

He said the money was gone and that it didn‚Äôt just walk out by itself. Our daughter couldn‚Äôt have touched it because it‚Äôs somewhere she can‚Äôt reach. I told him that I never once even counted the money or touched it. A few days prior I asked him if we could loan my parents money ($300)  because they‚Äôve fallen on hard times, he said yes at the time but the next day he never gave me the money so I just left it alone because I didn‚Äôt want to press him about it. 

He‚Äôs been working overtime at work the last few days where he‚Äôs been barely getting any sleep and barely eating at work. Because of that, I have a few theories on what could have happened 

1) maybe he miscounted the money and doesn‚Äôt realize it because he‚Äôs been out of it (last night he left the back door unlocked which he never ever does) 

2) maybe he thought I was keeping track of the money and would realize that $2k was missing and that I would possibly question him about it 

3) maybe he placed the money else where and forgot where it is 

4) maybe he took it with him while at work and someone else took it 

5) maybe he‚Äôs lying 

He says I‚Äôm the only person to blame because I was the only one home. I‚Äôm a SAHM. No one has been in or out of our home in the last few days but us 3. We have cameras around our home so we know no one broke in and took it. I‚Äôve never stole money from anyone in my life and I would never lie to him directly to his face. I really hate confrontation (I get very Emotional quickly) so why would I knowingly take money and risk a confrontational talk with him. I know that he‚Äôs constantly counting his money, why would I take $2k and think he wouldn‚Äôt notice, what lie could I possibly come up with? I seriously think this is absurd. Now he‚Äôs giving me the silent treatment and being rude because he thinks I took it. 

Can anyone give me some advice? I really don‚Äôt know what to do to make him believe me.",2019-07-08 12:07:16,5,1,relationship_advice

362,cak6p5,Throwaway08072019,GF doesn't want me there when she's hanging out with male best friend,"&amp;#x200B;

Throwaway bacause GF knows I'm on reddit. My GF and I (M) have been dating for about 2 years. We're both late twenties. She's the love of my life and ever since I saw her I knew she was the one for me. Our relationship is absolutely fantastic, and even though we don't live together officially I'm at her apartment most of the time. Lately I've been thinking about asking her to marry me, but there's one thing that bothers me so much that happened and because of this I'm not sure what to do.

GF has a male best friend. This guy (I'll call him A) means absolutely the world to her and to be honest, I absolutely hate him. Bit of background: GF went to study abroad for 2 years when she was in university over 10 years ago. First year she lived with a local family, and A (he's 3 years younger) became her ""brother"". They got along really well, both parents worked so they spent a lot of time together. After a year she moved out but they continued to hang out often (also at her place even though that's not normal in their culture). When she told me this I wasn't happy (didn't let her know though), because she was in university and he was only in high school, just imagine a 16/17-year old living with an attractive 19-year old woman...

Fast forward to now. Since he lives on the other side of the planet I've never met him. She sees him about once every two years but they text and call all the time. I don't know what they're talking about because I don't understand the language. She says they just discuss his and her work, movies or shows they watch at the same time (they plan this), food, everything really. She repeatedly tells me they're just really good friends and she gets annoyed when I bring it up. This guy got really succesful the past few years and he probably has a couple million in his name now. I know he bought an apartment worth at least a 3-4 million a year ago. Girls basically throw themselves at him and he has a couple of million followers on social media. I'm pretty sure he likes my GF.

Three weeks ago A told her that he has to go somewhere about 500km from here for work, and she immediately began making plans for us to go meet him (he apparently even offered to book her a fancy hotel room in the same hotel he's staying at). GF says that I can come with her if I want, but only for drinks, she wants to have dinner with just the two of them. Her reasoning is that she wants me to meet A, but she also wants to just talk to him because they only see each other every once in a while and will feel awkward because we don't share the same language and she doesn't want to translate everything thus ""taking away time"". 

I feel really disrespected that she chooses another man over me and basically dumping me. I've tolerated her calling and texting him so often (even when I was over at her place) but I don't want her to meet him alone. She absolutely blew up when I told her this, telling me I don't trust her (I trust her but not him), and that I can't tell her who she can and can't see and that she's fed up with me nagging about him in a negative way all the time. She also said that if I was going to act like this I shouldn't bother coming with her at all because I'm going to spoil the mood.

Now A wants to take MY GF to a really expensive restaurant to ""thank her for all the support she gave him"" (my GF's words, again, I can't understand them when they talk) and I'm not welcome. He even showed her a wrapped present that he's going to give her (probably something expensive).

Am I wrong to ask her not to meet him alone? Am I overreacting? If she really loved me I feel she would not meet him alone out of respect for me.

Tl;dr: GF wants to meet male friend, but only wants me there for drinks and not the expensive restaurant he is taking her because we don't share the same language.",2019-07-08 12:05:33,26,1,relationship_advice

365,cak6hp,heuuuuuya,My boyfriend and I are doing long distance and has cheated on me in multiple ways.,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 3.5 years and we met while I was living in the states for work. I moved back to Europe to begin a phd and about a year later he followed and moved to Germany where he was able to get a work visa ( less strict protocol than the uk where I am based).  There was an occasion in the past when I found out that he had been messaging/ sexting girls on Instagram behind my back. Recently I found out that while still in America he and a friend slept together multiple times and in Germany he paid for a prostitute as well as sexting with another girl. He watches porn and has paid for cam girl sessions on Chaturbate as well. It is all now in the open and he has committed to therapy and I would like to as well ( finances are a slight issue here).  We have committed to making it work, getting help and trying to move on. His attitude to relationships is probably more open than me and he believes non- monogamy could work but I am unsure as to whether he wants that or has a peon addiction. I do not know if I would want an open relationship because I think that any relationship first needs honesty and trust.  I would be open to novel sexual experiences together. The thing that hurts me the most is the lies and I worry that while he says he will never do it again that he will behind my back. Obviously we need to rebuild trust.",2019-07-08 12:04:53,4,1,relationship_advice
366,cak686,throwaway11506,Is it okay to ‚Äúbreakup‚Äù over text in this situation?,"Okay so let me first preface this post by saying it isn‚Äôt really a breakup. We‚Äôve already broken up.

Basically, I met this girl about 6 months ago. I knew I was leaving soon to go to England for summer, and then I‚Äôm off to uni in October, so I knew it wouldn‚Äôt last and couldn‚Äôt be too serious. I told her all of this, said I really liked her but just wanted a temporary thing, which she agreed to and was okay with. We had a great time together, and then I left to England about 2 months ago.

When I left I said that was the end of it because I didn‚Äôt want to do long distance, as I felt me and her weren‚Äôt serious enough or invested enough for that challenge and I‚Äôd told myself never to do long distance after I was hurt so much and cheated on by my ex during long distance.

So me and her broke up. She really wanted to do long distance and stay with me because I‚Äôd be coming back soon and we‚Äôd have a couple more months until I went to uni. I said no I don‚Äôt want that now, but that when I get back I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd feel. I said getting back together could be a possibility but that I didn‚Äôt know what I wanted so she shouldn‚Äôt wait for me.

 We agreed to be friends. We still text often but the frequency has died down a lot compared to when we were together. Our texts now are completely platonic now, all the romantic stuff is gone, and I like where we‚Äôre at now.

I‚Äôve decided I enjoy being single and I see it as too much stress to reinitiate the relationship when I get back. I‚Äôm going back to my hometown in 2 weeks. I am excited to see her and she says she‚Äôs excited to see me, but I just want to be friends. I know I‚Äôm not in the place to have a relationship when I‚Äôm leaving to uni in 2 months, and I know I can‚Äôt give her what she wants/deserves.

I need to tell her this categorically and clearly, as I feel I left her with hope. Is it okay to do it over text? I know it‚Äôs bad to breakup over text but this isn‚Äôt really breaking up. We‚Äôve had a lot of time apart and a lot of time as just friends (2 months). I feel like I can explain myself better over text, plus, she seems to prefer talking about these matters over text, as that‚Äôs what she did to me when we first decided to break up. She didn‚Äôt want to discuss it on FaceTime.

What do you guys think?

tl;dr, ex gf who I broke up with before coming to England wants to get back with me for a bit when I get back to my hometown before I go to uni (in October). I thought I might want that, but told her not to wait. Now I‚Äôve decided I don‚Äôt want that, and need to tell her. Is it okay to do it over text since? I feel like I‚Äôll be able to explain myself better.",2019-07-08 12:04:05,3,1,relationship_advice
367,cak4t9,hxfehy,How can I be a better older sister?,"This was way longer than I anticipated, so TLDR at the end. 

I turned 19 last month, and for a while, I've known that I dont want to have children myself in the future, but I know that still have a duty to be a good older sister to my 5 younger siblings, (17F, 14F, 10M, 8F, 6M). I still live at home, and attend college relatively close, so we're still very much a part of each other's daily lives. 

My mother has been telling me for a couple of months that my siblings have complained to her that I'm too detatched from them. This is a result of my high school years, when I decided I had too much on my plate and I didnt want to be outright mean to them, so I thought the best way to not hurt them was to isolate myself. Minimal interaction meant that I had less of an opportunity to hurt/blow up at them, but I got too comfortable being alone and now, since I have more free time, I cant seem to actively spend huge amount of times with them without getting absolutely exhausted. 

I'm not a very patient person at ALL, and when I have to care for the younger ones, I get agitated and eventually start yelling at them if they're misbehaving or just being generally rowdy kids. I hate that I dont know how to be more understanding and find a different way to explain things to them (sitting and talking doesn't work by the way, they're annoyingly persistent in their troublemaking). I just dont know how to ACTUALLY enjoy being with them instead of seeing it as an exhausting chore.

I do think that my mother has not developed as much of an emotional connection with the younger ones the way she has with us older girls, due to mental illness issues and general burnout, so I do want to step up and be someone that they are comfortable discussing everything with, and I want them to know that they can come to me if they have any problems, but I know its more than just telling them. ( To clarify: my parents arent absent in any way, the kids are all taken care of very well, they have everything they could ever want or need, are definitely more spoiled than I was at their age, just attention being spread amongst 3 isnt the same as that being spread amongst 6)

Since starting a part-time job, Ive tried to buy them more things they like, taking them out for food/movies, but I know a couple of my friends are the youngest, and from their experience, financial care doesnt make up for a lack of emotional connection at all. 

I just feel sometimes that I'm at such a different stage from them in life that its hard to find connection points when they talk to me that arent 'oh when I was your age' or 'I remember worring about that' that become kind of lecture like and create distance of experience? The years between us arent ever going to lessen, but I know that if I dont work on it now, eventually it will be too late and they might not want me to be a meaningful part of their lives in the future. I know when we are adults with our own lives it will be more difficult to coordinate so we need to solidify strong relationships now before its too late. 

I know that it will take time to form a strong bond with them, but I need help knowing what steps I should take to be a better older sister for them.

TLDR: Siblings feel like I am too detatched from them, the age difference makes it hard for me to find connection points with them, asking what steps can I take to actually enjoy time I spend with them.",2019-07-08 11:59:53,7,30,relationship_advice
368,cak4n3,marylane13,"I thought I was in love before, and then I fell in love, and I really can‚Äôt imagine this feeling leaving. The roads are getting rockier these days, and I need advice to motivate me.","I‚Äôve always wanted to be in love. Love is the only reason I haven‚Äôt offed myself yet, to be 100% w y‚Äôall. I‚Äôve said it time and time again, and I‚Äôll say it as many times as I need to: I don‚Äôt care if we are living in a cardboard box on the side of the road, as long as I get to spend at least a moment with someone I truly love and I truly feel they love me back, I‚Äôm fine with meeting my soulmate and dying the next day, bc that‚Äôs all I want out of this life. And this isn‚Äôt an exaggeration on my part, I truly feel this way. That being said, my boyfriend (of over a little over half a year now) is one of the best things that has happened to me in a long time. 

A little background: before him, there was..we will call him G. More or less, G used me as his own personal ego booster. If he was feeling shitty, he would crawl back, typically after a few months of ghosting me, with some lame ass apology, usually followed by, ‚ÄòI just miss your energy‚Äô. And I would let him! Only for him to get a big head, and leave again. This was, what seemed to be, an endless cycle over the course of 3 years. Over that time, I became more aware of the role I played in his life, it became painfully obvious that he‚Äôd only loved that I loved him, not me. And the love I had for him soon faded after that. It was no longer possible for me to forgive him without entirely losing myself. Our relationship, while rocky and on and off from the get-go, slowly morphed into a terrifying petty beast, us doing most things purely out of spite to hurt one another. Well, finally I went one petty move too far, and he finally left (not permanently, unfortunately. We had a three year thing so to him I guess he feels like he owns me or something, but moral of that story, he won‚Äôt leave me alone now that I refuse to boost his ego and let him back lol). 

He ghosted me for the last time, last year, October. After that, it was just me and myself for a little bit. No, I wasn‚Äôt entirely alone, I had one night stands here and there, or sloppy drunk friendship hook ups to maintain my sanity (I easily get lonely). But I just couldn‚Äôt find anyone who was doing it for me, on both emotional and physical levels. I had convinced myself I was broken. Sex wasn‚Äôt the same with anyone, love songs made me cry. But I am actually thankful for this hopeless feeling. Bc my 2019 New Years resolution, for the first time since middle school, wasn‚Äôt about finding love or the one blah blah bullshit. For once in so long, my resolution was me. 12 days into the new year, at a party, off some acid, I sat down next to this guy at like 6 am and told him I‚Äôm putting my feet on him. And he just laid down and slept with me all night. 
I read a quote shortly after meeting him that said: Never go in search of love. Go in search of life, and life will find you the love you seek. I really wasn‚Äôt looking, I was doing me, living laugh, happy on my own for the first time in years. 

My bf is the best guy I‚Äôve dated (I‚Äôve only dated 3 but). He‚Äôs a Gemini, moon in Aries, and any of you astrology people know that‚Äôs quite pairing for one adolescent male. Learning to cope with his very opposite from myself, sociable and cocky personality has been a whole challenge in itself. But he‚Äôs got a lil baggage, which is okay, it‚Äôs just learning how to cope w that has been the real wall. 

First, he has serious mama issues. He loves his mama, but she doesn‚Äôt and never has loved him back the way he needs, so it makes him get all backed up emotionally quite often. Two, he sucks at keeping a job. And like I said, I don‚Äôt care if we are living in a cardboard box, I just want to be with him. But we talk about building our life together, and it seems more fictional than anything bc we aren‚Äôt workin toward it. And last, he‚Äôs got a crazy psycho ex baby mama. So baby mama drama. I‚Äôm a 19 year old, so I‚Äôve never dated anyone with kids. I‚Äôm good with kids, I like kids, his babygirl is absolutely precious. It‚Äôs not her that‚Äôs the issue. It the baby mama, trying control his life still even though they‚Äôve been broken up for over a year, using their daughter as some kind of pawn. And what‚Äôs worse, is their relationship was clearly never stable, and that was the longest relationship he‚Äôd been in (4yrs). Imagine the only real relationship you‚Äôve ever been in being nothing but petty comments, arguments, and just overall discomfort but not understanding how wrong it was bc it‚Äôs all your know (I can relate bc of fucking G). 

Therefore, he has the most wacked out communication skills, constantly avoiding telling me things he knows I will be upset about until it‚Äôs too late to do anything about it. His logic is shes gonna be upset either way, why not just deal with it later. The logic I am trying to instill in him is there is upset, pouting, and then there‚Äôs angry, frustrated. If you tell me sooner, when I first ask, I will pout and complain, but eventually accept it and move on. If you tell me later, when I had already asked, probably a few times, I will be angry bc you had plenty of opportunities to tell me. (Example: he says he will be home in a few hours with food, then he comes home right before bed without food, or will tell me late as hell that he couldn‚Äôt find a ride home, and won‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm upset when all I want is for him to tell me exactly what he‚Äôs doing when I ask the first time so I‚Äôm not waiting up for him.) He also constantly thinks I‚Äôm trying to argue with him, or yell at him. He‚Äôs always in defense mode and I‚Äôll have to remind him I was just asking a question and then he will relax. And he‚Äôs also very social, he gets restless very easily, so he likes to go out and about and do stuff. I am not like that so much, I like the comfort of our home. So sometimes, I will spend my entire day alone, even when I tell him that I wanted him for the day. 

And all these things clash with my very super sensitive, clingy crybaby brat personality. For obvious reasons. And I‚Äôm very aware that some of the walls and barriers are very well still there bc of how clingy and sensitive I can be. 

I guess what I wanted to ask you guys is, do you think I can help him break out of those old habits? And do you have any advice for any part or any problem that I have mentioned? Ways for me to cope with baby mama drama, ways for me to cope with my severe anxious overthinking, way to make him understand why communication is so important to me? I love this man beyond words, I don‚Äôt want him to resent me bc I take up all his time or bc he thinks we fight too much. And I understand that it‚Äôs going to take patience and compromising to break through some of these walls. So give me all the advice you can.",2019-07-08 11:59:23,4,3,relationship_advice

I finally realized that her jealousy is way over the line (0 interaction with any other females that aren't family related/ deleted my Instagram for having ""too many"" female followers/ won't let me hang with my friends because I could be with her instead/ reads every text message that I get, without asking for permission) and I should end the relationship. 

She is coming back soon and won't stop texting me about how she can't wait to be back and see me. Says she can't stand her family a day more. 

And a little extra she recently got in a big fight with her best friend and haven't talked to her for over a month.

I'm not comfortable with the idea of breaking up via text message or anything alike, I'm definitely waiting for her to be back to have a proper closure. The problem here is that I don't know if I should wait a few days before ending things up or just go right ahead and tell her that moment she is back. 

I mean she is a great girl, the last thing I want to do is hurt her, yet I have to also look out after my self and what I want for my future.

Back in 2013 I was able to acquire a car that I had always dreamed of owning, a Nissan 350 Z to be exact. In 2016 one year before she and I got together I unfortunately lost that car in a wreck thanks to a drunk driver. Before my 350 Z was totaled that car was my whole world, my baby it became a very passionate hobby of mine and losing her in that accident felt like losing a family member. 

I‚Äôve told my girlfriend about my old car she‚Äôs seen lots of pictures of it and I told her tons of stories about how much fun I used to have driving it. My finances have also greatly improved and I make three times as much money as I did before and I can easily buy another 350 Z two or three times over. I‚Äôve seen a few pop up for sale here and there but my girlfriend always says ‚Äúyou need to forget about it and move on‚Äú and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt waste your money it‚Äôs just a car‚Äú

Currently I‚Äôm driving a Nissan Altima which is fine and it does everything that I need it to do, and I would keep that car as I use it to drive for Uber and Lyft. But I want something I can take out on the road and go on little trips with my girlfriend coming along with me of course.  I really want to buy another one because I miss my 350Z THAT MUCH

basically she is offering me a chance with her for things to work out properly this time and now my head is super confused!! 

i dont know what to do my heart is telling me to go for this girl because she is the one that gives me butterflies shes the one that i can almost feel the sparks flying when we catch each others eye sometimes, shes in my friend group, shes beautiful shes funny shes smart and we have so much in common that it almost seems crazy it didnt work out the first time for us.

now when i really think about as nice as the date was with tinder girl was and how nice and cute she is i dont have that same feeling with her and ive only seen her the once and other than that we just whatsapp and i dont have that same burning desire or visions of the future with her

what should i do? should i throw caution to the wind and go back to the girl i truly want to be with even though it feels like im just being a mug but if she truly means what she says it would make me the happiest man ever! or should i not give her the chance and see if things work out with tinder girl?

Often many misconstrue the meaning of love with superficial feelings or biological signals they pick up on.

it's been quite some time that the title's condition has been true, sadly last month we had a fight (not related to her going out) and her ""going out"" increased a lot to a point that in 1 month we spent together(excluding lunch, dinner, breakfast, sleep) something like around 10 to 15 hours and these hours were not even quality time spent together, probably a lot of it was spent arguing.

&amp;#x200B;

What makes me sad and mad is that she doesn't want me to join her when she goes out with her friends, so as this got really bad I don't see a point in continuing this 10 year marriage if we don't spend time together, because we are just becoming two persons who split bills and share a bed.

# who are we(these might help you understand the situation)?

* we are from italy, so there aren't cultural restrictions that would make my wife ""going out alone"" unacceptable (just tought that this was useful here).
* I am a nerd (computers, videogames, cosplay, anime, hero movies etc...), she's not (likes parties, disco, pop culture, gossip magazines, celebrities etc...), so it's hard to find something that we like together, still in the past we managed to do things together but as the time went by we just decreased more and more our ""shared time"".
* she is very good looking, I am the ""big fat nerd"" (I do take care of my  hygiene), I'm tall and big so proportially it doesn't look that I weight so much, people are always surprised when I tell them my weight, so I guess this does contribute...
* I don't have much friends, I do participate in two ""social circles"" of board games, do have friends that I play online with and meet together outside, but indeed I do not have much friends
* I trust her to not be cheating on me, and she does trust me to not cheat on her, but other than this kind of trust it looks like we don't trust each other anymore on basic things

# what happened

right after the fight 1 month ago she started going out a lot, she went out like 4  times a week (comes back at 2-4 o'clock in the morning, or just goes out and comes back late at night), in the first week I tried to do the same, and it felt old quickly, not because I didn't enjoy my friend's company, but because I missed her, so I just stopped doing like she is doing it and spent more time at home while she went out like crazy, every time I asked if I could join her it started a fight example:

* her: ""I'm going out with X,Y,Z""
* me: ""can I come with you?""
* her: ""no, because the car is full etc..""
* me: ""can I join you my our second card then?""
* her: ""no, because I am with my friends, why would you want to join? you don't know them etc..""
* me: ""how can I get to know them if I don't go out with them?""
* fight... and repeat the next day

# what I tried to suggest

since we are in this situation where we are not spending time together, I asked her to give me a chance, to get me together with her and her friends so I could show that I'm not as bad as she says, I also said that to be happy I need to spend time together with her otherwise it doesn't make sense to continue.

# The reasons why I think she doesn't want to go out with me

* I am very rational
* I'm overweight (130kg, 185cm)
* she says that I am boring and that I ""make her feel shame"" when I'm with her
   * I do work, and I do need to work in a team, so I'm at least good enough with people to get work done and don't create unnecessary drama, obviously mistakes happen but not as much as she says that I do ""socially"" otherwise I wouldn't have a job
* I don't dress well (she works in a worldwide major company that sells retail ""not expensive"" clothes)
   * I'm not totally awkward, I do have a job so at least I'm decent enough to not raise concern at work
   * I do like colors, but obviously I don't use strange stuff
   * I try to be as basic as possible (t-shirt and jeans/cotton bermudas) or t-shirt and jeans.

She's lied to me about not talking to her ex. She cheated on me last year with him. They've continued to talk here and there since. Most recently, as of last week, I found that she was casually talking about meeting up with him some day for a drink and she said something like she can't let her old habits die, meaning they'd most likely have sex. That they have a lot of unfinished business, she says. She swore to me when I called her out on who I thought was him, that it wasn't him she was messaging. 

I know this seems so obvious on what I should do. What's holding me back is guilt over leaving her and her kids (her's from a prior marriage that she gets half the time), and the love I have for her. I'm thinking of leaving her a letter on why I've left and what's going to happen. We have an apartment together that I intend to see about going month to month and I don't mind paying that for a few months for her while she saves for a place. Confronting her in the past hasn't worked as she's lied and manipulated me. All my friends and family say to leave her. 

Any advice?

380,cajx72,roboticanimal11,Will Romantic Redemption Work? (M17) (F17),"My lovely intellectuals of Reddit have come to a predicament in my life and could use some help.

For context

A couple days ago i meet up with a girl i know through an old friend lets call her Carly. She invited me to a house party and to spend the night there. She said her friend was house sitting for a family and there would be booze, she told me to come at 11. Me being me of course i said ""yes"" sounded like a fun opportunity to meet new people and catch up with Carly. She gets to the house and tells me to come i show about in about 10 minutes and tell her im out side she comes out and walks me inside and introduces me to the 2 other people there at the time. i say hi and i get along with the two other girls relative easy with my sarcastic and joking humor (i'm not trying to blow my self off to much). me and Carly get along really well because are sense of humor is very similar we play beer pong and we lost but just barely and the rest of the night goes as followed. im interested in how nice the guest room is so me and Carly walk up there to check it out im exhausted because by this time its about 1AM i lay on the bed and she lays with me we end up talking and laughing with each other for a bit then i lay on stomach to look at my phone she then she kisses me on the cheek. Im shocked and kinda just ignore it then she says ""oh really your not going to make a move."". I turn to her and legit the words that came out of my mouth where ""gentleman dont kiss on the first date."". Me being sarcastic bitch i am of course i say that. carly laughs and says oh really thats a stupid rule, she then hops on to say her friend (my old gf) said i was a bad kisser. i turn to her and say oh really coming from 2 different guys says my ex is a bad kisser. she says well we will never know, i scoff and say ""sure."". She then says ""well we will have to know if we are good kissers if we should not hangout again or should hang out again."". We both look at each other and laugh. the topic switches and we end up just messing around and talking more about stupid stuff. (i have to head home at around 3AM and i set an alarm). about 20 minutes of the changed subject we end up bringing it up again and I finally was like alright sure whatever lets go. we stand up i put on chap stick and she puts some on we make out we move to the bed and talk/makeout till 330. (we both are virgins and i didnt want to lose my vcard and she didnt want to lose her virginity yet ether). she walks me out we kiss goodbye and plan to do something tomorrow great right awesome things are going well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next day i pick her up she grabs dutch i get water. we head to a apartment complex that has an nice open lounging room with comfortable couches and big TVs. we end up snuggling and watching a movie all is well we are messing around making fun of each other, the usual and making fun of the movie as well. After its over we put on another one i asked her if she wanted to go home she said no. we arent really watching this second movie and are just kinda playing that touchy feely shit like 12 year olds, we kiss again but not really any making out like the other night.... and here we go what you've been waiting for how in the fuck could i possibly screw this up. my dumb ass had a brain fart and i i accidentally called her Celia (we will used that as and example) and ""Carly"" ""turns to me and says ""my name isn't Celia is Carly."". the fire in her eyes said it all i said ""oh shit im sorry i dont know why i said that i have never talked to Celia before or dated one."". She then says ""ok you can take me home now."". (nice going idiot you really did fuck this up). also me panicking when she stared to walk away i snapped my fingers for some reason idk got anxious i guess im usually pretty much in control of the situation and it was starting to spiral down hill really fast. she didn't like that for obvious reasons making her more man, i end up driving her home and apologies when i step out of the car to say goodbye she then says ""i know your sorry but it doesn't mean i have to forgive you."". I then turn away to walk back to my car and i say ""ya thats fair."". and nod my head up and down in a sarcastic, thinking manner if you know what i mean. and drive home.

&amp;#x200B;

my question is i let it sit for a couple days to let her think about it, and i have a plan to maybe let her know im serious about the whole celia thing and that it was an honest mistake. By her side of the story i can see where shes coming from her last bf which when they broke up was about 3 weeks ago. supposedly her ex cheated on her and if thats the case i can see why she would be mad at me calling her the wrong name (like im talking to another girl named celia) and or i was a fall back she just need the right reason to end things with me and she saw the opportunity to. (ive been a fall back before and im pretty sure thats not it things are a lot different with me and her so i rule out the second option.). so i have a ""romantic"" plan to show i mean what i said when i said i was sorry to win her back per say. know that sense im typing it i sound like and absolute lunatic to think that its a good idea!!! but do you guys think it would work? or should i just throw in the towel. i usually can decide what to do but the opinions lately have been pretty straight froward that i should move on but im tired of giving up so easy ive just done it so many times before you feel or is that just how the cookie crumbles? anyway its a fun story to tell and writing it out helps me break things down so tell me what you think i should do?

382,cajv10,snoitol,My brother skipped a test in college and has to repeat a whole year cz of it. My father thinks he gave the test and failed.,"My elder brother(age 20) has back and mental health issues due to which he missed a lot of classes and even some of his finals exams. Due to the low attendance, he was debarred from giving some of the other exams. All of this combined meant that he would've had to repeat a whole year. 

Well, my father talked with some of his teachers and they agreed he could take a re-test for the exams he missed. It was just enough for him to not repeat the whole year. 

My brother gave all the re-tests but slept through one of the practical re-tests (he lives on-campus). He was too scared to tell our father and stressing him so he lied and told him he gave the exam. 

Now, his results are out and naturally he has to repeat the year. His result says he was 'Absent' in the said exam. He says its because he was eventually debarred from that subject too. Dad wants to meet the teacher but brother won't let him. He says its of no use.

When he had told me about it, I thought he would own up after the results came out but now I don't know what to do. I would tell my father but that would destroy my relationship with my brother (which isn't great to begin with) and he really needs someone to confide in given his mental health.",2019-07-08 11:29:39,8,1,relationship_advice
383,cajv0g,Froggsworth,Me (18M) and my (18F) girlfriend in a giant rough spot and now on break.,"Before I start I just want to say that this girl is the best thing that has ever happened to me and I love her more than anything. 

So starting out, recently shes been talking about breaking up because she doesn't feel she can be in a relationship and doesn't feel it's fair to me that she cant commit to this. Shes super stressed and has so much going on with chronic pains and chronic migraines. All I want to do is help her through it and show her I care about her and am willing to support her no matter what.

On Friday morning, she said shes ending it and I brought her the stuff she gave me over the period of the relationship, and she broke down and said she didn't want me to go and said she wanted my help with her problems and loves me more than anything. But then later in the day she looked really down and I asked her about it and she said she'd been thinking and she really can't do it anymore and told me to go home. 

Saturday  morning, I went over to her house and tried my best to convince her and took the stuff she gave me back since she said me giving it back showed i didn't appreciate her work she put into it, which I do appreciate it, I appreciate her. She started breaking down slowly and told me to leave again and i told her if she changed her mind to text me or give me a call.

Later over the day I was texting to check up on her and then out of the blue she texted me to come over and I didn't say anything I just went and when I got there, she jumped into my arms and was hugging me and kissing my neck and I carried her inside and we sat down and we both told each other ""I'm home"" since home is where the heart is. She was happy and smiling that I was there, snuggling on me and holding my hand whenever she could.

She took me to barnes and noble and she bought herself a onesie she was always eyeing and she was smiling so hard and kissed me. We then went to the mall and she was walking around in the onesie and was just smiling and holding onto me.  She gave me a tour of the mall since I've never really been around. Then we went to Walmart to get something for her mom and I went to ask a question of where something was when an announcement came on and she ran to me saying she didn't know what was up and ran to me for protection. 

We got back to her house and she was cuddling with me and making out with me and told me she didn't care if her dad caught us making out saying all she wanted was me.

So yesterday morning, I went over there to see her before packing and leaving for college orientation. She woke up and didn't want to see me and said she was confused and was just lonely and I was the only one she could rely on and close by. She said she was lost and confused and didn't know what to do with her life. I told her I was the same way. 

We kept talking and she said she needed a break and during the time I'm at orientation, we'll be on break. She said she just cant do this anymore and I told her she can and she hugged me really hard and we started kissing and hugging. She was smiling and didn't want me to leave. She told me she loves me. I just dont know what to do.

Tldr: me and girlfriend on breaking point and shes super confused about everything and doesn't want to be in a relationship saying she can't handle and that's it's not fair to me",2019-07-08 11:29:34,20,1,relationship_advice
384,cajs2u,Ninenineteen19,"I need to talk through my (28M) relationship with (28F) with a neutral party. I don‚Äôt know whether to feel sympathy, whether it‚Äôs worth trying anymore, or if I‚Äôm responsible for any of it.","

I‚Äôve known Marie since 2010, when she dated my college friend. There was always an attraction, but obviously not something I‚Äôd act on. I‚Äôve only seen this friend 3 or 4 times total since then. But in the last year or two, I started seeing Marie around town more. Her and the ex dated again 2 years ago too. Anyway, I was playing music at a bar in December and she walks in. We agree to hang out on New Year‚Äôs Eve. things go like you‚Äôd expect, however I‚Äôd expressed my hesitation due to my friend/her ex. We have a good night but she says ‚Äúif we fuck, you cant tell him.‚Äù 

And so we go forward this way, with her saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not looking for anything serious.‚Äù But we start hanging out essentially every day, having sex constantly and behaving as bf and gf. I initially maintain my hesitation towards a and serious relationship. And she does too, but her actions don‚Äôt show it and she often talks about not wanting to see other people (I didn‚Äôt want to either - I cut off other girls. We were kidding ourselves with the casual thing.) and she asks me on a vacation around a month into it. I decline, citing work reasons, which was half legit. But we continue to get closer. Eventually, I‚Äôll admit it, I started to sense her pulling away just a tad. I realized I needed to make my feelings clear and that she deserved this from me. She should know that I like her a lot, am not seeing anyone else, and am into this. So I did. This was 2 months in. She says she still doesn‚Äôt want a relationship yet, but I‚Äôm bf material and we are trending that way. And furthermore, she says unprompted that she isn‚Äôt seeing anyone else and would tell me if she was. things are great for a while.

So, a bit more about Marie. She is bipolar and depressed and it was my feeling that this factored heavily into her behavior. We drank more than I‚Äôve ever drank before and when she mixed alcohol with Prozac, she was extremely unpredictable. She‚Äôd tell me she loved me and things like that and generally keep me up all night doing weird stuff. I routinely stayed up til 4 in the morning before work. Or I‚Äôd wake up in the middle of the night and she‚Äôd be gone. These things though, I could deal with as some were my fault. And because we had fun, the sex was fantastic, We loved the same things, And she‚Äôs smart, beautiful and funny and I felt happy in the good times. I started to think of her as a girlfriend, even though I knew I had the hurdle of telling my old friend (who it turned out, had been a heroin addict and had broken into her house and still drives by and all this shit). 

But then she was at the bar one night and asked me to come pick her up. She was blackout and when I got her home, she took her clothes off and got mad when I wouldn‚Äôt fuck her. she started saying I was ‚Äúso shitty‚Äù and to go fuck myself and was mad that I wouldn‚Äôt let her go back to the bar. Then she accused me of taking her somewhere against her will when she realized she didn‚Äôt have her car, which was scary. the following day, my friend told me that before I‚Äôd gotten there, she tried to take another friend home. So I told her about it, thinking I might break it off. She started bawling, saying she can‚Äôt believe she said those things, that I‚Äôve never once been shitty to her and that she resents herself for ruining relationships before they start. She also said that she was sorry about the guy and that she doesn‚Äôt even like him, but alcohol and Prozac turns her into a demon. So I kept going tentatively, but before long I was right back in it. But she was oddly withdrawn at times, at a time when I felt like I was trying. 2 weeks later, it happened again but worse. More verbal abuse (‚ÄúI hate you‚Äù and bossing me around/shushing me), she bit me until I bled, tried to take my belt off and when I said no, pushed me. She said my hat was stupid and tried to kick it off of my head and in doing so, kicked me extremely hard in the jaw. She was telling me to give her bruises. When I refused, she said ‚Äúthen you aren‚Äôt worth it.‚Äù And I found out that she had been seeing a girl behind my back. in the car that night, she declined 6 calls from a name I didn‚Äôt recognize. I asked her about it but she was too out of it. Obviously I was curious. So we go inside and when all that shit was happening, she left her phone sitting there open and it was her saying ‚ÄúI want to fuck you‚Äù to this girl. I could have gone through her phone, but I only scrolled up that message just enough to confirm that this was an ongoing dynamic and not a random drunk text to an ex or something. And suddenly all those times she went to see ‚Äúfriends‚Äù in the city made sense. And that when she pulled away, she was really just seeing this girl. So I broke up with because we had an agreement and this had been over three months. Plus, she had assaulted me. To make things worse, when I tried to ask her about it, she said she wouldn‚Äôt meet up or talk on the phone and she made me do it by text. She said it‚Äôs for the best and that she never deserved my help, she‚Äôs poisoned on the inside, etc. 

A week later, we hung out for my birthday (she bartends at the place I frequent and so we just randomly see each other). Since then, 2.5 months ago, we have had an on and off dynamic where we‚Äôll spend a whole weekend together just like old times and then we‚Äôll barely speak for a few days. And this is hard for me because I really have feelings for her and I miss her when she‚Äôs gone. It‚Äôs very stressful. 

But it‚Äôs been that long! And like the other day, she came into the bar with a group of people, including a guy who was clearly interested in her. I said ‚Äúhey, just so I know, are you and that guy a thing? I‚Äôm not mad but I can‚Äôt be here for that.‚Äù And she said no. And her and I went home that night, though we were hiding it from that guy for some reason. We sometimes talk about things but I don‚Äôt think she remembers it because of us drinking and we did this night. She said that it bothers her that I seem to like her more when someone else shows interest and I was very very taken aback, because it isn‚Äôt true. I think of her all the time and have made this clear. But given that while we still had that agreement, she tried to go home with that mutual friend multiple times and another time post breakup, I took her to the bar after spending the night together and she got blackout and tried to take another friend home in front of me and it just made me feel...idk. You get it. I mean I didn‚Äôt even list all the drunk incidents, just the worst two. But because she said that and she says I used to not text her back fast enough or was hesitant to move fast or go on vacation at first, it makes me feel like I should try harder to see her or like it‚Äôs my own fault on some level that she started withdrawing. So recently even after everything, I‚Äôve gone out of my way to invite her to things, text her, etc. but often she hasn‚Äôt even replied. So I can‚Äôt read her and I don‚Äôt know how to act at all. Sometimes she asks me to hold her. But on the same night, she‚Äôll be rude in response to a compliment. I had given up and not reached out for a week, but Yesterday I saw her and we kissed and made tentative plans for tonight and she ended up bailing. 

Am I fucking stupid? It‚Äôs hard to explain. But I miss her and in the moment, I decide that I want to see her again, and I never say no. I yearn for the good times. But I‚Äôm always caught between that and being mad about what she did. So I just find myself existing in a weird pseudo relationship and now I wonder that comes off to her like I don‚Äôt actually care for her...when really I‚Äôm over here thinking that she doesn‚Äôt give a shit about me and struggling badly from what has happened and parsing through wildly mixed signals that make me feel like I‚Äôm neglectful one second and then overly needy the next. 

TLDR:

I‚Äôve been struggling through this relationship and I don‚Äôt even think she knows the extent of how it affects me. I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs enough left there to bother trying but I‚Äôm still torn up about it. Maybe I should just try and help her, but it‚Äôs like she won‚Äôt let me sometimes.",2019-07-08 11:20:28,20,5,relationship_advice

What can me [19f] and my Mum do to get through to him that he needs to use protection?,"I‚Äôm fairly close with my brother, and He‚Äôs only just started being open about his relationships and love life and stuff with me in the last year. I‚Äôm really grateful that he trusts me enough to talk about it with me, because he doesn‚Äôt talk much about it with my Mum which is fair enough. 

We were having a conversation a couple of months ago and he told me he‚Äôs slept with 10 people apparently, and hasn‚Äôt been using protection. He said that he waits until he visits my Dad‚Äôs house (once a week/fortnight for a few days) then goes out to girls houses because my Dad doesn‚Äôt care what he does. I was so angry and worried about him, and I was even more concerned about the girls he‚Äôs sleeping with. I told him that even though these girls might be on the pill or whatever you can still get STI‚Äôs, and it was really irresponsible of him to go sleeping around especially if he wasn‚Äôt sure he was clean.

I convinced him to go to a local sex clinic to get a check up and STI test and it came back clean, but he‚Äôs still not using protection. 

I feel that my Mum is very open about sex and stuff with him, because she knows he does it but she assumed that he was using protection. She‚Äôs bought a couple packets of condoms apparently and left them in his room and not said anything. I think that she can be too open about it though and that makes him not want to go into it even more than he already does with her. 

My cousin, who my brother is close with, found out recently he has herpes. I think they‚Äôve briefly talked about it together and my Mum and brother have discussed how it‚Äôs for life and all that, and he is still not using protection. 

I‚Äôm really concerned about him catching something that‚Äôs untreatable, or even worse spreading it around. It‚Äôs hard to do many effective or productive things or keep an eye on him because I live in a different town.

Currently 6 months in with a great man. Ambitious, funny, sweet, etc., but a serious problem is beginning to push me towards ending it. He's not in denial, but at same time hasn't taken any real action. 

&amp;#x200B;

Situation: He typically drinks 2 tall cans and the large 40 oz bottle of beer just about everyday of every weekend (as far as I know) to ""help him sleep"" and/or relax since it's the weekend. Although I have only been with him for about 6 months, I have already come to notice a definite pattern during my stays with him on weekends. In my opinion, he's already good enough to sleep after the first can or can and a half as he: begins to respond slower, begins to not make too much sense, begins to loose balance when walking/standing, and definitely after the second can/bottle slurred speech. Although it doesn't interfere with day to day activities, his job, or his ambition to get to where he wants to be career-wise (at the moment) it has become a problem for our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm realizing that this is definitely not something I can live with or at least have in my life. Just about every time he's gotten that way, the night almost never ends well. I feel like I loose him every time he is this way, like he's not even there. I have brought this up with him a few times, to which he said he understands and he'll cut down and not drink when I sleep over. I can't speak for during the week since i'm not with him, but the no drinking park when I stay over didn't last long, unfortunately.... He admits he has a problem, agrees he's overly reliant on beer, and has said he should seek help. But, at the same time would try to justify the habit by saying it's because he's been doing it for \~5yrs already. 

&amp;#x200B;

SO, I guess what I'm asking is, what do I even do? How can I help?

We then started talking on snapchat, WhatsApp and had a few phone calls. In all honesty I didn't find him that attractive, but he was quite funny so I decided to look past his looks. Well he used to do stuff like block me for one day then unblock me again, and for some odd reason I never deleted him after him doing this. He made fun of my looks in one throwback picture from my early teen years then refused to apologise. Again I don't know why I didn't delete him, I think I was just focusing on his nice moments because sometimes if I called him to vent about something he would be a good listener. For two years he kept trying to meet me and I would always have excuses or blow him off. 

During this time I would just talk to and see other guys instead and I had one on my Snapchat story. He never really got the hint and kept trying to meet me. One day I replied to his snap story after we hadn't spoken for a while, and he talked about how he was thinking ""what have I done to this girl"". I told him something traumatic happened to me where an ex had committed identity theft and fraud against me (that's all sorted now) so I didn't really want to date any guys for a while and he said ok I understand why you didn't want to meet me now, that he's a nice guy and I should give him a chance, then I told him even if that didn't happen I wouldn't have gone to meet him anyway, after you refused to apologise to me for the rude thing you said. He then apologised and I guess I just forgave him. About a week later or so, I was feeling bad about never going to meet him when he had been wanting to for years and had told me that he would be going back to his old town after uni, so I offered to visit him. 

When I went to visit him, he was rude, cold and hostile from the first moment. He made a comment about how I had lost loads of weight (I had lost 15lbs from the stress with my ex) and was really unfriendly. He was on his phone most of the time when I was talking to him, ignoring me, and was very curt. I hate myself for not deciding to leave early when I picked up on this, and I will never understand why I didn't leave. He told me that he had to go to bed in such a rude way and then I got an Uber back home. I'm just not understanding why he had to be so nasty when he had been trying all this time to meet me. The next day he told me he wasn't feeling me like that, when I asked him why he said I only speak to people with certain vibes. I'm very mad at myself that I did not delete him after our encounter. Why was he so hostile?",2019-07-08 11:06:46,4,0,relationship_advice

390,cajnd7,HourThing2,I am no longer sexually attracted to my girlfriend,"Me (30/m) and my SO (24/f) have been in a relationship for about 16 months of which we live together for about 15 months. She is pretty, skinny, fit, doesn't have bad habits, we don't fight, she likes everything about me. If I had to describe a perfect girlfriend, she would be very close to it. Before her I was in the tinder dating pool for a few years (she wasn't, we met at an event) and she is by far the best of all the girls I met over this period of time (\~15-20 dates). In other words, I doubt that I could do any better than her if I started from scratch. First 6 months no problems at all. About a year in I catch myself to a thought that I don't want to have sex with her and since then it is all downhill in the bedroom, all the sexual attraction just fades out more and more. I just don't feel sexually attracted to her. I can do the deed, but it usually takes quite some time to finish (for me). Maybe that is also contributing to problem, as I don't want to have sex if I know that it will be hard to finish. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although I'm her first relationship, I get everything I want whenever I want very easy. I don't have to woo her. She is so into me that I don't have to put in any effort. We spend almost all time together, only me-time I get is during work hours or when she is out for something. She doesn't have much interests, we don't chat throughout the day and she doesn't have much to talk about when we are together (I'm chatty katty). This would be her biggest flaw, but as I'm introverted, I understand that and her great attitude towards me makes up for all of that.   


I don't want to hold her back, she should be with someone who desires her. But it is her choice to be with me and she seems to be genuinely happy to be with me (only that I don't desire her as I should, that makes her sad). She hasn't said anything to me about lack of sex, although we both understand that I have some issues. And I think there is very low chance I could do any better than her long term relationship wise. I wouldn't want to break up, broke her heart and after some 6 months realize I do want her and beg for her to comeback. Or end up in same situation in a relationship with another person. It is a popular myth that woman loses interest in sex, head ""hurts"", tired etc and the man has to earn the sex, birthday sex and things like that. Only this time I ended up as the woman who is always ""tired"" to do anything in bed...  


What to do? Is lack of sexual desire enough to break up?",2019-07-08 11:05:13,57,47,relationship_advice
391,cajlys,detapat,[24M]I'm suspicious about my girlfriends [29F] instagram activity,"Hey Reddit! Throwaway because reasons.

I've confronted my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago about her instagram notifications being turned off. 

She said they were always like that (true) and there's nothing I should be worried about. Well, that didn't work, I started to worry about it and we had some fights on the subject. I started to look for her online status (I know it's not a good and healthy habbit) and when I asked why she's always online on instagram, she turned of her last active timestamp so I couldn't see it anymore (she turned it back on after a couple of days). The reason was that she wanted to see how long I can abstain myself from asking her why she turned it off. I feel like everything she does, is to make me mad and crazy about it. She doesn't have any schedule outside  her work one and we usually see eachother everyday. 

A bit of history:

We have a couple of years between us, she's 5 years older than me and never had any major fights. We get along very well but first time I've confronted her about instagram and had a fight about it, she said that our relationship is not like it used to be, that there's no passion between us and we act like two best friends. We both cried, thinking it was all over, but the next day we continued like nothing happened. But the things we said to eachother were true. 


After a couple of days I saw that she activated her instagram notifications, all except the message ones. After about a week, I've confronted her about this too and again, she said there's nothing to worry about and if I can't trust her on this, we're better of alone because she's too tired of not being trusted and always explaining me that I should not worry about. 

I can understand myself being too obsessed with the subject but I don't understand her lack of transparency. She also told me that if I was more delicate on the subject (meaning that I was too accusatory when confronted her), she would've shown me her instagram messages, but now she won't show me anything just because of that. On top of everything, she deactivated her last active timestamp again. I trust her, always trusted her, she NEVER gave me ANY reason to be suspicious about her except this one. Instead of being more transparent about it, she does everything to make me more suspicious. 

I feel that she's hiding something or wants me to drive me crazy. 

I'm stressed, can't think and don't know what to do. Am I the crazy one? Am I a jerk for asking her all this? Am I the only one who finds this suspicious?


EDIT: Apparently the problem is with me. I don't know if previous unlucky experiences made me this way, but I want to change the way I behave myself then. I don't see myself as other people are seeing me. I think I need specialized help because I feel I'm going crazy.",2019-07-08 11:00:42,19,7,relationship_advice
392,cajl1m,throwawayamo1,My family is pissed off that I (21M) am taking up work experience at my misogynistic uncle's (60M) business?,"So I (21M) have finished college and need some work experience. Now I need to provide some context.

I have two sisters (23F and 25F), one brother (18M) and my two parents are 55M and 55F. My parents are both school teachers and ardent feminists/activists. My uncle (dad's brother) is 60 years old and the eldest of three brothers. He's also extremely wealthy, we're talking multi-millions. He has his own business which he started a long time ago. I'd guess his net worth is something like $30 million.

He's also an asshole. He's the typical ''Alpha male bro'' stereotype, except he's 60 and not a young guy. A compilation of things he's said:

- ''Women love some good dick; without it they'll cause hassle, but give them some good dick and they'll shut up''

- ''Feminism is cancer''

- ''I'm an Alpha male. A dominant guy. I was born to be great''

- Dunno if it's worth mentioning but his current wife is 25 years old. This is not to mention the fact that he has a kid with another woman who he abandoned and pays minimum child support for, he keeps referring to that kid as a ''little shit'' that he wants nothing to do with (kid is still infant)

He's said a lot of other shit, but he's pushy, misogynistic, rude and arrogant. **He's like a cartoon character.** However, he's a good businessman. My father doesn't like him for obvious reasons, but he used to push my dad around too. He said to him ''You're bitter because you're a failure schoolteacher. You'll never be as great as me''. I think it irks my father too that his parents (my grandparents) see my uncle as the 'great success' of their three sons. 

Well my uncle dropped by to visit and said he wanted to speak with me. My mom was confused but he sat me aside and told me that he knows I've finished college, and that how I would I like it if I underwent 3 months work experience with him. I was really surprised when he said that, firstly because I've never been that close to him, but secondly because I never envisioned such an opportunity could arise. This would be amazing for my resume. My mother was going to butt in and talk on my behalf but I instantly said yes and he looked pleased. Well after he left my mom was pissed.

She called my dad and they both said that if I go through working for him, that I'd be ''disappointing them'' massively and condoning misogyny. My two sisters also said I shouldn't do it and called me a ''fucking horrible person'' if I do it. My dad said that he could get me work experience at the school he teaches at, but there's just no fucking way I want to work at a school over this. I told them that I don't condone my uncle's behavior but this opportunity would help open doors for me. My brother said ''fuck all this noise and just go do the work its a good experience''.

So, how do I move forward with my family?",2019-07-08 10:57:38,9,0,relationship_advice
393,cajl0e,ohlolthisisrandom,I like girl who has a bf almost 10 years older than her,"The story is pretty much as the title explains it.

&amp;#x200B;

I \[M22\] have started liking this girl \[F19\] who works with me. We seem to hit it off great. We kinda just stand there and talk about things other than work, sometimes work too. We havent really seen each other outside of work yet, but as we go to the same university, its quite easy to make plans to meet up after the uni break is over. I have started to like her quite a bit and have started to develop feelings for her.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that she has a boyfriend, i dont know his exact age but he is roughly 10 years older than the girl. The fact that she has a bf should make me back off but for some reason, it doesnt feel right to. I knew she had a bf from the beginning and that didnt make a difference to me because I took her as just another co-worker. But as we spent more time together, I really started liking her. I havent met someone like her before and she is pretty much what i've been looking for.

&amp;#x200B;

The question is: what the hell do i do? I like her quite a bit, and the more time i spend with her, the more time i wanna spend with her. I feel this is like a story with most guys but I havent been in this situation before, its usually been quite straight forward for in terms of dating so im a little confused as to what to do here. It kinda seems immoral to go for her but i also feel that giving up isnt really the right thing to do.",2019-07-08 10:57:30,5,0,relationship_advice

395,cajg0d,thecommongal,How to know when it‚Äôs time to call it quits or keep going?,"I‚Äôm (24f), my bf is (27m). 

We have been together for 10 months. He was my middle and high school crush. 

We both have strong minded/ loud spoken personalities and like to debate, but honestly it‚Äôs to the point we just argue A LOT. And it‚Äôs getting pretty annoying. 
I always speak up when something is on my mind, so does he. So we clash when that happens.

We have very different lifestyle habits; I like to sleep with the AC on, he just wants a fan. 
I am a very difficult sleeper, I need pitch black and the white noise. He likes it silent.
He likes to be cheap in life; I don‚Äôt.
He likes to play the manipulative victim and then ANYTHING I‚Äôm upset with back onto me.

He also doesn‚Äôt have a job... has been unemployed almost the whole relationship. So it has been a burden on me to help out. He‚Äôs never asked for money which is good but still. Having all of the financial burden is slowly making me resent him and then in return I start getting annoyed easily. It‚Äôs messed up I know, but I didn‚Äôt purposely sign up to help someone be unemployed for this long. I have found jobs he can take and he doesn‚Äôt want it.

It sucks because we have strong chemistry for sure, he‚Äôs a great guy. I do have love for him. 
But god all we do is fight and it‚Äôs just really wearing on me. 

He‚Äôs constantly up my ass about who I‚Äôm texting and what I‚Äôm doing on my phone as well. I‚Äôve never given a reason for him to ever doubt me / distrust what I‚Äôd be doing. So that‚Äôs also annoying to me.

397,cajegs,Valienty,Girl I like that I think is leading me on.,"I have posted about this girl before.

The girl that went out once with me once only to flake everytime after. As a result I gave her a call to let her know of my intentions to see if she'd be interested or not, it turns out she had just gotten out of a relationship and we had agreed we can go out to get to know each other. for the next few times, she also flaked again.

&amp;#x200B;

The last time which was 2 weeks ago, she apologized and said im an asshole im sorry, I'm not doing all this intentionally, I've been super busy, bla bla bla. Honestly, at that point I just told her it's cool, good luck with the exam you studying for, and was kind of cold.

&amp;#x200B;

She started interacting more on my posts on FB, Instagram. Last Wednesday she randomly texted me asking me if i'd be willing to join her and her/our friends for Sushi. I Declined, saying I had plans already, and that we have bad timing. she said hahah yes we do, and made small talk and that's that.

&amp;#x200B;

Just yesterday she out of office but left her notebook, my friend and I decided to draw some cartoons on it, as he was done, she entered and saw me drawing mine so she was joking about it and said it is so nice but small, can you do another big one in the next page? I said cool, she was very interested, complimented me, asked me how my interviews were, them I let her ink the drawing and that was that.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I think she is just being friendly, but wants to string me along as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Never had she said she isn't interested or something, she'd always flake with an excuse and last time she said ""This is not intentional, im not doing this on purpose to piss you off or something"" She is just leading me on, isn't she?",2019-07-08 10:35:18,9,1,relationship_advice
398,cajeby,cory334,Why can‚Äôt I just move on from someone who treated me so badly,"So this girl I was seeing really treated me just terribly. 

We communicated by text for months, so the connection was always there from the start of actual dating. She always wanted to go on a date with me. Asked me weekly (lived away from home so couldn‚Äôt get back). 

Finally go and it‚Äôs a great date. We stay out all night and even go back to hers. She then tells me she ‚Äòdoesn‚Äôt think she wants a bf‚Äô. After sex so yeah thanks for getting me hooked before telling me this, very much not what I was expecting her to say but there we are. I said okay and said I was kinda fine with continuing a bit more casually for now and just seeing where things go after our exams (we both had finals). She said she thought we were on the same page then. 

We continue dating. It gets more and more intimate. She asks me to stay every single time except once, when she said she doesn‚Äôt want me assuming I can stay. Bit confusing but okay. We get closer and closer, we text every day like we always had been. She tells me she‚Äôs ‚Äònever had sexual chemistry like this before‚Äô, that I ‚Äòmake her feel safe‚Äô. That‚Äôs she missed me. She told me all her problems, like about her issues with her ex‚Äôs, told me about her family, wanted me to come to parties with her, told her mum about me. Etc. Only thing was that as soon as it came to my feelings, or my past, she didn‚Äôt care. Didn‚Äôt want to hear it, made me feel a bit like I was putting her off if I talked about it. 

Eventually I come to feel like it‚Äôs becoming more, and now I feel like I at least need to know we are sexually exclusive. There was a slight issue with an STD scare and I couldn‚Äôt continue unless we sorted this out. I asked her and she got extremely defensive. Told me it‚Äôs not what she wants and she‚Äôs not being coerced into doing something she doesn‚Äôt want to. I was never trying to coerce her into anything, I was just trying to come to a compromise with someone I really wanted to continue seeing. But nope it was her way or the highway and she got mad I even tried to change our situation.  She eventually told me she wanted ‚Äòa boyfriend without the commitment‚Äô. 

I was actually quite disturbed by this but I really liked her, so I tried my best. She then asked me for space. I was kinda insulted, yes I was probably texting too much and was getting a little clingy, but I think even the strongest of people would start to when they were so confused. I eventually brought it up again and she got extremely angry. I tried to be calm and just discuss it and she said ‚Äòall you do is talk about my feelings for you and it‚Äôs really irritating‚Äô. She then told me my texts ‚Äòmade her angry‚Äô and I was ‚Äòobsessed‚Äô and then told me she didn‚Äôt want a relationship when I said I felt like things might change after exams. I told her that‚Äôs fine but she wouldn‚Äôt hear from me again as I was pretty hurt. 

I did text her again, apologising and trying to be friendly but she just ignored me. I never heard from her again. 

I‚Äôm really struggling to understand what happened. I‚Äôve realised that the way she treated me was actually pretty abusive. But for some reason I still really want her. I‚Äôm a bit emotionally broken by this whole thing. And honestly she doesn‚Äôt have any issues after this. She goes off travelling for the year having the time of her life not even thinking she did anything wrong and I‚Äôm left working a job I really don‚Äôt want to be working because I need the experience and having all these mental issues. 

I just don‚Äôt know what happened. Looking for some advice on how to proceed I guess. It‚Äôs been almost 3 months and I still can‚Äôt stop thinking about her. It‚Äôs all I ever think about. I can‚Äôt get up in the morning or focus on my work at all. 

Need some help. Thanks :)

399,cajd5n,brokenthrowaway___,"Broke up because of ""gut"" feeling and now I am completely messed up","Hello redditors, I had a nice, loving relationship for about 5 years, but last couple of months were kinda hell-ish, I helped her move out from her parents (very abusive family) and that really set her off, became a huge egoist, demanding and had some heavy double standards. 

&amp;#x200B;

Accused me for cheating: she said holding hands with some girl (I was dead drunk at a time and cannot recall a thing) on party and was with her -- later I learned from two friends that literally nothing happened, some girl was trying to flirt me and I did not give a sh\*t. I am more liberal and do put any weight on those sort of thinks (drunk kisses, flirting etc), and she mentioned two times that some drunk guy was cuddling with her but she was afraid to say no because ""he looked shady"", also had a series of serious flirt with some guy on facebook she admitted, and I did not give a lot sh\*t about this, telling me that she is very loyal.  

&amp;#x200B;

Also addressed that I have alcohol problem -- I am weekend drinker and rarely skip, so I got genuinely worried, completely kicked alcohol for 2 months, after that I started counting to realize that I drink 3-5 beers on Fri and Sat and nothing in-between, with maybe 4-5 excesses during that 5 years where I got completely wrecked and blacked out, last few months she was drinking more than me. She often brags that she's not a party type, and tells me that I need to get more serious but she is going out 3-fold more than me (rarely invites me with her friends bc they don't like me, and she does not like my friends at all). 

&amp;#x200B;

\[...\] (can remember like 10 more similar situations)

&amp;#x200B;

During the last week I had a real trouble with this ""gut"" feeling, and was really cold, but could not vocalize or understand what exactly did not work, but something was really off, she barely could talk to me, I started skipping going out with her (we skipped only if there's no way to see each other). At the end, I went completely mute and ignored her (immature I know), but at this moment I literally had no idea what's the problem. She left, offended, and later removed relationship status, I felt relieved.  The very next day I saw another guy dropped her home, but may be a false flag (I believe it's a friend or relative).

  
Was thinking heavily about the situation, sleepless nights to come up to conclusions mentioned above, also feel that this is the only tip of the iceberg. I am not sure if I am skewing the facts and making things up because I'm hurt, but I feel like a completely messed up, manipulated and used, also have some feelings for her, which makes this frenzy amalgam. Thought I went thru everything (four 2+ year relationships and man-whore periods in between), but this totally putting me off guard. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now she will probably have to move back to abusive parents (if they accept her, they went mad when she was moving out) because I was financing everything (she has a very low paid job but I never bothered her to pay because I have good salary, was partially paying her apt too). That also disturbs me a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to think that she is genuinely a good person, but the most of the facts are telling me a different story. I am writing here in order to hear some valuable input from someone unaffected, and with pair of ""fresh eyes"". Thank you in advance, would really mean a lot!  


**TLDR;** Broke up with gf because of ""gut"" feeling, only to feel that I may have been manipulated and used.

401,cajb62,ComplexHighway,I feel so confused and lonely,"I 23 years old, I graduated from university and I feel relieved that it is all over and done with. I hated university, going to university was the worst and toughest experience of my life so far.

I was depressed, suicidal, stressed and anxious the entire time. I never felt comfortable or happy while I was there and I never felt like I was learning anything. I was happy to leave it behind. It wasn‚Äôt all positive but I‚Äôm happy I had the experience.

Today, I don‚Äôt feel depressed anymore but I feel so lonely. I‚Äôm unemployed, I started a masters degree but couldn‚Äôt finish. I‚Äôm now seeing my high school mates getting married and starting their own lives while I‚Äôm sat in my parents home without friends or anything and not knowing what to do.

I‚Äôve signed up to start volunteering and I‚Äôve been thinking of becoming a doctor but the thought makes me feel depressed as most people in my country have graduated from medical school by 23/24 years old because they go straight from high school. I feel lost and confused about who I am in life and where I am going.

I want to get married like my friends from school because it feels like an ‚Äúadult‚Äù thing to do but I don‚Äôt even think I can get married because I have a chronic disease that most guys won‚Äôt want to deal with and it affects my self esteem and how I feel about myself. 

I just feel so alone and it gets worse at night because there is no one around me. I feel left behind when I see people getting married, I‚Äôm behind everyone else and left to play catch up.I didn‚Äôt want my life to turn out like this but I don‚Äôt know what I can do.

TLDR: I (23f) am feeling depressed, lonely and confused. I graduated from university, have failed to get a job. Started a masters degree, couldn‚Äôt finish. Started volunteering at a hospital to pass time but feel so lonely still. I have no friends from university and my friends from high school don‚Äôt talk to me anymore and are all either married or engaged and planning their wedding. I feel left out and depressed because I‚Äôm not married (and nowhere near that).

402,cajab1,1kschmeckles,Should I (26M) fight for her (24F) or should I just wait?,"I had a short (1 month), very intense affair with this girl (although it wasn't supposed to be just an affair). It was truly magical. There was lots of wild sex, chemistry, great memories, and sweet talk. We both fell in love.


All of a sudden, though, and without any apparent reason, she disappeared from my life. Later on I found out she was engaged with a guy, and they're gonna get married soon. It seems this wedding had been planned well in advance, but after meeting me, she had a radical change of heart. However, there's lots of pressure from her religious family and she is trapped.


After a month and a half of no contact at all, due to random circumstances of life, I saw her last week as we had to do some stuff together for 4 days. She was really happy to see me. Great conversation, laughs, jokes, mutual understanding, and lots of kino and sexual tension. She confessed to me she is not happy with that guy, that she is not attracted to him, they barely have sex and when they do, she thinks about me. Apart from that, she is reluctant to talk about him. She doesn't like talking about this.


The last day of our interaction, I asked her out for a coffee. She didn't answer, but her eyes were conveying ""I am dying to say yes, but I can't"". I gave her a serious gaze, said ""okay"", walked away and went home.

""As much as I'd love to be with you, I can't. I want you in my life. I crave to be with you. It was such a pleasure to see you again. You made my heart beat like crazy. You are the master of my heart! But, as I told you last night, I am in a difficult situation. Nonetheless... please don't forget about me. You don't have to do anything. I'll try and make a decision, and if you're single by then, maybe we could have some coffee...""

Twenty minutes later, another text:

""I can't stop thinking about you... this is so hard... please forgive me. If you fall in love with someone else, I will understand. You deserve to be happy and it would be unfair for you to wait for me. Just do what makes you happy... take care of yourself. I love you"".


Two days later, I texted back. I think getting emotional via text is a bad idea. So I went like this:

""Let's have a coffee and talk. There are many things that are not clear in this situation. A face to face talk would be very good. Think about it"".


She didn't reply.


I am puzzled and divided, because:

A) A part of me thinks I shouldn't text her anymore, as I already tried twice (in person and by text). That I should wait for her to make a move (i.e. the ""decision"" she said she would make; also, she said ""you don't have to do anything""); also, absence makes the heart grow fonder. Through no contact she will miss me even more, a feeling of potential loss will be triggered and this will make her want to come back to me with greater urgency.

B) On the other hand, a part of me thinks I should fight for her because she might want to confirm that I will commit to her (I think she already knows I will, though), and I'm running out of time. That I should make an excuse like ""hey love, due to X reasons I am in your city this weekend, let's meet up. Let me know what time is okay for you"". However, I also think trying again after a week might make me look too needy. She might not have been available last time, and she might text me one of these days to meet up (my last text ended in ""think about it""). But I am not sure.

403,caj9qt,ineedagfbutisuck,I [16m] want to progress just texting to something more with a girl [16],"Help, so I've been texting this girl for almost 3 weeks now. We've met once before because she is an ex classmate of my best friend but I didn't talk too much with her then, just thought that she was pretty. So few weeks ago I stumble upon her instagram and find out that she has one common interest with me (metal and rock music, also we've got a lot of favorite bands in common) so I just sent her a short text saying that there aren't many girls listening to metal and pointed out a Panthera referece she had in her bio. Since then I've been texting her few times a day (2-3) and she always responded fast. The problem I have is that that I'm the one starting conversations mostly, like 80%, she did start a few times though. That's how I found out that she also plays guitar, same as me, favorite bands etc, that she likes sailing and some other things that we have in common.

So I wanna know what I can do to progress this further, I was thinking about asking her when is she at the beach so I can come by and say hi or something or ask my friend to do something.

Also, this is actually the second time in my life I started texting a girl, first time didn't end well because that girl was a major bitch but thats not the point. I dodged a bullet then.

Also I never had a gf before and I'm 16.

Even though we weren‚Äôt talking whenever I would talk to other women I would compare their personality and sense of humor to her‚Äôs and would always end up wishing I never ended what I had with her. A little over a year passes since I last talked to her and I somehow happened to see one of her posts on Facebook and I decided to just DM her. Everything is going great I‚Äôm talking to the girl I‚Äôve been crushing on for the past year again staying up all night talking to her on the phone just like old times. But then boom she just stops texting. So after about a week of not hearing anything from her I decided to just ask if she was okay. The next day she says she‚Äôs fine and that her phone broke so later that day we‚Äôre texting like normal and in the middle of the convo she just ghosts me.

407,caj47g,Deist31,Me (23M) and my girlfriend (22F) we met on erasmus and having distance relationship,"&amp;#x200B;

I'm  23 y.o guy from Istanbul, Turkey. Last year i stuided at Czech Republic  for 9 months. When i met my current girlfriend we were just friends for  5 months and last 3 months we spend together and almost 20 hours in  everyday last 2 months. Now she is back to France and I'm in Istanbul  looking for a university/job/scholarship precisely in France, Germany  and Switzerland at the same time in the middle of economical crysis so  my mind is kind of a fucked up.  Additional information, I'm living  alone since I hit 17 and working/studying at the same time.

Anyway,  I have stuff to ask you. It's been a month since we are living away  from each other texting everyday calling each other doing facetime in  every two days or so.  She has bought plane tickets for end of August to  see me in my place :)

I had long  distance relationship once but it was 500kms away so each weekend i had  chance to see her. But this distance is over 2000kms so as everyone  would've guessed there is no chance like seeing each other every  weekend. So, I'm looking for a ways to go and stay in Europe firstly for  my life and studies and besides it ( influenced by ) seeing my  girlfriend easily. But I do have so many questions about her behaviour  there.

First  of all, she is the one. Literally. She is the one. But sometimes she  can be frustrated and she is highly influenced by her environment like  she said to me. From parents, her friends etc.. Because of mostly they  are like "" yeaah long distance relationship will be difficult it is  really hard yeaah it'll end"" or some stuff like this. Especially when  they know I'm from Turkey. For records, my father is Serbian and I'm  half serbian also.

Doing  facetime or talking I let my emotions go and act like deeply from my  heart. For example the souveniers or things like meaningfull. For  example, a stone from a river which we did rafting and fell down and  injured ourselves. I'm keeping it and sending her picture like yeaah we  are far away but I have this now with small jokes and we are both  smiling and its over.

Today,  she told me, I feel like you are not loving me in good way i feel like  your love is "" CRAZY "" I never thought myself like a crazy lover, poor  loser with all you have is her love in your life or living the  relationship one sided. I'm sure we have same level of love but maybe  the problem is the way I showed it. Anyway, after she told me that, I  have reconsidered the things we spoke since we went away to our  countries. Once or twice she popped out with the things like distance  relationship is too hard and we can't see each other all the time, you  will be in Istanbul we have different lives.. While phoning and she was  crying at the same time. She already knew that I am looking for  solutions to live in middle Europe but I reminded her these things and  we get along at the end all the time.

The  plan in my head, for my future is going and sattling down and study in  Europe to save my life from this country. But I also don't want to lose  her because we shared almost everything and like I said, I believe "" She  is the one"". Meanwhile I'm searching for the ways to study in these  countries, I'm afraid of losing her because of time/distance. Because it  might be this semester starting from september, might be in the winter  semester starting from january or might be the next september. It is  still not certain.

So dear reddittors, please tell me. What should I do? I really need some advices and consultance. Thank you",2019-07-08 10:01:23,0,0,relationship_advice

So I was recently catching up with an old friend and filling her in on all the recent life drama. Among those topics of conversation was a semi-recent breakup I had (I'm over it now but it made for an interesting conversation so it was definitely worth bringing up). I won't go into too much detail because it's not super relevant, but after five months my partner at the time broke up with me very suddenly. I was surprised and hurt because it felt like the break-up came out of left field and I thought we were in love. As soon as I said the words ""in love"", my friend kind of recoiled. She said we'd only been together for ~5 months and that wasn't enough time to be in love. I vocalized that I felt it was an appropriate amount of time to know how you feel and she said she ""strongly disagrees"". I've been unable to stop thinking about this for the past few days since I had this conversation. So Reddit, what is the appropriate amount of time it should take to fall in love?

411,caj1sa,TastyPomegranate1,"My SO's parents don't like me (25M) because I consider her (24F) to be a functioning adult, and we're less than a month away from a breaking point","We're in a relationship that's getting close to its third complete year.

I'm way more independent than she is. Despite being 24, she still lives with her parents (always has), and she still has a curfew. I, on the other hand, live very far from any of my relatives (~100 miles apart) for a number of years now. Her parents don't consider her as a functioning adult, and I think the biggest reason that we're doing so well for so long is because I do.

We're completely equal, always have been. We make compromises, we find a common ground somewhere in the middle, and despite having really different interests, we don't try to force our views onto each other. As an example, she enjoys K-rock, I enjoy electronic music. We're both open-minded enough that we can listen to each other's music, even though we don't see the appeal in it that the other person sees.

We live in a rather... cynical society, in which our relationship is more of an exception than a rule. We have a saying that translates roughly to ""like a drop of water on a palm"", meaning that a male figure should basically worship a female figure in order for her to feel happy. I highly disagree with that. I think the secret to a healthy relationship is to be completely equal, and our relationship is, in its core, built on that foundation.

I have no problem with that, she has no problem with that, her sister doesn't have a problem with that, but the rest of her extended family (with her parents at the forefront) do see a problem with that. To the point where I can't physically spend some time together with her parents without one of the sides snapping, and to the point where her parents actively try to undermine our relationship because of a stupid belief that I won't make her happy.

I think what they are worried the most is that I'm in this to abuse her, which couldn't be further from the truth. She has a fair amount of savings, and so do I. I currently don't have a job and live off my savings (though that's probably changing in September), and they think that I'm stealing money from her. Easy assumption to make, though a blatantly wrong one. If there's one thing I've learned from my parents surviving deep, deep debt, it's to never owe anyone anything. Never took out a loan, never borrowed money, never intend to do so. I posses a fair amount of material items, but I've worked my ass off for every single one of them. Her parents are still in a huge debt, they went through a pretty rough change in their paychecks that makes them unable to handle that debt properly, and I think that their survival instinct kicked in and that they're treating her unfairly because of that. Her sister left the country and has a huge amount of drama in her life as well, but my SO never left her home for an extended period of time. The frustration that builds up in her parents gets channelled into her, and it's taking a huge toll on her mental state.

She will always have a place to stay. She doesn't have to pay a dime if she decides to do so, because I have to pay the full price regardless of whether she lives with me or not. Unlike her, I have nothing to fall back on in this city. I'm aware that her living here would compromise that completely-equal foundation that we have, so I don't try to force it as an option. That option is definitely on the table and she's aware of that, but it has to be her own decision to do so.

Finally, they're completely failing at breaking us apart. Our relationship has always been strong, but her family completely fails at realizing that. I can't say that she's The One, because I don't believe in that concept. What I can say is that we're just different enough and just open-minded enough that we see the beauty in each other, the beauty that's difficult to see from the outside.

It's gotten to the point where they've actually threatened to kick her out. As far as I'm aware, for the first time. The reason for that is an outdoor music festival that happens in my hometown that we go to every year. We want to do so this year as well, but she had some health problems that makes her unable to spend an extended period of time in the sun. Of course, I'm fucking aware of that, so I've purchased us VIP tickets that offer plenty of sunshades and fans to make the experience bearable for her. Instead, they're basically forcing her into going to the beach with them in August, despite the doctor saying that she shouldn't do that before September at least. So, it's not going out on the sun that's a problem for them, it's going out on the sun *with me*, because they're failing to grasp the very basic concept of us being equal parts in our relationship instead of trying to undermine each other.

What do I do? Do we suck things up even if it means that their side wins or do we actually stand our ground and have fun for the two days? I feel like I've sucked things up far too many times for the benefit of their relationship, and that not standing our ground would not get us to the conclusion. On the contrary, it would just shift the problem until the next issue in which our desires don't collide with her parents desires.

**tl;dr:** I consider my SO to be a fully-functioning adult, her parents don't. Due to the series of circumstances, the problems are gonna reach their breaking point in about a month from now, and we don't know whether to stand our ground or to just let go for the benefit of her relationship with her parents. 

**P.S.** In order to emphasize how important that festival is to me: I basically spend no time in my hometown. Those few days in the middle of the summer have always been an exception. It's what brings me back every year. Last year, I've lived on a different side of the continent, thousands of miles away. I took a vacation just to be on that festival with her, and paid a gigantic amount of money just to be there. I expect us to be there, she expects us to be there, my parents expect us to be there, and there's a bunch of people that I'm gonna re-connect with in person thanks to that festival. It's not that I can't miss the festival per se, it's that it's difficult to miss it when it's what keeps me connected with my former self, and the possibility of not going there and sharing that experience with her this year is what's eating me up. The festival lasts from 4pm to 2am, and we don't have to see the first few acts, so, of course, she won't be outside when it's the worst temperature-wise. We both know that, but her parents refuse to acknowledge that.",2019-07-08 09:52:32,7,17,relationship_advice

\- Almost two years ago she decided to have children (I had been ready for 8 years), but we have made love approximately 3 times since then.

\- Whenever I try to approach her, I'm too hot, too cold, it's not the right moment...

\- She's attracted to me, but clearly not fisically... no matter what I do. And I'm guessing she has one or more emotional child traumas, but she denies it and does not want to go to the doctor.

\- This has happened since the night we went to live together back in 2008, so we barely have fisical contact.

\- This is not the first time I post here. And I have tried 120 tricks in the book.

\- Anyway, I still see myself growing old with her, and having children etc...

&amp;#x200B;

Relationship B is friendship with a woman who is attractive, and in a relationship (living together for 3 months):

\- It's normal for me to have 45' long sms converstations, but everyday... not.

\- We both try to limit our interactions but we do lots of stuff together, like running races and do stuff that our partners don't do (it's called friendship)

\- I feel attracted to her, but I'm not a cheater and I still love A, but fisically I get much more from B than from A, sadly.

\- B talks shit about her relationship, we have a lot of fun and it's difficult to end our encounters (BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED)

\- When she's with me I find her to be happy, smiling all the time, and sharp funny (I like sarcasm), and she's not like that when we are with other people

\- If this is emotional cheating, please let me know... I'm a mess, I think of B all the time, but I have days when I think I've fallen in love with someone else and days when I think it's crush/bromance.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions are:

\- Is this going the way I think it's going?

\- What is the right thing to do? 

\- What do you think, anything, help me, ask me anything before being too harsh, I know I'm a shitperson but I didn't sign up for this.

415,caiyyl,joejmeyers,My Dad died with child support owed. His side of the family is trying to collect his assets and I am not sure what I am entitled to or how to ask for if.,"I'm not sure how appropriate this is for this community, so please lead me in another direction if it would be helpful. I'm not sure where to start either so I'll just try to provide as much context as possible. My father recently passed away and I'm going to turn 18 in a few weeks. 

My parents got divorced when I was about 1 year old and he has been paying about $100/mo most of my life. When they were married he was pretty financially responsible and capable of providing for my mother, sister, and I. I believe they had a condo and things seemed fine. There's nothing wrong with him, he just became negative and self-destructive with his life after they got divorced. He was homeless at one point, living in his shop. He moved back in with his mother for a few years as well. He was very argumentative and blamed everyone but himself for his problems. He was just lost direction I suppose. 

He owed $15,000+ to my mother in child support and has a 2010 (maybe 2011 or 2012) Honda Civic with a newly replaced transition. His mother is disrespectful to my mother and isn't very supportive of my sister and I. 

My mother took full custody when we were 11 and 12 and kept us closer to her side of the family. My father was having a negative influence on everyone around him including the three of us. He was emotionally, verbally, and eventually physically abusive with my mother before they divorced. He continued being verbally abusive with my mother, often citing my upbringing as a example of her incompetence as a mother. He continued the emotional abuse with me, planting seeds and trying to be manipulative. He tried to get us against each other-- tear us apart so we would get distracted and stop holding him accountable for his responsibilities as a parent. 

Naturally, we grew away from him and his family. My mother didn't take much support from her mother-in-law nor did she build a strong relationship with her. Hence, my grandmother is showing some hostility and interest in calling our local police department (my mother, sister, Dad, and I all live together in another county) to manage the whole situation. 

The police investigation is still coming to a close and the police report has not been released to the public yet. She's also taking over funeral arrangements. He didn't write a will, so I'm not sure what's supposed to happen with his car. He also has a lot of valuable power tools at work. I'm not in that line of work, but they are still worth thousands of dollars. 

First an foremost, would it be appropriate to ask for his car or tools? Should they be liquidated and then distributed between my sister and I? Also, would it be appropriate to expect my grandmother to take responsibility of his unpaid child support? I am not entirely sure what I can do or should do.

416,caiyoq,confusedwithtz,"Help, a guy cuddled me very intensely and I found out he has a girlfriend, wtf do I do.","To give context, I (F, 20) recently joined a theatre group and they're all a very affectionate bunch. 
As I'm very new, I didn't get a lot of bonding time with most people. Except for last weekend. We were all sitting around a firepit and somehow we decided that head massages were a great idea, so some cuddle puddles were formed. Another guy sat between my legs, while I leaned against the guy in question, let's call him Tim.
At some point, I started giving him head scritches and he kind of lovingly scratched me arms and legs in return (this is kind of hard to describe) and then there were some really nice head kisses on his part. All around a very intimate situation. I really don't think he was drunk (maybe two beers at most)  and my friend, who has known him a bit longer says that's just how he is and everyone has been a little in love with him at some point. 
This weekend I found out about his girlfriend (who is lovely) and saw how they interacted with each other. And maybe it is because he's a good deal older than me (15 years) or it's just because that's really how he treats everyone, because he's a genuinely good person (he works with special needs kids and cares about women's rights) and it's just how he is... But it just won't go out of my head. I have cuddled with other guys previously and as soon as kisses of any kind were involved, the notion of this being platonic was straight out of the window.

418,caiyhc,kyuubianist,Someone I love wants a break,"Hello everyone, I am looking for your kind advice here. I have been single all my life (1 sided love, the other 3 girls never love me back) and many of my friends and girls said that I am very nice and sweet. and I just started working for the last 2 years. Last year, I start dating with an older girl who is 33 and I am 30, she just apply divorce (still in process, and she has not been living with him for over 2 years )with her ex-husband too. 

&amp;#x200B;

We started casual chatting and hangouts, flirting (she told me she is looking for a someone that can be potential husband) and slowly became love, for about 1 year and 1 month plus, we enjoyed our time together, hold hands, my first kiss, trips, activities, we fought a bit sometime but nothing serious. But we were never become an official couple, I was planning to ask her after her divorce process done. But when she was doing the divorce process with her ex, he talked to her about me that she should marry someone who is stable, has house/car, and she started crying when she talk about this topic with her ex. I know her, house and car can come after. There is only 2 things that I understood why she do not want to further our relationship. 1.) she does not sees me as a potential husband yet (because I am younger than her and she thinks that I can do better with someone else 2.) I am a Muslim and she is a Buddhist, she has no plans to change religion yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

July 6 2019 was our last date and we talk our hearts out, we both cry and laugh at the same time, we both still love each other, like a real couple. She gave a deep kiss when we left my room. I know marriage is a big thing, but I still believe in my heart that we can overcome it, so I respect her decision for a break with our relationship. Not knowing if we can get back together or not. What I know I must do now is to make her see me as a potential husband, and I can provide her much her happiness than before. As for religion, I love and respect the way she is, and she loves me and respects as the way I am. I miss very much, like a part of my life and heart is missing.

&amp;#x200B;

I greatly appreciate for any kind/harsh words for this relationship. Please let me know if you have any questions. I really want to make this work out between us. Thank you.",2019-07-08 09:40:49,2,1,relationship_advice
419,caiyfs,Lady_Camo,Should I stop giving compliments to my SO?,"I (29/F) have been together with my SO (23/M) for about a year now.

I often give compliments to my SO. Often I just look at him and just find him so incredibly sexy. I love his eyes, his lips, his hair, his hair color, his body. I tell him when cuddling, but he always replies smiling or giggling with ""you see the world differently than others"" or ""in your world"" or ""I believe you think this way"" or even just straight out ""nope"". Even when I tell him things like how awesome I think it is he's working hard to balance work with his studies, or thank him for caring about certain things (we do not live together, so often he offers to order pizza or something instead of eating my food in the fridge away or making me cook), he always replies with ""I'm nothing special"" or similar.

So I start to worry that I come off as pushy? I really want to tell him how much I appreciate him, but not at the cost of making him uncomfortable. On the other hand I do not want him to feel less wanted if I stop doing it. I just can't wrap my head around it, any help would be very appreciated :)

420,caiy9h,StevieK03,Do I still have a shot?,"Reddit! I really need your help!

 I was in a relationship for 6 months with a woman who in my eyes was really endearing and possibly everything I could ask for in someone, personality, character, ambition, looks, etc... you name it. 

Our relationship ended about 2 months ago because of my busy work schedule. I had a huge project at work that took away a lot of my time, (weekends included) from her (1.5 months). It was communicated to her in advance, but I think it was too much for her to handle at the time. As a result, she disconnected from me to avoid feeling the way she did, it even caused her to resent me. It was a big change compared to before where we‚Äôd speak for hours a day at a time.

I almost forgot to mention I live in NY and She lives in Florida. I never considered distance to be a major factor, as I can freely travel on the weekends (2 hour trip) now to go see her and I have before the breakup. After she ended the relationship, we still maintained light contact.

She has recently been calling and reaching out more frequently and has informed me that she will be coming for 4 days in August. I told her that I would show her around, since she‚Äôs never been here before.

We have spoken about our relationship many times and she has told me she no longer has any resentment or negative feelings for me anymore.

Anyways, I would like to know if/how I can re-ignite the spark in our relationship during her visit?",2019-07-08 09:40:08,1,1,relationship_advice

424,caiv53,kilij9988,Trying to re-establish trust,"My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half now. When we started dating, I was in a really bad place mentally. I was struggling with self-esteem issues and severe anxiety (still do, but I've been seeing a therapist and am doing better now). I had warned him in the beginning that I'm in a bad place, and he was very sweet about it, saying he wants to be there for me.

He has been there for me. Not always perfect, but he has been incredibly supportive through those first months to a year. The issue is that it put an incredible amount of pressure on him. I have been a pretty terrible girlfriend to him; not really mean or abusive or anything like that, but always insecure, always making a big deal out of things that aren't (reading too much into anything that happens around me and stressing about dumb stuff). I have apologized countless times and felt bad while going through the whole thing, but I was doing so bad that I was barely capable of holding myself together, not to mention presenting my positive side.

I completely acknowledge that it was selfish of me to be in a relationship like that in the first place, and I feel guilty for doing that to him, but I also can't get too mad at myself because I remember how lonely I felt and how supportive he has been. It's so hard to push someone so good away.

As I was saying, I have been doing better, and a lot of it is thanks to him. The struggle is that I feel like he still sees me the same way, and it's making him worry way too much and resent me. He has admitted before that having to constantly be there for me has caused him to feel some resentment, and it's totally understandable. I have been working my butt off to prove to him that I'm better, and I really really really want him to see my good side, but I feel like at this point he's conditioned to interpret any reaction as the most negative one, but never mention it to me (because of fear of confrontation) and secretly feed that resentment.

We are just in this incredibly frustrating cycle of misunderstandings that are fueled by being burnt too many times. He doesn't tell me when something bothers him, which leads to me trying to squeeze it out of me because I'm trying to work on communicating. As most human beings, I am frequently wrong and then it seems like I'm just investigating him, and it's tiring to both of us.

I just want to get his trust again. I want him to feel secure and safe and believe his girlfriend is not an emotional time bomb. But it's been almost six months since I've been feeling like myself again and he is still acting as worried of me as ever. I really really don't want to end it because he is amazing and I do think we work well together, I believe it's fixable. Any advice on how?",2019-07-08 09:29:54,2,1,relationship_advice
425,caiuqx,hyaluronicacid2,East Asian Mom (50sF) often emotionally spirals and I am unsure if I'm (25F) in the wrong.,"I'm unsure if there is something wrong with me so bear with me because I need more clarity on the situation as a whole. I live with my mom in a one bedroom apartment. I genuinely find this really hard to bear so I am often not home. I prefer being at my boyfriend's apartment because his roommate is at work in the morning, and so is my boyfriend. I often get long hours to be by myself where I have sometimes wasted time but primarily I've just been working on my creative portfolio since I've recently been laid off. 

&amp;#x200B;

No matter what, my mom seems to find the fact that I don't enjoy being at home as a personal insult. She has said things like I have no personal sense of duty, am lazy, needs to be picked up after. She knows my boyfriend has a very organized personality so she often makes offhanded comments to him about how it must be hard to live with me (he has told me this narrative is untrue.) 

&amp;#x200B;

She absolutely can't stand that I am somewhere else... has even suggested to me that if I need quiet time, then I should be going to the public library and then come home afterwards. I do not want to do that. If I'm in a public setting, then I often need to watch over my things. I like being at my bf's house because it's quiet and I get to leave my laptop, phone, tech around without worrying it'll get jacked. I told her this, she said it's just because i'm avoiding her and I hate being at home. Am I ungrateful because I don't want to?

&amp;#x200B;

I never went to college unlike my friends and siblings and as a result, I really... sometimes desperately seek to be alone. I've never felt the experience of being away or even being free. I'm irritated at home, but I've been told that my moods is insulting, ungrateful, and I'm generally just a cold, distant, and unattentive daughter. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom doesn't work. She only depends on my estranged dad who is not present and also in a foreign country and me to make ends meet. And she frequently tells me that I am not attentive enough at home.

&amp;#x200B;

I think maybe I need more clarity... anybody who is East Asian-American tell me if there is a problem here? 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I not fulfilling my cultural sense of filial piety? I literally don't know what to say because I'm 25 turning 26. I do want my own life. I want to have a life of my own. Am I a bad person? Am I supposed to be home all the time helping my mom with chores? My mom has even suggested that she should move in with me and all of my friends if I decide to move out. I said no because I am sure that my own friends might find this to be a bit uncomfortable. She found this hurtful. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel exasperated because at this point of my life, shouldn't parents be telling me to basically get the fuck out and to move out? I feel like the only person in this situation where I'm told the completely opposite and in fact, I naive, lazy, and have ""American tendencies"" and I am not a GOOD daughter because of the way I feel about seeking my own independence. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am stressed and scared because my mom has done absolutely nothing to give herself a stable life. I feel so guilty that I am unable to help. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing because I apparently can't do anything right. What the fuck is happening? What can I even do? Am I not doing something right?

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I do want to say yes... ""mom, I'm avoiding you because I don't agree with your life choices anymore"" but she only goes into hysterics and I am already in constant stress enough as it is. She tells me that my dad has paid for my comfortable life... but is it comfortable? I literally am always stressed we can't make rent. My mom doesn't help, just has tantrums until my dad figures something out and I cap whatever I can to pay for the rest. 

&amp;#x200B;

I literally don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I live in one bedroom with my mom, can't stand it, I like to work in places that are not home. Mom can't bear this... thinks I am avoiding her which I am. I can't really tolerate the energy she gives anymore. Constantly helplessness, constant crying. My mom has been the most independent person I knew growing up, but it doesn't seem like it anymore. Can I live my life without continuing to damage my relationship with my mom? Am I in the wrong in a cultural sense? Am I dutifully suppose to pay for her retirement? 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly wouldn't have so much of a problem if I felt like my mom had her own autonomy and agency. She just seems to have given up and punishes me for seeking better prospects because I am abandoning her. Am I? I don't even know what to do because I already struggle to just take care of myself.",2019-07-08 09:28:27,3,1,relationship_advice

427,caitxh,vaio_v,I resent my girlfriend a LOT for things others may find normal. It makes me treat her unfair at times. How do I clear my mind?,"Been dating my girlfriend for 1 year now. She is a freshman, I am a Sophomore and we met at a college party. 

We did something at the party, exchanged phone numbers and then started going out, a few weeks later. We caught feelings fast and I could see myself dating the girl. I was super excited and was communicating my developing feelings to her. She was new to college and told me straight up she was afraid of dating someone, fearing her heart would be broken etc. She was also a virgin, so that explains a lot. She is very insecure and from a strict family so it is normal for her not wanting to commit right away, but...

With that being said, we agreed to continue seeing each other and going out, but we would be free to see other people too. It was mainly her, she wanted to go out to college parties and ‚Äúhave fun, exploring‚Äù. We told each other that we were falling for one another yet this things kept happening for 3 months. It hurt a lot seeing her go out to parties. It was like we were dating. Everyone saw her and referred to me as her boyfriend, yet she went out and hooked up with others. I only did it once and then I realized she is the one for me and immediately stopped. I didn‚Äôt want to push her into the relationship either so I gave her space and time, rather than to lose the girl...

Fast forward to now, we have been dating and I am particularly happy with my relationship. Its just moments where I remember the past and I won‚Äôt lie, I hold grudges against her. I have told her, its like she never gave me a real shot. I was just there waiting. Then sometimes she talks about those months and she occasionally makes me play games such as ‚Äúrate other people we‚Äôve HU with‚Äù or she will ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù show me snaps with hickies on her neck not from me, or NSFW snaps she would send to other people while going out with me. For example, we both said I love you before dating officially, yet she still saw someone at a party after that...  She has admitted to saying she did these things to make me jealous (the games) and make herself look valuable in my eyes. When I asked why she did those things in the early days, she usually said because she was too scared from high school that I would leave her or something (has been sexually assaulted, and had a rough time with depression and problems like that). She would ‚Äújust go out and felt lonely because I go to a different school in town and was ‚Äúhorny‚Äù and tried to resemble all the guys to me. 
 
All these things have built up huge resentment against her, and sometimes they kill my days and mood with her. Sometimes I look at her, and all I think is what she did. Is that normal? How should I approach this? I believe this girl is for me, we both want to marry each other (yes I know 1 year may not be enough but I think we have dug down to each others souls enough to know what we want from each other) and I have fun with her, but this makes me dislike her and have the tendency of not wanting to talk to her and break up, because I feel I was disrespected.",2019-07-08 09:25:27,14,2,relationship_advice

This morning while I was transferring some holiday photos from my fianc√©‚Äôs phone to myself via WhatsApp. Someone sent a Whatsapp text and I accidentally saw the preview, ‚ÄúHey bby! I‚Äôm having fever...‚Äù the sender has a woman‚Äôs name. (Yes it‚Äôs spelt as ‚Äòbby‚Äô in the message, not sure if the sender was trying to type ‚Äòbaby‚Äô or what) I did not click into the message to view the full message.  I have no idea who this woman is. 
After I‚Äôm done transferring photos, I just told my fianc√© that he has some messages. He just view the message, not sure if he replied, and he deleted the message. 

Some background of myself. I am someone who doesn‚Äôt snoop around. I don‚Äôt check my fianc√©‚Äôs phone because I believe in privacy. So seeing that message preview is really by pure chance.   However, after seeing the text, I tried to snoop around a lil. I don‚Äôt see anything regarding the sender. She doesn‚Äôt exist in the call log or messages. My fiance has 2 phones, 1 issued by the company for work and 1 for personal use. The woman‚Äôs contact is in both work phone and personal phone. The message preview I saw was on work phone. He usually only uses workphone to contact his colleagues and me. 

I‚Äôm not very sure what to think of this. I would say for past 6 years we have been in v trusting and stable relationship. We have never had any argument over anyone else before and I would say we have always been open with our whereabouts, who we hang out with. So far both of us are chill about such things. I can feel that my fiance loves me a lot through his action and speech for the past 6 years. 

I‚Äôm sure eventually I will ask him about the message and continue to keep all communication opens as always. 

It would be very hard for me to imagine possibility of my fiance cheating because I think he‚Äôs happy in our relationships and we frequently spent time together every week. He always spend weekends with me and even my family. We also text regularly everyday throughout the day. I don‚Äôt even think he has the time to cheat. No suspicious or unusual behaviour from him other than the text preview I saw. We also just returned from a short, relaxing holiday yesterday. He frequently talks about our future together and he looks forward to owning a house together. He has even been looking through property listing and interior design for our future house quite frequently. 

I‚Äôm not sure the message was accidentally sent to him which was why it was deleted or what. Wanted to write this down somewhere and hear some advice before I ask him about the message.",2019-07-08 09:25:26,5,1,relationship_advice

While I was pregnant last year I had all day sickness. Hubs asked the dr multiple times if people can even be sick that much because he didn't believe me and hardly helped me.

 30+ hours of labor (I went into labor an hour after he fell asleep and let him sleep all night.) Day 2 at the hospital I had to kick him out because he was being so mean and rude and kept telling me he was ""too tired"" from everything.

Then our anniversary where I got no gift but had bought him one.

I was put on breastfeeding medication that made me gain 40 lbs (60lbs up now).

Valentine's day no gift, got him one.

We had sex around this time where he didn't finish and told me I was ""fucking disgusting from all the weight I gained and he couldn't get off to someone so fat""

Our house had major construction. We did some work ourselves, it's half done.

Mother's day I got no gifts.

Now we are back in our house. Baby has been sick for six weeks since.

My friend died from an overdose and my husband didn't want to go to the funeral.

A month ago my step sister passed away. 

That same week I was very sick for three days. Third day he says he has pink eye and is going to urgent care. I call my mom to watch the kids but hubs flips out. Calls me names. Is pissed he has to take me because the house is dirty and he doesn't want MIL to see it.

Fourth of July. Hubs stayed home to work on the house. Didnt. Slept all day and night.

Then was my sisters funeral. I asked my hubs to call in to go with me he told me no (he also gets funeral leave at work).

husband works 1030pm-9-11am. Sleeps, picks baby up from daycare at 6 puts her to bed at 7-730. I get up with baby get ready for daycare/work 8am-7-10pm. I'm up with baby all night. Hubs sleeps during the day on the weekend, I take care of kids, do most of the grocery shopping/meal prep, cleaning.

 My neighbor offered to help all weekend finish our house. Hubs slept. I asked him to have him come over and I would do the work. Hubs refused. Said he was ""too tired"". He slept a couple hours sat morning before they came to clean the air ducts and he refused to do anything all day or night because I ruined his sleep having them come.

Tonight I told him I wastired of him not helping and not getting stuff done. 

 He blows up and tells me no because we haven't had sex since I was pregnant. I brought up what he said he's like yeah well we both let ourselves go (he's about 320lbs I said well at least I had a reason. I told him he's not supportive, isn't there when I need him, and he doesn't take care of me. He said I don't need him to because I'm an adult.

Finally I told him I want to go to therapy. He said no. I told him I've tried over and over to get him to hear me and he's not listening to my needs so I want to go talk to someone he will listen to and he said he won't listen to them either.

2 days after the positive test I miscarried. He seemed upset but not as far as I was and few days after he seemed like he had got over it, though he gave me all the support I needed. Yesterday I found on his messenger a convo with his sister and he was telling her ‚ÄúI am sad this happened; I wish she didn‚Äôt get pregnant in the first place. But I feel relieved and I think it‚Äôs better that it happened this way. I just realized I didn‚Äôt want kids with her‚Äù. He never told me he was relieved, and he never mentioned abortion when I told him I was pregnant! And he seemed really concerned about my health status. He seemed to be doing ‚Äúwhat had to be done‚Äù.

I am very shocked but before I confront him I would like to know what do you think he meant with his words. If he is relived, why did he seem upset? And if he didn‚Äôt want to have kids with me why didn‚Äôt he mention to me he would consider abortion? 

Thank you all in advance.",2019-07-08 09:15:28,111,18,relationship_advice
434,caiqh4,Myriam12345,Boyfriend loves to drink,"Dear all,

I would like to have your perspective on this. I'm together with an amazing man (40years old), who loves drinking. He is sweet, caring, funny and helps me a lot with my emotional issues. He loves drinking and especially getting drunk. He has liver problems due to his drinking. Although, he doesn't believe he has a problem. He used to drink every night (couple of beers, a bottle of wine or half a bottle of whiskey). After a couple of months dating, I started to get annoyed by his drinking. He used to drink when I was already in bed alone in my house or when he was with friends. His behavior doesn't change significantly, but it is difficult to have a conversation with him (sometimes he doesnt even remember what happened). He might be a bit annyoing. And the next day he is obviously hangover and will just be in bed. We had a good conversation about his drinking and he promised to limit his drinking and get help. We had some amazing weeks. Where he would only drink at weekends with friends. He did get withdrawal symptoms, like shaking etc. But then he started drinking again by himself. Some beers after we came back from a festival at my home and he went to a bar at 3pm (he told me he just went for a walk, but decided to get a drink). He got completely wasted and was sleeping at my couch at 8pm.
I'm devastated. He was doing so great! But I feel his promises are empty. He told me he would go to an addition specialist, but he didn't. He told me he would not drink alone at my place, but he still did it again. I know he is an alcoholic and he has been one for years. He promised to get help and better himself for me. I have a lot of anxiety due to this. I don't know if I should believe him. I have to say, i do drink as well. Not as much, but usually twice a week I will have a couple of drinks. 

Please, can you give me some advice. Should I keep supporting him and wait?",2019-07-08 09:13:06,14,1,relationship_advice
435,caipij,KaleebBringerofLight,Having thoughts about leaving GF want opinions,"     Hello all! I am 21M and my GF 19F is leaving for college in a little over a month in another state. We've been together for a little over a year (my longest relationship by far), and have been friends for 3 or so. We got together not too long after she broke up with her abusive exbf of 2 years and everything has been great until recently.

     Im not sure what happened but all the excitement has gone out of the relationship. When we see each other the only thing we do is watch netflix/hulu/whatever, when I ask her if she wants to go out somewhere she tells me no bc her i.b.s. (reasonable excuse I guess), she refuses to talk about what the plan is for dealing with our soon to be long distance relationship, and our sexlife has become stale.

     I have thoughts of leaving her periodically but Im not sure if Im feeling this way because shes leaving soon and Ive been told that long distance relationships never work out mixed with a lack if communication on both sides or what the deal is.",2019-07-08 09:09:49,3,1,relationship_advice
436,caio6c,phille_1999,I [M20] started getting strange thoughts about my relationship which I know aren't true but come to my mind all the time.,"  

I don't really know how to start. I met my girlfriend almost a year ago and had a crush on her after about 3 weeks. We wrote a lot of texts and met after a while. I started to know her better and realized that we have a lot in common. I always loved the way she dressed and am generally physically attracted to her.

I am now 20 years old and she is the first girl that was interested in me, I used to be lonely and had social anxiety problems which I still haven‚Äôt got over completely. My relationship with my parents wasn't good either, so I was all alone. I never felt so much affection from somebody before.

I love every moment with her, every message from her and as soon as something more important happens I share it with her without hesitation. I really love her. We also talk a lot about our future.

But some time ago I started getting very strange thoughts. They are like those intrusive thoughts when you walk by a river and think about throwing your phone in it. It‚Äôs almost like I started looking for imperfections or something like that, I don‚Äôt really know how it started. I started questioning everything like ‚ÄúDo I really want that?‚Äù even though I know I really do. Those thoughts started coming very frequently and now I am at a point where I can‚Äôt get rid of them. I question everything even though one moment before I was sure I want it.  

I think this is because of my past and I also considered getting professional help. I tried talking about it to her, but I am really scared that she wouldn‚Äôt understand, and I don‚Äôt want to hurt her.

I know I want her, and I love her, but these thoughts are extremely heavy, and I feel like destroying everything. I am really scared of losing her. Please help.",2019-07-08 09:05:21,4,1,relationship_advice

J has been trying to figure out the best course of action so I thought i‚Äôd see if strangers on the internet with no bias had any opinions? Thanks!

438,cail5z,QueryTA,Girlfriend [F19] is too insecure and we'll probably argue if I [M21] for example attend my work summer event,"My girlfriend has been through a lot, her previous two boyfriends both were unfaithful and cheated on her. So you can imagine how insecure she is. To clarify, she claims that she trusts me and I believe her, because we both are crazy about each other.

She doesn't really have any contact with other men since she works as a beautician. On the contrary, I'm an accountant and my workplace is full of women and she is aware of that.

My girlfriend and I literally do everything together and we don't really go out (to events) without each other. The thing is that my work organizes a lot of yearly events which are only for employees only. I would like to attend these events because they are all so nice and very professional. But I'm sure that my girlfriend wouldn't be happy about this because she would probably think that I'll just spend the night flirting and speaking to other women..

Does anyone has any advice on how to approach this?Should I just go with it and accept that I can't really go to these things without her?

TL:DR - Girlfriend is super insecure and wouldn't be happy if I attend work events alone

I put it in the living room near my video games, as a gaming nerd would.  Well when I was away the cat triggered it and it recorded my wife web caming or video chatting with some bloke for 2 hours in the other room. The convo was muffled on his end but I could hear bits and pieces of her. Most of it was her and him masterbating, and her flirting. I usually check my cameras when the cat triggers it because its usually really funny, she often scoots her ass across the carpet. This time I was at work the next day and realized there was a 3 hour video that was recorded because the cat was pacing around the living room ( she usually stays in the bedroom but my wife doing her thing seemed to scare her). It was devastating and I have almost forgiven her since she seemed sincere about not doing it again.... only doing it twice... supposedly it was with a stranger. yadda yadda. My questions are, other than should I remain with her, (1) is there a way to find out if she was web caming for money, (2) if there is a way to find out if this bloke on the other end was actually a guy she dated on the side but was located somewhere else. Sure, I asked her mutiple times and she acts like she doesnt recall the first time and that it was just chaturbate... then she changed it to chatroulette.... Any advice?

442,caiiww,pebernd0910,My bf (18) and I (F17) have an open and honest relationship of 2yrs. Recently he opened up about thinking of breaking up with me because he thinks we are different people. I'm really scared and conflicted and I'm not sure how to emotionally process this information bc I'm emotionally inept.,"(On mobile, sorry for formatting)

So this is the first romantic relationship I've had with someone - Meaning I've never been through a breakup before. We've been dating for 2 years now, and whilst I've always been aware of the inevitability of a breakup, it's now become SO REAL and I'm really scared. 

My past wasn't the best, it was full of emotional manipulation and physical abuse, which has led to a variety of mental illnesses, so this relationship has really given me the ability to heal and develop some confidence in myself. I'm also in the middle of year 12 (I'm in Aus) so I'm really worried about a breakup impacting my grades (they're not great at the moment so I need to fix it). 
He said he'd be considerate of my studies but he's going to prioritise himself (which I understand but still, I'm upset).

Due to the above of abuse etc.. I now have *no idea* how to process this information. My usual routes of repression and denial will obviously not work, so I'm stuck trying to distract myself and being sad when i remember a possible looming breakup. 

I still want the relationship to stay the same but I feel like there's a rift between us that is growing every day. 

I know I'm young but I really value and treasure this relationship - please help me. 

I need to know how to process this without exacerbating my mental illnesses.

The truth is I'm nothing but unhappy. Exactly 3 years ago, my wife of 24 years deserted me. With her left our son. Like most couples there were disagreements. However a step as drastic as this one was inconceivable to me.


 It turns out that my close friend was the one who brought a schism in our relationship. Who do I trust? Next I'm dismissed from work. I've lost not only most of my savings settling the divorce case but also the will to live. Who or what do I live for? People advised me to visit medical professionals. I did. Their treatment was ineffective.



I'm told that I should be happy with myself before seeking the company of others. I don't give a rat's ass about such hackneyed remarks. Only those who've gone through this phase will be able to comprehend how painful it is.

Every night when I go to bed I pray for a reunion of my family. I know it's improbable. Even while I write this I've a feeling my heart is going to burst open. That sinking feeling.

The reason it affected me a lot is because i watched them depart in the airport and everything looked so real... they cried, kissed, hugged. Swiss guy already booked tickets to visit her in  DR, now everyone I talked to told me it‚Äôs not my business and I shouldn‚Äôt intervene.

How to navigate this complicated relationship?,"I apologize for the long post, but this is even the condensed version of what is otherwise 20 years of toxicity. My dad has serious issues. Health, mental, and emotional. I‚Äôll start by saying he‚Äôs had kidney failure for almost 20 years. In fact, he‚Äôs coming up on the time that no one has lived past with his condition. Without a transplant he has 4 years to live, max. Recently, he has been diagnosed with having tumors on his kidneys. So he isn‚Äôt doing the best health wise. He is also a narcissist, pathological liar and possible sociopath. He has done many selfish things, including an opioid addiction that existed throughout my entire childhood with him. Emotionally, he has been used and abused his entire life. He has issues with being alone, and he NEEDS someone to love him. Recently him and his wife broke up, and she did and said a lot of things that broke his spirit. 

He‚Äôs dying. I don‚Äôt want him to die. I have a lot of reasons to be angry with him and even dislike him, but I don‚Äôt. I love my dad, unconditionally. I‚Äôve hardly spoken to him the past few years as I‚Äôve found that boundaries are the only way to deal with people like him. But recently, he has been going through a hard time. He didn‚Äôt contact his family or my younger brother in months and we didn‚Äôt know if he was in jail, in the hospital, or dead. I finally called him and after ignoring my call a few times he answered. At first he did the usual over acting as if he‚Äôs happy, then a few minutes later he is bawling his eyes out. He says he doesn‚Äôt want to talk to us when his life isn‚Äôt going well. (He‚Äôs one of those people that wants everyone to believe his life is happy.) He basically told me he‚Äôs at the end of his rope, his wife convinced him that no one loves him, and he doesn‚Äôt care if he lives or dies. Being his daughter, this was hard to hear. But I listened and told him that he is loved by his kids unconditionally, and he doesn‚Äôt need to be perfect for us to care about him. We talked for over an hour, and it was mostly me listening to him cry, complain, and cry some more. I know it helped him a lot, because he doesn‚Äôt have anyone to talk to. And it felt good being there for him and having an impact on him. But it can take a toll on me. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want my dad to die, and I especially don‚Äôt want him to go out like this. Feeling lower than low, feeling pathetic and worthless. It‚Äôs really hard for me. There‚Äôs so much I want him to be around for. I just want him to be happy. It would sound ridiculous to anyone who knows him, but I do care about him. I wish things were different, and I wish I could articulate the complicated feelings I have. I just want him to be happy, safe, and healthy.

We've been together for almost 3 years, but we've been in a long-distance relationship for almost a year now and it just isn't working out. We've talked about this for months, and we even decided and followed through with concrete actions to make it better, but nothing has worked. We were just growing apart. I've been waiting for a better time to have that talk because he's been so down lately and it was just his birthday a few weeks ago. We actually decided to discuss our relationship on July 30 after giving the concrete actions some time to work/not work, so I have been waiting for that chance to be honest.

Today, he opened up to me that he's been feeling miserable about a lot of things. And he also told me that he's recently been thinking that he might want kids someday after all (note that I'm decidedly child-free, and so was he. In fact, I always bring up potential kids within the first few dates so as not to waste other people's time). This was definitely a lot for me to take in, but I decided not to kick him while he's down so I bit my tongue about this being an absolute deal-breaker for me. I just told him it's his decision to make, and I won't have him make that decision based on what I want because that wouldn't be fair to either of us and would only ever lead to guilt/resentment down the line.

Anyway, like I said, I didn't want to kick him while he's down so I said nothing about how I've been feeling, but **he chose to bring it up**. He said that we shouldn't wait to discuss our relationship and just have that talk today. I don't really want to lie to him about wanting to stay together, but I would also feel like such an asshole if I break up with him today while he's been feeling really terrible.

I really don't know what to do anymore...

**Update:** I did it. Or we did it. He actually brought it up. We're a mess right now, but it honestly feels like the right decision, and it went as well as I could ever hope. No ill feelings, still a lot of love and respect for the person, but the mutual understanding that our relationship has run its course.

453,caieju,tinyapartment123,My[F28] BF[M29] seems suspicious. What do you think?,"Hi guys. Sorry for my bad English.

My bf and i have been dating almost 2years now.

He has been dedicated and loyal to me.

Last year, I had to take a trip to LA to see my sick grandma, probably for the last time before she passes away.

We kept in touch during our trip and one day, he went out his coworkers to have drinks.

He drank so much and later text me this message out of nowhere.

""I'm never gonna go to brothel no matter how horny I am""

I asked him what he meant and he said 'You are everything I have and I'll never betray you.'

I didn't think of this as a big deal at that time because since  he talks in non-sense when he gets drunk.

I finished my trip and everything went good about a year.

And few months ago, I was helping him out with his phone and I saw the App History, (which apps you have been downloaded and removed)

He was onto something else and only I saw that he downloaded and removed 3 kind of brothel searching app. Not exactly ""prostitution"" but list of massage shops. (Prostitution is illegal in my country so they run hidden places where they can ask the owner privately for sex. Massage shops are one of them and my country has high rates of prostitution.)

I was so shocked by it and couldn't even bring it up. Suspecting from the apps he had installed before and after those apps, it was around the time I was in LA.

It got into my head so much and i couldn't think straight because I know he used to do one night stand (around 60\~70 girls). He used to say all he could think about was getting laid and took it as his pride back in his days.

And it was somehow brought it up during our fight when we were talking on the phone. I told him to check his phone history and he swears he has never betrayed me and doesn't know any prostitution apps.

He told me we should meet and talk, and when we met, I tried to show him the app history and it was gone. Even some of the apps he used with his exes.

I know what I saw because I can now even name those apps exactly, but he treated me like I saw something wrong. He told me if he were to search for prostitution, it's because of one of his coworker who always wants to go brothel whenever he's drunk. And he says he can't remember because he blacks out whenever he gets sh\*tfaced.

From the way he has been treating me from our first date, I think I can trust his words, he has been always honest and never got me worried with women. I saw him as a person who'd rather tell harsh truth than delusional lies.

But I'm now confused, not sure what to do and holding back my trust unlike before.

I feel like my sturdy trust in him is starting to crack.

Do you think he truly had nothing to do with apps and wanted to hide because it would cause nothing but fight?

If that's the case, I think I can somehow understand deleting apps he used with with exes .",2019-07-08 08:28:17,0,1,relationship_advice
454,caie98,salmaninay,"What to do when your crush orbits you, after telling her about your feelings for her?","So back in high school I had this big crush on this woman. But back then, my self esteem was so low that I never had the courage to talk to her. We barely talked over text, is was rather about school stuff or flat out ghosting.

2 years later, we ended up texting once in a while. Long story short, she forwarded a survey to complete, to all of her contacts, I replied ""Hey it's done, hope you're doing well."" expecting nothing as a reply, but she did and we ended up bonding a little bit.

Since we go to the same gym, we also met there twice and it went pretty good. By that I mean that I wasn't feeling awkward like I did back in high-school. But since she started working in her summer job, she stopped stopped going there.

I decided to ask her out by text. I wanted to go watch Toys Story 4 with her but she made up some reason to decline that. I suggested another movie, but she said she was gonna watch it with... her boyfriend.¬†

It felt painful. And it felt even MORE painful when her best friend told me that she lied and she ain't got no boyfriend at all.

Hence, I wanted to get done with this, so I sent her a pretty detailed text, telling her I got feelings for her. I wanted to cut all contact with her. My text ended with ""I wish I could show you how much I care for you"". I know, very cheesy. I wanted to move on after opening up to her.

It's been a week since then. She didn't reply, which isn't a problem, that's her wish (even though deep down I wish she did!). But ever since, when I post anything on social media, she likes that stuff. When it's about a song, a photo of me, anything.¬†

What bothers me is that she didn't even acknowledge the fact that I opened up to her by text, but still orbits me on social media.

Am I reading to much into this? Do you think I should unfollow/block her for a while to feel better and move on? What do you think?",2019-07-08 08:27:07,4,1,relationship_advice
455,caie10,strongpassword_,My (F/25) BF (M/28) still talks to his ex (F/27) who‚Äôs still in love with him.,"My boyfriend and I recently, as in last month, decided to make things official after talking for about six months. We had a long conversation about our ex‚Äôs, if we still talk to them/if we ended on good terms, and what we wanted from each other. He told me then that his most recent ex thought that they were getting back together (they broke up last September after dating a little under a year) and that she was still in love with him. 

First of all, I trust this guy. He‚Äôs never given me a reason to not trust him and I‚Äôve known him for the last three years. I know how committed he is when he‚Äôs in a relationship. Second of all, I know his ex went through some shit shortly after their break up and he helped her through that. I get it and respect that he was there for her. That was before we started talking and I can‚Äôt get mad about that. Hell, even if it started now I don‚Äôt think I could get mad. 

My issue is that she texts him and calls him. A lot. Even late at night when we‚Äôre hanging out (I‚Äôm talking 1:00-2:00 am). She knows that we‚Äôre together and has even said she hates me for it. 

How do I approach the conversation topic that it makes me uncomfortable without coming off as a controlling and jealous new girlfriend? I know she needs support in her life, but is it rude for me to ask him for her to find someone else to talk to? It‚Äôs getting to the point where I start to shut down a little bit every time I see him texting on his phone. I don‚Äôt want this to ruin our relationship, but I don‚Äôt think I can let this slide especially since she‚Äôs already expressed ill will towards our relationship. 

TL;DR: Ex girlfriend of new boyfriend talks to him way too much in my opinion. How do I gently tell him I want her to back off?",2019-07-08 08:26:15,4,1,relationship_advice
456,caidte,Cruise_confusion,My(f/35) husband (37) is going on a 7 day cruise by himself and I don't like it,"Ok my husband and I have been together for about 17 years and have children. We've gone through a lot of ups and downs together. But this situation really has me irritated. 

So his friend bought him a ticket to a cruise, which they discussed a few months back, and they were going to go together. I was unaware of any of this until a few weeks ago because my husband ""didn't think he'd actually buy the tickets"". The trip itself is in a week. I guess a few days ago his friend said he can no longer go but that my husband should still go because the tickets were already paid for. Again I didn't know this until I heard my husband discussing this with his brother on the phone yesterday. We have always had issues with his lack of communication and he just doesn't seem to get it or care enough to just tell me things. 

Now I was never really happy about this trip in the first place but now that he is going by himself... Just seems inappropriate for a married person to do. I have to take off work (he works days, I work part time some nights) to watch our baby and other older kids. He has to pay to get to the location the boat leaves from and back. So this trip is not free by any means, just the ticket. And we do not have a lot money at all. The money issue was my main concern, at first. Now that he is going by himself, my concern is his faithfulness. He's never cheated that I know of, though I have had my suspicions. With his lack of communication, how would I even know?? 

So now I feel like I'm in a lose/lose situation. If he goes, I will worry and stress about money and what exactly he is doing on the cruise. If he doesn't go, he will resent me for missing this trip. Also I feel like I'm a little jealous because since my youngest was born I haven't had a moment to myself while he hangs out with friends or plays basketball often. 

Help me reddit! How can I trust him? Is it normal to go trips like this by yourself while married? Any advice will help.

We've known each other for almost 5 years, both dated different people during that time.  All that said, I would say (and I think she would too) that we are probably one of each other's best friends, we know each other really well, we've had countless deep conversations, and I feel like we really vibe well together.  I really feel like I should pursue things further, but we haven't really explicitly talked about being in a relationship together, and lately we've been talking and spending time together outside our friend group, and I feel like the opportunity to make a move is showing itself.  I've always had a fear of reading too far into things, so I would hate to ask about a relationship when the feelings weren't as reciprocated as I thought.

Oh yeah, and I recently got a job that would send me off for six months and I have no way of knowing when or where I'd go (job's with a cruise line).  So that adds a whole new level of worries if we were to get into a relationship.

But I feel like if I don't take the chance now, the opportunity might pass me over.

458,caicwj,techflo,I'm in love with my common-law wife's older sister,"I've seen similar situations to this arise on this sub from time to time, usually with a younger sister.

I've had a crush on my common-law wife‚Äôs sister for the best part of 10 years. I've been with my wife for 14 of those years. Over the past six months my feelings for her older sister have increased to the point where I am now madly in love with her. Of course, my feelings for my wife have gone the other way, over a longer period of time.

I finally bit the bullet, and for better or worse and perhaps against my better judgement, I confronted the sister about my feelings for her. She was shocked and overwhelmed. I was, in fact shocked that she was shocked but there you go. Perhaps I am more subtle than I always thought.

As to be expected, the feelings I have for the sister are not reciprocated but she has been fairly good with me, offering me opportunities to talk with her about what I'm going through without disclosing my feelings to her sister. For now, at least. To make matters more difficult, the sister is going through a messy divorce and is currently living with us in our smallish two-bedroom apartment. 

We both know nothing can and will happen, but at the same time, I need help getting passed my emotions. I need guidance and some tips on how I can distract myself from these thoughts and fantasies. Yes, the attraction is sexual and the love I have is real. I am in no doubt about that.

In an ideal world, I would shut off these feelings for the sister and focus on the reasons why I have fallen out of love with my wife. But we don't live in an ideal world and I'm not sure I even want to continue with my relationship with her. I feel shame and guilt because I know she deserves much better than me. So does the sister for that matter.

Please help me find a way to get passed this torture.",2019-07-08 08:22:00,7,0,relationship_advice

460,caicnq,liam-e-james,Had a fight with my best friend and don't know what to do.,"My best friend (17M) and I (16M) got into a fight a few days ago. We have been close friends for nearly a year and most people would say we seemed inseparable. We would have lunch together everyday at school, we would text every single day, we enjoyed each others company. For the most part things were nice. There were some disagreements every once in a while, but nothing that wasn't normal for friends to do. There was a time where we argued and he left for a month, it ended in him coming back and us hugging and saying we missed each other. It sucked and caused me a lot of emotional pain but I moved past it you know? I was happy my best friend was back. Recently, as in about 3 days ago, we got into a fight. I ran away from my cousins house at night, I was walked around until morning so I could walk home or call someone. I didn't leave for no reason, I felt extremely unsafe and my cousins boyfriend was scary. He had been mad at my cousin and gotten agressive and tried to light fireworks to shoot at her. He broke up with her and left. She went after him things were fine. But he got scary again. I knew my cousin would be fine but I didn't think the same for me. I got scared and figured I would be safer outside. I am 16 and know my way around, I keep a knife on me, but I am on the smaller side which tends to make me an easy target. So when I told my best friend I was outside alone in the middle of the night he got worried. I explained everything to him and said I was in a safe neighborhood and that I was safer there. He demanded I go back. I said no an shrugged that off but then he was ordering me to because he ""said so"" and that meant I had no choice. He often acted like a parent protecting a child, and I do appreciate when he helps or when he is sweet enough to offer help. But this was just him not listening and ordering me to do things because he thought he had authority over me. I again repeated myself and said I was safer where I was and that I wouldn't go back. When it was aparent to him I wouldn't listen, he shifted to something else. He blamed me for why he couldn't help. He was saying it was my own fault he couldn't do anything. He said I wasn't trying and asked me what happened to trying to be a better person. This stung. He used that card for when I was slipping into depression and I was hurting myself. When I felt hopeless. I said I would try and be better, I promised. For him to use that on me for simply not listening when I was trying to keep myself safe, that hurt. I argued back with him but he was done. He said he couldn't deal with this anymore. My anxiety was bad and this was just making it spike up. He had left me before, for a long time, I fell into depression hard last time and I felt alone, people started leaving, my grades dropped. I couldn't go back to that. He knew I was breaking down and crying. But he left. We haven't spoken since. He didn't even check the next day to make sure I got home... He always checked in. It's been days and I am regretting the entire fight. But I don't know what to do... At first I felt strongly it wasn't my fault and he should apologize. But now I am unsure and I want this fight to be over. I want my friend back. Communication isn't something I am good at and I just have no idea what to do next. So what should I do?

464,cai9rw,123456-AI,My boyfriend [M29] is married and has three kids that I [F23] didn‚Äôt know about until yesterday,"Well... I‚Äôve always read posts here but never thought I‚Äôll be posting but here I am.
 PS: English is not my native language and I‚Äôm typing using my phone so I apologize for any mistakes. 
 The story might get long so TL;DR is in the bottom.
 In my work, I interact a lot with costumers a lot so one day during a conversation with one, I mentioned that I‚Äôve been waiting for Avengers Endgame since last year so obviously he offered to take me to watch it since we both are fans of the  MCU movies.
 We exchanged phone numbers and stayed in touch. 
 Days after days we would go out to places and meet nearly every single day he will drive me to work and pick me up, we eat together, we sleep together, he loved me as I've never been loved before.
 It was like a dream relationship ( almost too good to be true ) 
 The most perfect man I‚Äôve ever dated, we just click perfectly, all our interests and ideas and dreams are similar, in such a short time ( 3 months ) I started building castles on the clouds and imagining a life with him.
 The first of July came and he had to go back to the US since his deployment ended in this place. ( for anyone wondering, yes he works in the navy and on deployment and it is indeed a red flag but I was too happy and dumb to think )
Before leaving he got me a ring and said that this ring presents his promise of loving me forever and coming back to see me again, 
 After he left we stayed in touch calling and video chatting every day.
 Until the 6th of July I go to work as usual then I receive a call from him, I picked up thinking it was him until I hear a woman‚Äôs voice saying ‚ÄúHi! This is ***‚Äôs wife, did you know he‚Äôs married and we have kids ?‚Äù 
My heart just broke in million pieces. I didn‚Äôt know what to think, she then proceeded to say ‚Äú I‚Äôll wake him up so you can say your last Goodbyes ‚Äú 
I hear his voice say ‚Äú who‚Äôs this ?‚Äù Then the call hangs up. 
 I was shocked and couldn‚Äôt believe my ears , I called him again and demanded that he gives the phone to her , I talked to her and apologized saying I really didn‚Äôt  know he was married , she then told me how she used his fingerprint to unlock his phone while he was sleeping and how she read all the messages and saw our pictures then decided to call me . 
After that, she told me everything about their marriage and kids and how the youngest of their children were born just a few days before his deployment. I felt really bad and betrayed. 
The next day he texts me trying to explain himself saying his side of the story and how he wanted to tell me and couldn‚Äôt because he was afraid to lose me and their marriage was going to an end and that his wife was leaving him and asking for divorce,  saying that they got married because she got pregnant with their first daughter before marriage then a few months later she got pregnant again and things went downhill from there until she got pregnant again with their third baby,  nonetheless I didn‚Äôt believe anything he says I just want to stay away from all this . 
An hour later I receive a missed call and message saying ‚ÄúHey (me) it‚Äôs (the wife‚Äôs name ) can you give me a call please‚Äù
Then she calls again and keeps me on the phone for more than an hour and a half telling me how they met and how she was indeed asking for divorce but they got pregnant with the third child ‚Äúby accident ‚Äú so they decided to give it a try but after he traveled and came back he had different ideas, she said that me being a part of his life is fogging his vision and his love to me making him not think of their kids , she literally said ‚Äú the fact that he puts you above my kids infuriate me ‚Äú long sorry short she made him look like the bad guy even though he was next to her (in the background noise )telling her to stop lying to me, saying ‚Äú I told you I love her and she made me feel happy like I‚Äôve never felt before so stop saying lies ‚Äú 
Anyway, at that level, I was already feeling sick and tired of them so I hang up. 
Next day he called me after work to tell me how much he loves me and that everything we lived was his true self with me and that the marriage was going to an end anyway and he will support his children no matter what but he will never go back to her,
I know it easy to say just leave him but I really feel torn apart, I've been very firm saying that it's over and blocking him but deep down I say that if they got divorced then there is a chance for me to forgive him and start over just for the sake of the love we shared.
TL;DR: my boyfriend turned out to be married with 3 kids ( the oldest is 5 yo the youngest is 5 months old )  and still convincing me that they're getting divorced and he can't live without me.
But his wife thinks that his love to me is fogging is vision and doesn't let him think about what's good for the kids.",2019-07-08 08:09:31,8,0,relationship_advice

Before we could I was puking. He told the girls to basically butt out because he was going to take care of me. He took me to the bathroom and shut the door while I puked several more times.

Eventually when I feel a hand wrap around my penis I turned my brain on a little more and realized it was him. I froze and did nothing. After a couple of seconds he got brave and decided he was going to try to get me to do the same to him, and when he finally decided that he was going to make me stroke him I turned over and curled up into a ball pretending to be asleep. He tried on several occasions to flip me back over and to stick his hands back into my pants but I rolled up tight and wouldn‚Äôt let him. 

I told my girlfriend this morning what happened and neither of us know what to do. One way or another it is going to ruin her sisters life.

467,cai89z,IntegratedShadow,Our nanny's son (13M) is super horny and has been engaging in some deeply concerning behaviours.,"Ok, so some context. My wife and I both work full-time and have a 5 nights a week live-in nanny to help take care of our almost 3 year old boy. The nanny doesn't speak English, so she and I communicate little and mainly through mime, whenever my wife isn't available -we live in a South East Asian country, and my wife is a native. Our nanny has two boys, the oldest being 13, the younger I believe 11, as well as a girl about 16, and most of the time they live on the other side of the country with their grandmother. The nanny's husband lives and works in our city, so on her off nights that's where the nanny goes. Right now it's summer holidays and the boys are out of school, so are here in the city staying with their father.

The nanny's family are hardcore Christian, so I suspect that this boy hasn't been given any sex education. The entire subject is probably highly taboo. The family is also poor and from the countryside, and the boy doesn't even have a smart-phone, so no internet access and not a lot of opportunity to educate himself about the birds and the bees. I'd have thought that peers would have sorted that out but who knows. What is certain is that this kid is going through the horniest period of his life and it's manifesting itself in extremely troubling ways.

On one of her off-nights recently something happened. At her husband's place they all share a bed. In the night when I guess she appeared to be sleeping sufficiently deeply, her son started feeling her up. Grabbing the ol' boobie but not just that - trying to explore further down. The nanny was obviously freaked out by this but just kind of grunted in an attempt to scare him off without appearing to have woken.

She told her husband the next day, but he thought she was bullshitting or mistaken, that surely she was reading too much into an innocently misplaced hand during his sleep or something. He thought it was bullshit. Until a night when it was just him and the boy.

Turns out that wandering hand of his isn't just interested in exploring mama's nether regions. Perhaps in some way this boy is... exploring his origins? In any case, he tried to give ol' daddo a fondle and he dealt with it in much the same way by kind of grunting in a pretend-half-asleep way because what the fuck are you supposed to do in a situation like that?

I don't know whether the dad gave our nanny the apology she deserves for him not believing her.

It turns out he has tried the same with his younger brother. That brother is actually bigger than him though and shut that down hard.

I've told my wife to very forcefully lay out that this boy can't come around to our place while our boy is here. He has sometimes come round and occasionally stayed the night in the past. But even if the nanny were in the house, even if we were, there might be time when he and my boy were out of sight and there's no way I'm risking that.

So, that's where we are, and the nanny is going to be taking a month or two off to try and deal with this. And I asked my wife, how the hell is she planning on dealing with this? Nanny's got no clue. Something about praying. We've got a kid who likely doesn't understand the birds and the bees, doesn't even have access to porn which might be better than nothing, and he's gone so far as to grope and fondle his own parents and little brother. All within a hardcore Christian family that likely won't be amenable to.... I don't even know, some sort of suggestion that would otherwise, from a western and non-hardcore-Christian point of view, seem like the most reasonable.

After the drunken night we started hanging one on one more often . It was not suspicious because we were always close and would talk about all aspects of our life with each other. I though our drunken fling was a phase but my lust and desire continued and so did hers.


My friend has no idea and I have no intention to tell him of this incident or other incidents that have happened. Saying this may seem like a lie but I have no desire to hurt my friendship with him or her. I am aware that this is wrong but I do it anyways??

470,cai6sx,cantbearsed2,I left my girlfriend 3 weeks ago after years of struggling and met someone else and now my ex found out and is threatening me to leave our apartment and calling me a cheater. What do I do?," Hi Reddit

I was in a 11 years long relationship with my ex and I told her we were done around 3 weeks ago. Our relationship had slowly died over the last maybe 3-5 years, with little to no intimacy, barely any interaction but eating and watching some tv while eating dinner. We've been through a lot of problems where I had to be strong for her, it has slowly been sinking me down over the last year and I realized I had to stop this.

This thought has been recurring over the years but I was afraid of leaving her and how she would handle it, but it got especially strong over the last year. By sheer randomness, I started talking to a girl around a month ago and I noticed that I was starting to get feelings for her. I knew I wouldn't play my ex or the new girl, so I gathered my courage and decided to end my relationship and just see what would happen with the other girl. I also have to say all the problems in my relationship was hurting my job performance and social life so much that it was getting critical and a lack of sleep and mental energy was very draining. The girl I met was purely random and it just happened, she is not the reason I left, I did that for myself but she allowed me to find the courage and the strength needed to do it.

2 weeks later, still living with my ex because we have to get out of the apartment. She is planning on going to her parents all summer. This morning she looked at my phone and saw a message from the other girl and went crazy. She was leaving for work, but in the the next 20 minutes she went on how she wished me dead and how she hated being with me and that she hates herself for wasting all her life with me. She even threatened me to not be in the apartment when she comes home today or she'll be violent to me.

I would categorize her mental level as unstable, it could go either way and I don't really know what to do and how to handle the situation. My family all live a couple hours away and I don't want them coming here if the situation doesn't require it.

I feel our relationship has been dead for a long time, at least for more than 6 months with basically no interaction together, so that I decided to move on shouldn't be coming as a surprise. The only problem is that she is very dependable on me, she can hardly do much on her own and requires my assistance for many things and I've always done it in the last 11 years. I've offered all the help I could and to be there for her, but made clear I am not wishing our relationship to continue.

I start to be confused, she now accuse me of cheating and insinuating I've been with this girl for years with no evidence or reason for doing that. Also I've never been cheating or even considered it.

I ended the relationship and decided to just see where my new encounter would take me and it is developing and she saw that, am I wrong for seeking a new relationship after I broke with her?

She demands me out of the apartment, but it's both of us that rents it and I can't afford to stay elsewhere. Any idea of how to tackle the situation when she comes home?

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR

I broke up with my gf of 11 years after many years of her struggling with psychological problems she wouldn't get help for. I was not happy for years and decided to end it 3 weeks ago. I met someone else and allowed the relationship to develop after I ended my relationship with my ex and she is now going crazy at me calling me a cheater and threatening me to leave the apartment.",2019-07-08 07:57:58,24,2,relationship_advice
471,cai6q9,CodenameGunner,Still stuck in depression 2 years after breakup. Now having suicidal thoughts and giving up completely,"Short version minus all the details: 

I felt what it was like to love and be loved for the first time in my life. Relationship got complicated and we broke up. Tried to move on and keep myself busy with work, traveling (passion) and getting back into the dating world. Literally tried everything to move forward, didn't work. Life just got worse and worse as time went by. I keep consciously and unconsciously comparing other girls to her. 

LOOONG version with all the details:

A little about me, I was 23, male, and I lived the stereotypical Los Angeles life that everyone dreams about. I was a host at the biggest nightclub in LA. Partied every week, got paid lots of money, had access to almost everything/anyone, etc etc...

Eventually after a year of meaningless casual hookups, I got tired and bored of it all. I got bored of the women, got bored of the partying, got bored of it all. I finally decided to pursue my passion of traveling and that's where I met my first true love.

I traveled to Central London, England. I went there to go sight seeing and do basic tourist stuff. I also met up with a girl (not my love) I met over a year ago in London during a business trip. Let's call this girl ""Brittany"". So Brittany and I planned to meet up and we both bought tickets to do a bunch of stuff together. She decided to flake on me last minute due to some bullshit excuses. I got really pissed and decided to still proceed with my vacation because I didn't want to let her kill my mood.

After she told me she was gonna flake, it was really late. It was around 2AM and only one restaurant was open. It was a really upscale and expensive rooftop restaurant in London. I said fuck it I'm going. I don't care if it's expensive, I'm on vacation.

I went by myself, everything was super mellow as I was having my food. After 30 minutes go by a random girl decided to walk up to me and have a conversation with me. Let's call her ""Emma"" (my love)

Emma: You look familiar

Me: Uhhh I'm pretty sure you got the wrong guy, I'm not from this country

Emma: No no, I've seen you before. You're a promoter from LA

Me: Yeah I am holy shit, have we really met before?

Emma: Yeah I met you last year, you were in London last year

Me: Yes I was! It was brief though. Where did we meet?

Emma: I met you at the Vogue magazine Fall event last year

Me: Oh no sorry you got the wrong guy. 3/4 isn't bad though! I'm Sebastian, what's your name?

Emma: Emma :)

We proceed to have great banter, great chemistry throughout the whole night. We were just enjoying each other's company. We talked about each other's funny childhood stories, hobbies, funny stories, favorite movies, random shit, even Tekken the videogame.

Time goes by and a guy walks up to our table. He is actually Emma's boss. He offered to take Emma home, she politely declined because she said she wanted to stay with me. 

At this point it was almost 4AM.

Emma: It's getting late what do you plan on doing?

Me: I was just going to watch the sunrise on this rooftop since it's almost time

Emma: That's so beautiful, can I join you?

Me: You do whatever the hell you want

The waiter politely kicked us out the restaurant because they were setting up for breakfast. 

We leave the restaurant, one thing lead to another and she ended up back at my ABnB and we had sex like a couple of fertile rabbits for the entire night/morning.

A little bit about Emma. She was 19 at the time, valedictorian of King's College London, fashion model for Vogue Magazine, and her family is rich/powerful as hell, her dad is either VP or executive of Nivea and her uncle is an ambassador at the United Nations.

For the next couple of weeks we went on dates everyday and did everything together. We went to museums, restaurants, sightseeing, etc. We were madly in love with each other.

My vacation was coming to an end and had to go back to LA. Everything went downhill as soon as I went back to LA. She got in an accident and was hospitalized for a bit. During that time in the hospital she was very depressed but we still called each other every single day. 

Eventually she told me she didn't love me anymore. I was devastated and it was so sudden so I broke up with her. We decided to stop contacting each other as well. 

6 months later I was still heart broken and depressed. I randomly decided to contact her. We talked a lot and she opened up to me as to why she didn't love me anymore. She told me she didn't love herself and thought if she can't love herself then how is she able to love someone else. 
I asked her if I didn't leave you, would we still be together and would you give love another chance? She said yes..... And that devastated me even more because I felt like an absolute idiot for leaving her.
She told me she's in a new relationship and has a new life now so it be best if we permanently part ways. She said a part of her still loves me so we need to stop all contact so that she doesn't cheat on her new boyfriend.

I blame myself for leaving her. I blame myself for fucking up the relationship.

She raised to bar so high that I keep comparing other girls to her. Which I know is unfair, but sometimes I do it without even noticing it. I tried doing what I love most which is traveling. As happy as I get during my travels, once their over I go straight back into depression thinking about her. Same thing with my job, didn't matter how much money I made it didn't cover up the hole in my heart...",2019-07-08 07:57:38,0,1,relationship_advice

He‚Äôs really conflicted because he wants to help his mama, he does but we also have a family to care for now.

I brought it up to him about four hours ago, I texted him while he was at work to not answering for a bit wouldn‚Äôt have been a problem AT ALL.. had we not already been texting fluently beforehand.

Me and my wife have been together for nearly a decade and married for about 4 years. We separated for a couple of months about a year ago due to some big issues with us. I ended it because she was constantly telling me how I was wrong and needed to fix most of my personality basically wanting a new husband but didn't recognize what she did wrong. We got back together when she made what seemed like a big change in her life and I decided we could work it out. Now very recently she has begun to tell me in a very serious tone that she really hopes our kids are not like me and how she doesn't like x about my personality so I can't do that around our kids or give them hats or shoes because her family doesn't like it and it looks ""bad"". I am also severely depressed right now and I just feel like I'm alone and have to do it all on my own. I am also getting the feeling who I am is not good enough and won't be unless I give up who I am. The relationship overall is pretty good right now and I'm just wondering if it would be wrong to get a divorce because I don't think in the future we will agree with much of anything about kids and we both want them so much.",2019-07-08 07:41:33,5,1,relationship_advice
478,cai24a,driedmango11,Girl I really like but she just graduated,"Well I just found this subreddit and there‚Äôs some really messed up shit on here which makes me feel bad posting something like this but I need it off my chest so here it goes. I just finished my junior year in high school last month and the last 2 months of the year I met this girl in my anatomy class who I have developed a gigantic crush on but she just graduated and is going to college in the fall. Right now she‚Äôs on vacation and doesn‚Äôt come back until the end of the month but ever since school ended we‚Äôve been texting almost every day but I haven‚Äôt said anything about liking her. Towards the end of the school year I thought she liked me back but I‚Äôm not so sure now as the past week she‚Äôs taken a long time to respond to my texts even mid conversation. I‚Äôve heavily implied I want to hang with her when she gets back from vacation but she seems kinda uninterested every time. I may be vastly over thinking that because I tend to do that a lot but again I might not. I asked one of my really good friends for help and she said I might as well just tell her how I feel because if everything goes perfectly the college she‚Äôs going to is only like a 20 minute drive and worst case scenario she completely rejects me and I probably end up never seeing her again which is true but I am a gigantic pussy and every time I think about sending that text I never can actually do it. Obviously I‚Äôve liked girls before, but nothing like this. Half the day I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about her and I need to do something about it but I‚Äôm afraid if I tell her it will ruin the friendship we already have which I absolutely don‚Äôt want. Ever since summer started I‚Äôve thought about doing what my friend told me and that idea gets slightly more realistic every time especially these past few days but I still have a lot of doubts about doing it. I know most of the replies to this will be telling me to do what my friend told me to do because it‚Äôs most likely the best option but I need to do something about this because it‚Äôs starting to take up way too much of my head.",2019-07-08 07:39:36,4,1,relationship_advice
479,cai1ya,L3ah32,"Me (24F) and my fiancee (28M) are having issues with trust. How can I build up that trust to make our relationship work?[sorry this post is long, but I really needed to just spill my guts.]","So here is the back story of my life. I am Asian and throughout my life I had to live a ""secret"" life where I dated behind my parents back because of their strictness. I always try to please everyone and not focus on my own happiness even to the point where I felt depressed/suicidal. Even though my family and friends (so called friends) were making me feel like my own happiness is not important.  

&amp;#x200B;

Well I am engaged to a person who is a very blunt man. The first two months of our relationship, my friends were very opinionated about my relationship: how he is wrong for you, his comments are rude, are you sure you're making the right decisions, and etc... Me trying to please everyone, I was listening to their statements with a grain of salt. It gotten worse to the point where one of my ""best friends"" would make snarky comments towards us in front of our faces every time we all hang out. I got tired of her rude comments that I really had a talk with her that she needs to stop and tone it down. Me trying to please everyone, would tolerated her comments and try to make peace and excuses of her behavior. There are other friends who basically does not approve of my relationship. I was living with my friends that I know for almost ten years where my parents are letting us rent the house for cheap. When I told them after my miscarriage with my fiancee that I am planning to move out. Thats when my roommates started acting ""bitchy"" and literally telling me how I am selfish for only thinking about myself and how they know where they stand. (I did tell them that I was planning to leave sooner or later. It was just a month ahead.) Now we are not even in talking terms because of my decision of being happy and my future family. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for my fiancee, he has his own insecurities and a past where he was hurt and cheated on. Before we got together, I did not care much about him. I was indifferent, but as times goes on I started to realize how much I am starting to fall for him. We were dating (not boyfriend/girlfriend just talking) and someone from the past was there where I went on a date and mhm with. Well I did not tell him about it and always said that it was a friend date. I understand that I should've said the truth, but in my mentality before that all these lies with everyone is what I was accustomed too. I was so used to trying to live my secret life that I did not want to tell him about my past. The ones who I thought were ""friends"" from bumble or tinder that I still had on my social media were harmless. They're just there and I felt no different. After we got officially together (boyfriend/girlfriend), I had never cheated physically or emotionally through words or in person. I always stayed loyal to him even though I did not care as much in the beginning. I got so used to living my ""secret"" life that I was able to only care about myself. After a while, I started to care for him and stood up to my ""friends"" about how they need to tone it down and how he is going to be in my life. After everything, he found out about my ""secret"" life and was deciding to leave me. I know how stupid this sounds, but I want to live a life with him so I told him to take his revenge. He slept with someone in a matter of hours..After the crying, heartache, and disbelief we tried to make it work since we do love each other. However, we just hurt each other through our distrust. How can I move forward and build that trust again? Is it even worth it?

I found out a 3 weeks ago through a mutual friend that she has been cheating on me with a co-worker for about 2 months. I decided that for my revenge I would get what I never usually get, blowjobs. I thought she would be feeling extra guilty from the affair (since she actually had been acting sweeter than usual and saying yes to things more often) and my thoughts were correct.

I asked her to suck me off and not stop until I said to, and she agreed. She NEVER liked it while we were dating even though I always asked and was willing to reciprocate. She blew me for an hour or so today, and I was decently rough.

The past two weeks have been amazing sexually. Head was always my favorite thing and I gave that up for her. I‚Äôm getting it whenever I want, multiple times a day now. I can ask her to stop eating dinner and suck me off and she will do it. We have no kids yet so nothing to worry about there. 

I‚Äôve only told one friend about this and he thinks I‚Äôm disgusting for doing it. Shouldn‚Äôt I be the one getting all the sympathy? I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôll keep it going, but I‚Äôm sort of enjoying the rough revenge blowjobs for now.

My boyfriend and I just moved in together and have opposite schedules. He not only has a full time job working 7pm-7am 6 days every two weeks, but also has extra commitments that involve 5 24 hour shifts a month and some other misc things that are all about advancing in a super competitive field. In the meantime I work a day time job that can vary from 40-50 hours a week plus I‚Äôm going to grad school online. We live in an area with terrible traffic and commute one hour at least sometimes to work, in opposite directions, so rushing home for that overlap Is almost impossible. 

I‚Äôve been up all night reading all the tips and tricks for making time on opposite schedules. What I‚Äôm having trouble with after making what time we can I catch myself not being able to reconnect with him in that short time. It sometimes stresses me out more than not seeing him if it isn‚Äôt a positive experience. We actually did long distance in the beginning of the relationship and it felt easier than this. There was routine with communication then a lot of build up when we‚Äôd see eachother. Reading a lot of the info out there it validates a lot of the underlying feelings I‚Äôve been having but my main issue is getting all the emotional energy to make our time meaningful is too much some times.

I know it‚Äôs temporary. The goal is for me to finish grad school and him to have just one job in his field.

We were waiting to be seated, so we stood at the front for about 3 minutes. I was standing, looking at my phone, and when I looked up to observe the environment of the restaurant, I caught this waitress(Looked around my age and she was like 5'2) at the front looking at me with her head tilted slightly. I looked back down at my phone for another three seconds and when I looked back up, she was still staring,but looked away soon after. One thing that stood out to me was that my three buddies and I were standing together, but she was only looking at me. So it turns out one of my other friends was a waiter there as well. When both the waitress and my friend brought our food to the table, I told my friend with my deep ass voice ""I'm gonna give u a tip when we leave"" and she nervously and surprisingly asks me""What?"" even though I was not talking to her. Finally, when my friends and I are walking towards the exit in an orderly fashioned line, I try to look for her and I caught her already looking at me again as she walked by from a distance and she looked away quickly.

Fast forward 2 months, It's my sister's grade 8 graduation, it turns out that the waitress' younger brother is in my sister's class. After the ceremony ended, and all the families gathered in the hallway. I'm just standing in the hallway waiting for my sister and I see the waitress and her family walk past. She was already looking at me and when we made eye contact, she quickly looked away from me. I just wanted to know if all this means she thinks I'm attractive.

486,cahx46,yadonegoofed77,Recently started catching feelings for my best friend of 10 years,"You guys probably get these posts pretty often but hey, adding to the threads!! So my female bestfriend of 10 yrs and i have gotten really close recently given that we literally ended things off with our long term exes around the same time (about a year ago). We were supporting eachother and hung out pretty frequently; our break ups were not linked to eachother of any sort. I‚Äôve been having this ‚Äúis there more‚Äù feeling in my stomach for a couple of months now (2-3 months). We just came back from a camping trip with a couple of our friends this passed weekend and i‚Äôve been really feeling her ... a lot, but my dilemma is, do i shoot my shot or stay as friends?? During the camping trip, we started playfully wrestling n pinching and there were a couple of moments when we had those extremely strong and close up eye contacts but we just moved on and didn‚Äôt let that lead anywhere. I truly value the friendship her n i have and i don‚Äôt want to jeopardize that. Another thing is, she‚Äôs pretty tall 5‚Äô7‚Äù aka that‚Äôs my height (yes i know i‚Äôm short :/) and i know that‚Äôd bother her a lot. We‚Äôve had one of those agreements that if we‚Äôre single at 30 yrs old, we‚Äôll get married to each other LOL. We‚Äôre both on/off dating apps; well mostly her. I‚Äôm mehhh about those dating apps, they‚Äôre just so boring you know? And i don‚Äôt believe in actively looking for ‚Äúlove‚Äù. I‚Äôm more of a let love find me type of person but has ‚Äúlove‚Äù found me this time and it‚Äôs my bestfriend of 10 years???? She‚Äôs on/off those dating apps but has only been on one date and it went horrible. We were talking the whole time and called me right after the date ended. Okay that‚Äôs enough rambling, WHAT DO YOU THINK I SHOULD DO?",2019-07-08 07:22:11,4,1,relationship_advice

489,cahwr8,18416051872615638829,My (21M) ex (21F) is trying to get back at me with a fake post about me. How do I get this account taken down?,"I broke up with this girl, let‚Äôs call her X, 7 months ago. I recently found out that she had made an Instagram account, with a picture of me, and under the description she trashed me. 

I was only wit her for the short term investment. The only rewarding thing that came out of the relationship was her willingness to do sexually and emotionally satisfy me. The negative attributes of the relationship was that she had no social skills. She had trouble starting up and continuing conversations. She opened up a lot to me and had told me very-personal things about herself, and her last relationship. Her last ex dumped her the night he had taken her virginity, and left her outside alone. Also, about losing her friends, and not being able to openly talk to her family about her problems. She had a lot of issues to begin with, and seemed to really fall in love with me throughout our relationship. 

I‚Äôve been with my ex (current gf) for 4 years, which beats out being in relationship with X for 7 months. So, when my ex came running back to me 6 months ago, I obviously had to take her back. I was in love with my gf, and not X, but X was in love with me. 

In the post it implied I was a manipulating sociopath who mentally and sexually abused her. At the end of a date she was willing to have sex with me. After we would have sex she would have to walk back alone. I couldn‚Äôt drive her back, because I had to wake up early for school the next morning. Whenever she didn‚Äôt want to have sex with me, I would be upset, because that was the best part of the relationship, but she would give in anyways, even if it was one sided. 

I did have some feelings for her, but that was before my ex (current gf) came back into the picture. So this claim of mental and sexual abuse is a lie. She wouldn‚Äôt even have evidence to show it either. 

It is not my fault she fell in love with me and I had no intentions of feeling the same way. I saw our relationship short term when I had to choose between her and my current gf. When I had the opportunity to go back to my ex, who I was actually in love with, of course I dumped X to go with the one I actually loved. 

I did feel a little bad that I dumped her the way her first ex did, which was sleeping with her, then dumping her, and letting her walk home alone. But after she made that fake account trying to call me out I don‚Äôt feel bad for her. I want to move on with my girlfriend, and I don‚Äôt want this thing to suddenly come up again  in the future. I dumped X and I have no remorse, and my gf thinks I shouldn‚Äôt feel bad either. I don‚Äôt think I deserve hate for breaking up with someone I don‚Äôt love. 

How do I get this post taken down? I had many people report it already, but it is still up.

490,cahwr7,Phanteria,I (27F) felt trapped in a friendship with someone (30F) who had a lot of mental health issues and we went on a break but now she wants to be friends again.,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I'll be typing some background here so please bear with me. Also, mandatory ""I'm not a native english speaker"" disclaimer. This is very long, I apologise in advance.

I met this girl at work a few years ago. She told me she'd moved to the city some time ago to move in with her boyfriend and openly said she's eager to get some new friends. I have a boyfriend and a few very good friends, but outside of that I'm not a very social person. She and I are around same age though so I thought it'd be nice to have more people to hang around with, even if we didn't have that many things in common. She stopped working at that place because of personal reasons quite soon, but she wanted us to remain friends.

I don't know how to express it properly, but I feel like our ""friendship"" escalated fast. She was very fast to tell me about very personal things, such as how she has had a rough life and had to deal with abandonment from childhood and how she's struggling with mental illness problems she's seeing professionals for. Soon she started sending me messages and memes about friendship (memes as in pictures like ""we're best friends forever, you know too much"") and during all that I just kind of asked myself ""why?"" Because I didn't feel like such a special ""friend"", just a person who's hanging with her and listening to her. 

Within the year she got married to her boyfriend and asked me to be her bride's maid. I wasn't comfortable with that because I didn't feel we were that close. She was upset, but she didn't really end up having a traditional wedding anyway, just a close gathering with family and friends. Then after several months of fertility treatments, she got pregnant and asked me to be the godmother. I wasn't comfortable with that either and I told her I feel like she regards me as a closer friend than I am but eventually agreed because she said she wants her son to have reliable adults close by. I remember thinking ""why not, being with her is nice and it would be lovely to be some sort of influence on the next generation."" Because I'm not planning to have children myself

I just regret a lot of it. I'm thinking she asked me hoping we would become closer and hoping I would turn into the kind of friend she clearly wants. I've told her I'm introverted and my work is very irregular because of shift work (nursing, I know I said I'm not very social, but I'm good at that job so that's what I do), so I was content with seeing her a few times a month. Often when we met she said something along the lines of ""it's been such a long time! It's good to finally have you here"" or she'd talk to her few months old son like ""Here's Phanteria, your godmother! Do you remember her? It's been such a long while!"" I confronted her because it bothered me and I asked her not to use that kind of tone. I told her I understand that she gets lonely with her husband at work and staying home taking care of a baby but I know what my social limits are.

Between visiting each other, we texted a lot. On her bad days she sent me walls of text about her issues with her self destructive thoughts, issues with her own family and her husbands family and told me several times she's going to divorce her husband because of his family despite loving him a lot. Her abandonment issues lead to her feeling like why does she need to take care of her crying child when her mother abandoned her, which lead to the child being taken part time to a foster family, so his parents can recover. I replied to all of this sympathetically but also telling her that all of that is something she needs to go over with her therapist because it's very heavy. 

Then 7 months ago last year she was having a bad episode, sending me texts in the middle of the night and being upset I take hours to answer. Following day she sent a long message about how she fucks up all of her relationships with her mental illness problems but she's happy that she has me and that she's so glad we'll be friends forever.

That made me think long and hard of that relationship and what I'm getting out of it. I realized that her saying ""we'll be friends forever"" felt like I'm trapped and I felt just very tired of pushing myself to be there for her when I'm getting next to nothing in return, so I told her that. I probably picked the worst possible timing and she started telling me I'm a horrible friend for even thinking of abandoning her at her most vulnerable time, which I didn't really deny. There was some back and forth and the next day we talked it over on the phone. I told her that I'm just tired. I tried to be the kind of friend she wanted me to be but it made me dread seeing her again because I knew it wasn't enough. We eventually agreed to a break and cut contact.

&amp;#x200B;

And here comes the thing I need advice with. She sent me a message this morning ""Hey :) How are you doing? Have you thought about our situation at all? :) About us being friends?"" and I'm just spiraling. I'm going back and forth between ""Just talk to her, patch things up. You had good times too! You're essentially ghosting her."" and the fact that I've felt so much better these past 7 months because I haven't had to feel that pressure anymore. I realized I'm a lot happier without her but it's also making me feel really guilty. Should I just bite the bullet and see if she's changed? I feel like I'm being selfish and not fair for the child either who I promised to be a godmother to. I don't know how to respond to her. 

I'm really sorry for the wall of text, I thought I should make it more detailed to give a better grasp of the situation, and I suppose I felt the need to get it all out somehow, somewhere.",2019-07-08 07:20:52,4,1,relationship_advice
491,cahwlb,riconasty69,Future relationship or just another guy who doesn‚Äôt really care for me?,"So I‚Äôm currently ‚Äútalking‚Äù to a [23M] and I‚Äôm a [21F] and my dilemma is if I should continue pursuing him or dump him or another alternative perhaps? 

Some background on me: I was broken up in September of 2018 from a very intimate relationship of four years. (Rough I know) After lots of self pity and crying, I started dating again in November 2018. I went on casual dates and used tinder. Had a couple of one night stands and lots of meaningless sex that was just sex. To be honest, dating didn‚Äôt seem to be going as good as I hoped as a lot of the times, I genuinely felt empty about my interactions with other men. Maybe this had to do with being very intimate with someone exclusively for four years and then ripping it off like a band aid. But alas, I continued using apps and had a couple of dates to find my footing. 


I ended up meeting, let‚Äôs call him Danny, in December of 2018 off of Bumble. We later added each other on Snapchat and that was our main form of communication. We instantly hit it off and he was vacationing while we talked and everyday I would hear about his day and we‚Äôd get to know each other. This was very new to me as much of the men I had previously interacted with, I hardly got to really know besides one. After more talking, we found out we lived about an hour away from one another and started making plans to see each other at the beginning of the school year since we were both in college at the time. 

I want to be clear that I initiated a conversation about a date, but he seemed really into me and would compliment me on my looks and body. He would also compliment my interests and likes that we share similar political views. And while we talked, we also obviously kind of lusted at the idea of sex since it‚Äôs natural. 

Our first date came in January of 2019, about 3 weeks after we initially met. Our date was really affectionate. He immediately gave me a hug and a peck on the lips the first time I saw him. When we drove in his car, he put his hand on my knee and he also held me as we walked into the restaurant we chose to eat at. 
We definitely had sex after dinner and cuddled afterwards. We talked more as we cuddled and for the first time, I didn‚Äôt feel empty interacting with a male. I‚Äôm not sure if it was because I established a connection beforehand, but I definitely left feeling very happy and joyful as he was a sweetheart.

After our initial date, we continued talking and seeing one another. It was very blissful as most of our dates/hangouts were us getting food, watching a movie at his or my place and then being intimate. Our talks were pretty great in person and we‚Äôd casually send each other memes or political news when we weren‚Äôt seeing each other. Our talking through texting and social media was practically everyday. 

Now here‚Äôs where the dilemma is: While Danny is a very sweet guy, our routine changed. After March, we sparsely talked over social media, he would take hours to reply to me and his replies were kind of disingenuous. He would attribute this to him being busy with school as he‚Äôs a Data Analytics major and was his senior year. I was very understanding as I didn‚Äôt want to be the girl who needed him to text me 24/7 and I also am very independent and enjoy seclusion to an extent. And again, a very casual relationship that we established. His words being ‚ÄúI just want to take it as it comes‚Äù and I agreed as I wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship at the moment. 

We also saw each other less BUT, every time we saw each other, he was still very affectionate and sweet. He‚Äôll make jokes and was very talkative while we saw each other. He expressed how much he enjoyed seeing me and was again, showing lots of affection with no change since January. 

Now we are in July, and I‚Äôll be lucky if I get so much as a reply on the same day I send him a message. A lot of times, he‚Äôll leave me on delivered and just won‚Äôt really reply until the next day or two days. This is very frustrating to me because while I enjoy my own seclusion, I‚Äôve come to like his company and enjoy talking to him. But I feel as if I bother him if I so much as send a message as he just won‚Äôt really find the time to talk to me. It‚Äôs come to a point where I don‚Äôt even try to message him cause I know I won‚Äôt really get a reply. 

He also doesn‚Äôt message me first, ever I‚Äôve come to see. He did in the beginning, but now it‚Äôs always me reaching out to him. He has also never been the one to reach out to me to make plans. I have always reached out to him on what days work to see each other, I also am the one who goes to see him a lot, meaning I make the drive most of the time. 

BUT, I feel as if the only thing keeping me wanting him is the fact that even if our social media presence is kind of dead, our energy when we see each other isn‚Äôt. He is always excited to see me (to me) and is again, still very affectionate with kisses and cuddles. He‚Äôs even insinuated the fact that he‚Äôd like for me to sleep over (again) as I‚Äôve done it once before. He very much shows that he wants me when he sees me but he doesn‚Äôt when I try to message him. 

I have also confronted these conflicted feelings to him in a text as it reads:

Me: ‚ÄùHey, If you were no longer interested in me and talking to each other, you would tell me right?‚Äù

Danny: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just kind of a lot on my plate right now. The last couple days I‚Äôve been busy hanging out with my parents and my cousin had his wedding today or I would have texted you back. But in general I just have a lot going on with graduating and stuff and finding a job and then starting a new job once I do that. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm not interested in talking to you but I just don‚Äôt really feel like I have enough time and energy to spend on you as you deserve‚Äù.

Me: ‚ÄúI just sometimes can‚Äôt really tell. I get you‚Äôre busy, I‚Äôm really understanding about it, you know it. I just sometimes can‚Äôt really tell‚Äù.

Danny: ‚ÄúTalking everyday can be really hard for me to do‚Äù

So with all of this information, what should I do? Should I just dump the idea of spending energy on him if he has admitted he can‚Äôt find it to spend it on me to communicate when we aren‚Äôt seeing each other. Or should I continue in keeping my interest for the sole reason that he‚Äôs very different in person and very interested when we see each other in real life.

Is he really busy still or is he just blowing me off? But if he is blowing me off, why keep a interest in person? While we‚Äôve set a casual boundary, could I just be wanting more from him that he doesn‚Äôt want to give? Or rather, doesn‚Äôt seem interested enough in me to give?

I also want to add that he has established with me he‚Äôs not looking for a relationship at the moment as he wants to figure out his career before figuring out a relationship and that is okay with me as I feel as I am in no shape to be in one myself. Also he‚Äôs never been in a ‚Äúserious relationship‚Äù as I have. 

Please help me I‚Äôm so torn because he is the only guy I have found any interest in since my breakup and I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôm just making myself look like a fool chasing after him. I don‚Äôt want to be a clown girl.",2019-07-08 07:20:24,2,0,relationship_advice

494,cahvmk,mrspinguinita,How can I help him? Is he being unreasonable?,"My SO and me (both in our 20s) have been together for 4 years and living together for the past 2.5. 
Through our time together we have experienced problems like everyone else, mainly related to him not being very organized and tidy. I have come to terms with this for peace‚Äôs sake, in the sense that I do most of the housework. Just for context, I study from home and work part time which means I‚Äôm home most of the time. Some weeks of the year I‚Äôm pretty busy but for the most part I don‚Äôt mind doing most of the housework as I enjoy it to a point and I like things done in a particular way. 
My SO is extremely disorganized. He constantly misplaces and loses things like keys, wallet, work shoes, etc. He is the type of person that even when I have provided him with a place to leave everything when he gets home... he still manages to lose them. 
This morning he couldn‚Äôt find his wallet and woke me up at 7am (I normally wake up at 9am) to help him. We couldn‚Äôt find it, he got angry that he was going to be late and I ended up giving him ¬£20 for lunch and the like as he left without his wallet. 10 minutes later he calls me from the car saying that he left his work shoes at home. He ended up being 25‚Äô late to work, angry with himself and worried that it‚Äôs going to affect his work. 
This is all too familiar, it happens constantly. He has bad anxiety (that he refuses to accept or get treatment for), IBS (that obviously gets worse with these at least 3 times a week occurrences) and a bad temper. 
I just don‚Äôt know what else to do. I encourage him to get ready the night before, I tell him on the weekends to prepare, I have put designated baskets and trays for him to leave his stuff... he just ignores it or says something along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it later/tomorrow‚Äù and we start all over again.
In September I‚Äôm going to start a masters program that is very demanding and I‚Äôm not going to be home all the time, therefore all the cleaning, laundry and cooking are going to be a source of stress as it is, never mind with me having to manage his life too.
I love him dearly and we have an amazing relationship. But I am so worried about him. What can I do to help him? This situation is unsustainable for our future together (I don‚Äôt dare think what‚Äôs going to happen when we have children).",2019-07-08 07:17:15,1,1,relationship_advice

497,cahv6h,WhyNoFavor,"My [23F] boyfriend [28M] of 6 months told me that asking him to do things for me made him feel weird, what does this mean?","So I've been dating my boyfriend (let's call him Steve) for just over six months now. We were visiting some of his friends for the weekend and sleeping over.

We decided to head to bed a little early and I changed into my pyjamas in preparation of going to bed. They're a bit sheer so they're not something I'd feel comfortable wearing around Steve's friends. At this point, I realised I'd forgotten to fill my water bottle and, since the tap water wasn't drinkable, would need to go into the kitchen where Steve's friends were to fill it.

Steve was still in his clothing and I didn't want to get changed back into my clothes just for a quick trip downstairs so I asked Steve if he would go for me.

Steve said he'd rather not so I decided it wasn't worth getting changed and we got into bed. He then said that it made him feel weird when I asked him to do things like fill up my water when it's something I could just do myself.

I thanked him for letting me know it bothered him, but added that I didn't mind if he asked me to do things for him. He said that it was him who felt weird about it and that it went both ways so he'd rather not. I dropped the topic and we went to sleep.

However, it's been rolling around in my head all day today. I like doing things for Steve because I care about him and I want to make him happy. That's why I'm happy to do stuff if he asks me. I'm worried that this means he doesn't care about me the same way I do about him.

In addition, six months in, we haven't exchanged ""I love you""s yet. I find myself getting deeper and deeper feelings for him as time goes on, and I don't know if he feels the same way. I don't want to outright ask him because I don't want him to feel pressured or uncomfortable about it. Especially since he opened up and told me it was bothering him, which I appreciate. 

Obviously one of the things I'm going to do next is respect Steve's request and not ask him to do stuff like this for me anymore. But what else should I do? Do you think this means he doesn't care about me the way I do about him?

Edit: I explicitly told him why I was asking him to go when I did, so Steve fully knew it was because I didn't want to wear my pyjamas in front of company. I said something like ""Would you mind going to fill up my water bottle? I don't want to go in front of your friends in my pyjamas and I don't want to go get dressed again.""",2019-07-08 07:15:40,64,21,relationship_advice

So, first try and I fell flat to my face. I am still emotionally attached to my ex because of the illusions that I have managed to create over 1.5 months of relationship. I am still quite angry of myself because i saw red flags, but didn't broke it off until I couldn't handle the stress I was creating for myself. Yeah, guess I am a neurotic a little bit.

I go down on her regularly and we had all this intercourse meanwhile I had no idea she had a yeast infection. I want to confront her about how this is wrong. How should I do it?,"Hi everyone. I would just like to cut to the chase.

This weekend after our Fourth of July party my girlfriend and I were spending time with her family. 

Her sister, my GF (25F) and myself (22M) were just having casual convo joking around about the Fourth of July night. Then she accidentally or maybe thought it was funny to say that she recently had a Yeast infection. 

My response was ‚ÄúWhen? A month or so ago? since we‚Äôve been together?‚Äù

(We‚Äôve been together for 6 months.)

She said something like ‚ÄúYes, I asked Janet (her best friend) if I should ask you and she said Fuck no‚Äù Totally sounds likes something her best friend,  Janet, would tell my GF because she‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt give the best guy advice.

What I‚Äôm most disappointed about, is that I thought we established open communication. And then her friend gives her very poor advice not to tell me. 

That was an opportunity for my girlfriend to grow our relationship. I could care less about the Yeast infection. They come and go. Instead she hid it from me.

But to actually follow through on her friends advice Just seems so selfish of my GF to knowingly have sex with me and me perform oral sex on her while she had a Yeast infection.

500,cahuuw,duckslife,"one of my [17f] friends [18m] is in a relationship, yet very possessive of me.","for about a month and a half, this guy has been asking to hang out with me a lot, and since we're friends, i spent time with him. no problem right? wrong. he's in a relationship with this girl and he keeps telling me that he's going to break up with her, and he plans the day in his head but when the time comes he doesn't do it, and as of right now, still hasn't. also, whenever we hang out, he keeps it a secret from her, sending her black screens and saying he's busy doing chores, and he takes himself off the snapchat map. it makes me feel like a homewrecker!! i appreciate our friendship a lot, but he is oddly possessive of me. he is always checking/looking my phone when we're together and telling me he doesn't like my friends. he knows i like another boy, but i don't talk to him that often. but at this party he left his friends to come check on me, he didn't say anything to the group, yet sat super close and only spoke to me, and when he got up and left someone else at the table said he was staring at my phone the entire time he was next to me. i've noticed this before, but i am blind in one of my eyes so i didn't see it that night. it bothers me because he does this a lot in person and is always asking who i'm texting and sometimes what i'm saying. but he's always been like this. i don't know what to do about it because even when i turn my phone away or say something like ""don't worry about it""/""it's not important"" he continues to push. i can't tell if this is annoying to me because i'm short tempered or if this is an actual problem. or what i should do. 




TLDR: friend of mine is in a relationship, keeps secrets from her and has planned to break up with her for a month and hasn't yet. always looking at my phone and asking me who i'm talking to, and what i'm doing. also lowkey judging who i'm friends with.",2019-07-08 07:14:36,5,1,relationship_advice
501,cahu0e,10205836,"[18F] approaching the 1-year mark for my first big long term relationship, also moving out of my parents house and starting college, and I could use some general advice, as I have a lot bottled up.","Sorry this is long, I‚Äôve been thinking on it a while. _TLDR at the bottom._

So, everyone else I dated, it‚Äôs been 2-4 months max. But this guy, I really love him, he‚Äôs my best friend and so much more, first person I came out to, first I developed a relationship with their family, first person I ever was intimate with, and he‚Äôs just so kind, so caring... 

That said, I‚Äôve been feeling a lot bottled up lately, and just want to get all this dumb shit off my chest, and get some advice if there‚Äôs anything I can do to make things better. 

Guess ill start with the big-ish one: now that I‚Äôm 18, I kind of wanna post nudes, show off, get attention. Feel validated, feel like I‚Äôm not some chubby 6/10 fat sack of lard. Maybe even make some $$$ off of it for college and stuff. Is that cheating? I certainly want no other romantic relationship with someone else, I just want that attention, to feel like I‚Äôm worth something and attractive in a way. I mean I‚Äôve tried showing him some of the pics I‚Äôve taken for fun, and he‚Äôs never really that interested beyond wanting to look thru em real quick.. And maybe that‚Äôs unhealthy, trying to get self-worth from other‚Äôs validation rather than build confidence independently, I don‚Äôt know. But I wish I could at least try, see where it takes me. (Ofc I won‚Äôt without him being ok with it though, which I‚Äôm pretty sure he wouldn‚Äôt..) 

I also want to not always have to be the one being the life of the party. For him to be spontaneous every once in a while. Like the time we went hiking and to the water park and actually *did* stuff together better than just sit around and cuddle (not that I hate cuddling, but I sit around too often as it is... I want to feel alive). I want to talk about our hobbies and things we enjoy and be genuinely interested in them the way we were about music when we first met.. 

And damnit, I wish he could just express himself more, feel more beyond love for me as a person. Do not in any way get me wrong, im lucky he‚Äôs so head over heels for my personality and whatnot, it‚Äôs great to be loved for who I am (and I have not a doubt he does), but I also want to get him excited, or get excited with him. I mean he can get all lively sometimes, but it‚Äôs usually me initiating it. I get that becoming kind of numb/ more laid back is a good coping mechanism for other stuff, but I wish he could get more in touch with his emotions, feel more, think more.. 

Also, now that I‚Äôm moving out of my parent‚Äôs house into an apartment, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do. I‚Äôll have a private bedroom, but will have 2 roommates, would it be rude to have my boyfriend over/ have sex at my place? I‚Äôd keep it quiet of course if we did, I‚Äôm really shy, but I don‚Äôt wanna do anything weird by bringing him over, I mean it would be kind of obvious what we‚Äôre doin if they see him coming to my room and all...

On top of that, he‚Äôs not going to my school (he‚Äôll be like a half hour away), and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll fall for someone else. I get it, I‚Äôm young and I should explore; relationships at this age statistically aren‚Äôt likely to last to begin with, but I‚Äôm actually pretty damn happy in my relationship (even if it doesn‚Äôt come off that way in this post), and I‚Äôm kind of tired of the whole crushing and dating and breaking up drama. I like him, we‚Äôre good friends and partners, and I want to explore other stuff in life and get to come back to him at the end of the day. As it is, we‚Äôre planning to visit at least twice a month (plus video call) once school starts, and that honestly sounds fine to me. Is it bad to want to settle down and explore other things in life so young?..

&gt;TLDR; here‚Äôs my issues: 
1. Wanting to post nudes for confidence (and maybe money) when my boyfriend probably would be against it
2. Wanting him to be more spontaneous/express himself/ have more of a defined and confident personality maybe
3. Wondering if it‚Äôd be weird to have him over in my apartment to have sex in my private bedroom (quietly ofc) when I have 2 roommates 
4. Worrying I‚Äôll go back to getting crushes and dating drama since we‚Äôre going to different schools, when I really like this stability (as well as this guy) a lot

That‚Äôs about all on my mind, if anyone has advice on any of this I‚Äôd _seriously_ appreciate it",2019-07-08 07:11:52,1,1,relationship_advice
502,cahtzm,trowawayy2,My bf is talking with his ex,"His ex faked her death (she had cancer).

I moved with him from another country and after a year she called and he left to see her. I never felt comfortable. Then he started talking with another ex. I decided to go back to my country.

He begged I moved back. He stopped talking with the ex who faked her death because she protested that he had a new relationship. Two years latter he is still talking with his exs. I asked him to block one of them, he did it. On May the ex who faked her death came back, she said she dreamt with him and if I'm OK with them getting back in touch. I was NEVER ok with this.

He still has nudes and videos of them naked. I can see he checked them as soon as she wrote to him. Confronted him , he says he is not blocking her and that he may need her help one day. He has a thing on his hand and she studied medicine.

I asked why he checked her nudes, he said she asked him the photos. He gets too confrontational and says she is just a friend and she may need her help someday. He is not blocking her. I'm not comfortable with them talking. He always lies and says she is the one who texts him, I cam see he texts first. He always texts at night around 11-12pm or when I'm not with him and erases the conversations because I get mad, even if they are innocent conversations.

I want to leave, I feel guilty, maybe I am overreacting. Maybe I'm imposing him to stop communicating with her, I know I don't have the right, but I feel like he is not respecting me or our relationship. I tell him that I read from the situation that he prefers her, he says that if he wanted to be with her he would be with her and not me.

He says that since I won't drop the issue, he changed his mind and is no longer asking me to marry him. I just want to know if he really loves or cares about me. Am I being ungrateful? He has paid for me to live with him and my college, he buys special treats for me. I feel like I am playing the victim and maybe I'm not?

504,cahtav,eggplants_sour,I (23M) am having conflict with breaking up with (24F) gf,"So previously, saw my gf and her guy friend outside her house when she texted she was alone. Following she lied to me about the details when i saw what has happened. (Nothing serious indicating that she cheated but just that she lied) She says that he is only a good friend but avoids explaining what is going on when i asked her.

I ghosted her for a few hours to get my thoughts together and reprimanded her for making me lose my trust in her. She replied trust to her was the most important and apologized, and just left things without reconciliation.  So i do not know if she intends to just end thing as it is, as she said she wanted time to collect her thoughts. 

The thing is despite all her dishonesty about the guy, i want to give her another chance. As a part of me felt like i was overreacting. I am going through a hard time trying to picture a future without her and it is all too much pain now. That it is affecting my productivity. I know i should end this relationship but my heart cannot take this damage right now. But signs point towards her wanting to end things too. What should i do now? I really cannot be out of commission due to emotional issues in the coming months. Should i choose to hang on to this relationship hoping things will be better after we talked hopefully soon. 

TL;DR: Going to have the talk with gf soon, still having conflicts on whether to kill it despite all the dishonesty i wanted to forgive her and hope things can improve. As i cannot handle the emotional trauma right now in the coming months.",2019-07-08 07:09:25,0,2,relationship_advice

508,cahs0m,SubatomicNick,I [M/22] found out my (now ex) girlfriend [F/20] cheated on me with someone who has a criminal history and they are now dating. I don‚Äôt want my son around her boyfriend and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever be able to forgive her.,"Alright, so we started dating almost 2 years ago. 2 months into the relationship she got pregnant and we decided to keep it. At the time I was 20 and she was 18 and it was very difficult for both of us. Fast forward to last March and we mutually decided to break up and co-parent. Very quickly I regretted the decision and attempted to get back together multiple times but she said no each time, saying she wanted to be alone and focus on herself and our son. After a couple months we started becoming closer and doing more things with our son and I thought there was a good chance we‚Äôd get back together. But there was this one guy I kept asking her about because I had a feeling in my gut that something was going on with them. So one day she was over and I made the mistake of going through her phone and finding out she had been dating this guy [20] and lying to me about it. I then proceeded to find out that she also cheated on me with him. We had a long talk that consisted of her saying sorry multiple times and saying how she enjoyed how things were between us and that it was like we were taking things slow. But I didn‚Äôt get the feeling of her actually being sorry, especially since she‚Äôs still with the guy. The next day I found out he has two warrants out for his arrest and is supposedly going to turn himself in next week and is going to be gone for possibly up to a year. She plans on staying with him while he‚Äôs in jail. She used to be a completely different person and now I don‚Äôt know who she is anymore.  I don‚Äôt want my son around her boyfriend and I don‚Äôt know what to do about it. They currently aren‚Äôt living together but they‚Äôre talking about it. I also still want to be with her so we can be a family but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever be able to forgive her for this or trust her, or honestly if it‚Äôs even worth it.",2019-07-08 07:05:13,2,1,relationship_advice
509,cahrrq,CowCom,I haven‚Äôt been hurt this bad in a long long time. What should I do?,"I had been talking to this girl for a little while and we began to get closer (Let‚Äôs cal her girl A). I wasn‚Äôt attracted to her but apparently she really liked me, and one night she FaceTimed me with one of her friends(we‚Äôll call her Girl B). That night I talked to both of them for like 6 hours and I became interested in her friend.

A few days later girl B snapped me saying I should date her friend and I said I don‚Äôt know if I actually like her. And we talked about that until our conversation switched focus onto her and I, and we began sending some sexual pictures and talking about  possibly having sex.

I was incredibly excited since the girl I started to become interested in had decided she liked me enough to have sex. And since I‚Äôm a 15 year old boy fucked up on hormones this was like a dream come true. 

And this excitement lasted for days, we would talk about when we were gonna meet up and what we were gonna do. And I started to like her more and more. I felt a connection with her from before we even spoke about sex, and that too was going to happen. Those were some of the most exciting days I‚Äôve experienced. 

But it changed one day when she texted me saying that she felt terrible about how she betrayed her friend that likes me. Since I didn‚Äôt want to be a bad person I didn‚Äôt force her to stay with me or make her forget about her loyalty to her friends. So I said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to be with me if you don‚Äôt want to betray your friend, but I do like you.‚Äù She seemed so grateful and asked for a day to think it through. 

The whole night I thought about that possibility that I could still be with her, but I knew deep down and I always knew deep down that the whole situation was to good to be true. The next morning she left me. 

That day I ignored my feelings and hung out with some of my friends. But at some point I started to think about the past few days and I started to get sad. Eventually I went home with two of my close friends and they comforted me while I cried for the first time since 6th grade. we stayed up all night talking about my problem and they related to me with their problems. And it helped.

The next morning another one of my friends said he was gonna text her to see what was going on. And reported to me that she still really likes me. And that she will try again when her friend isn‚Äôt in love with me. 

I‚Äôm not sure if she will come back to me. And if she does I‚Äôm not sure if I should go back to her. I‚Äôm mad that she didn‚Äôt think the situation through and just not talk to me in the first place, sparing my feelings. 

I can‚Äôt remember a time when I was this sad. I stopped working out which is my number one passion, I don‚Äôt seem to be very hungry anymore, and I don‚Äôt know when this will end. 

Should I stay friends with her?
Should I take her back if she wants in the future?
Or should I never talk to her again?",2019-07-08 07:04:17,1,1,relationship_advice
510,cahrp1,cloudyhazed,I‚Äôm sick,"21F. 
My boyfriend and I dated for almost 1yr. I always had paranoia about him going back to his ex (he brings her up sometimes but not a lot, but i‚Äôve always felt like i wasn‚Äôt as good enough as her?). He has made comments in the past that he finds her sexually attractive, but I don‚Äôt know if i should‚Äôve taken them as red flags or not. he treated me good, it was really only the ex thing that was getting to me sometimes. Anyway things were great and i don‚Äôt know if i asked or if he brought it up but his ex was snap chatting him again. i‚Äôve explained to him several times, even in the beginning before we dated, that i don‚Äôt do this ex bullshit and i kept asking him if he still had lingering feelings but  he always denied. I told him before we started dating so many times, but I guess u can‚Äôt predict what will happen in a year. Things started getting rough about 11 months in and i told him to delete her off his snapchat, i hated doing this because i didn‚Äôt want to be controlling, i was kind of hoping he would just do it on his own. i was hoping he could see my side to things, and that he cared about me and the relationship, or was more reassuring? but it seemed like he was defending a girl that he claimed to hate and only associated negative feelings with more than hearing me out. Soon after, he said he wanted to go on a break and that he‚Äôs been feeling strange lately (for the past few weeks), doesn‚Äôt feels like he loves me as much as he did in the beginning and that it doesn‚Äôt have to do with this situation with his ex. ok sure. few days later i call him up, ask him if he‚Äôs been getting w people and it took him an hour of lying to admit he was getting with his ex who has just gotten out of a relationship as well. He told me he did it because of my ‚Äúaccusations‚Äù and that it felt safe or comforting to be with her. Im sick. i don‚Äôt know if i sound crazy but idk about y‚Äôall but i wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable with my SO receiving messages from the ex they ‚Äúhated‚Äù and subtly continuing communication. And after continuously bringing it up and having your SO make u believe they do value ur perspective. I‚Äôm sick to my stomach, he was with her the day after we went on a ‚Äúbreak.‚Äù when i found out that he was seeing other people i was going to break up with him regardless, but finding out it was his ex is bringing out a different type of pain in me. it‚Äôs hard to eat, sleep, i can‚Äôt stomach anything down thinking about them together. she knew we were in a relationship too. i know his family too. i‚Äôve blocked him and her on everything pretty much, wrote a nasty message and blocked his number for my own sort of peace. if he wants to reach me, he can find a way, but everything about him is making me very sick and sad. It wasn‚Äôt always like this, but recently it‚Äôs been a little off, I knew things weren‚Äôt the best but i didn‚Äôt think things would be over. And now, i am the ex thats cutting communication, funny how these things work. what do u guys think about this?",2019-07-08 07:04:03,12,1,relationship_advice
511,cahrf4,Etheral_101,I (15M) am uncomfortable with how my sister (12F) is acting. How do I approach this in a way that won't ruin our relationship?,"I started feeling uncomfortable a couple of months ago but looking back the behavior started when she was about 8. Me and my sister live in different households due to us both being adopted by different people. We both live in the same state and we meet up a couple of times a year (couple of times a month if both of our family's schedules are empty and convenient). Sometimes we would meet up at their house, a restaurant or our house.

&amp;#x200B;

 When this all started I barely noticed it. I think the first time I really felt something was wrong was when at my house when I was 13 and she was 10, they let her stay the night because their biological son had a basketball game and she didn't want to go. She was sleeping in my bed and I was sleeping on the couch in the living room. I was watching TV and she walks in saying she's scared of the dark and I knew she wasn't since she could watch horror movies without flinching or complaining. Of course I offered to turn a light on or watch her until she fell asleep but she answered saying that she wanted me to lay in the bed with her. I oblige since that seemed the brotherly and kind thing to do and I was tired anyways so I get in bed with her. When I woke up the next morning she was clinging onto me and when I tried to get away she would cling on with a grip of steel. I eventually got away and I found out that her family was already in the kitchen eating breakfast with my mother. They said that they saw us sleeping together and ""how adorable it was"".

&amp;#x200B;

 Since then the behavior has already gotten worse. She insists on sitting on my lap when we meet up and she wants to eat out of my plate at restaurants. What also bothers me is that her family seems to not even notice the behavior and seemed to be encouraging it saying ""how cute and wholesome it was that we were bonding"".

&amp;#x200B;

 What really got me thinking about this whole ordeal is that about a couple of weeks ago and it was just us both and both of our mothers at a pizza place (forgot the name). They said that they were going to talk about their jobs and schedules together and that we could both sit at a booth somewhere and order before they got to where we were at. When we eventually found one in the corner she sat next to me. We started having a conversation about how we were doing in school before it got released and how life was for each other. She started going on about how she wishes that we could live together so that she can be closer with me. I shrugged it off at first but then later she starts trying to nudge closer to me and sit on my lap again. I of course shut it down and then she starts complaining and states ""her sitting on my lap should be common place for us"".

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if i'm over reacting or if it's just my over active imagination or me jumping to conclusions to quickly. Both of our family's were planning a trip to Washington D.C in a couple of weeks before school starts again and I really want to get this solved before then if possible. How do I solve this without damaging our relationship?",2019-07-08 07:03:05,2,1,relationship_advice
512,cahqpn,broken-glass-kids,I (25F) accidentally made my friend (22F) hate me. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth trying to fix our friendship.,"So I have this friend, let‚Äôs call her A. About 6 months ago A tried to kill herself. Since then me and our other friends have been very supportive of her since she seems to be extra sensitive to things now. We always do what she wants to do. We hang out when she wants to hang out. And so on. And I don‚Äôt mind because I know she‚Äôs going through a rough time. But it‚Äôs started to become more like she expects people to do things for her. 

So here comes the part where we fought. A went on a vacation and wasn‚Äôt going to have a job when she came back. She asked me to ask my boss if he would hire her. This would be beneficial for A because she does not have a car and I could drive her to work. I asked my boss if we were hiring and he said no so when A got back from her vacation I let her know. A was instantly frustrated and asked me to ask my boss again and put in a good word for her and I said no because he already said we weren‚Äôt hiring and I didn‚Äôt think it would be professional to keep bugging him. A then proceeded to complain about how she didn‚Äôt know how she was going to pay her bills, which is understandable. What‚Äôs not understandable is A lives in a two bedroom apartment by herself and refuses to get a roommate to help with bills because she doesn‚Äôt believe she‚Äôll get along with anyone as a roommate. 

So A continues to complain and I kind of just snap. I tell her that she shouldn‚Äôt have gone on an expensive vacation without a job lined up for when she came back and it‚Äôs not my responsibility to find a job for her. I told her she needed to start acting like a real adult and she‚Äôs gonna have to face the fact that she can‚Äôt afford her lifestyle anymore now that her parents aren‚Äôt helping her pay her bills (she just graduated college so they cut her off). A told me I was being extremely insensitive and to not talk to her. 

About a week goes by and she finally texts me asking if I want to hang out on the weekend. Me being the mature adult that I am (sarcasm) responded with ‚Äúoh so you‚Äôre talking to me again?‚Äù And I haven‚Äôt heard anything from her again. 

We‚Äôve been friends for a while but honestly it‚Äôs starting to feel like she wants people to do things for her and she wants to be the victim. I just don‚Äôt know if I want to be friends with someone like that. But I don‚Äôt have hardly any other friends and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth throwing away a friendship over something so small. But I also don‚Äôt want to have to keep constantly monitoring what I say because I feel like I should be able to be honest with my friends. 

I guess the advice I‚Äôm looking for is am I being an idiot for not trying to fix our friendship? It was just a small fight so idk. Thanks for reading.",2019-07-08 07:00:50,4,2,relationship_advice

However, my boyfriend (21M) really wants kids, like as strongly as I don‚Äôt want them. Obviously, someone‚Äôs gotta give. Breaking up is not something I‚Äôm going to personally consider. 

In my opinion, I feel like the childfree person would be giving up A LOT more to make themselves go through with the effort and commitment of having kids than the child-desiring person would have to go through by simply living life as they always have and forego having kids. But with that said, I might be the one having to compromise. Curious to see how others have tackled this.",2019-07-08 06:59:45,10,0,relationship_advice

I fear this situation is the reason why I have been thinking of my first love. Somewhere deep in my heart I still feel my first love is the love of my life and I could never stop loving her.

I don't know what to do. My first love unblocked me on Facebook and that just made it worse. All the questions like why now and why doesn't she talk to me after unblocking me, or whatever. I feel guilty about my current relationship because this is the woman that brought me up to where I am but I just don't feel that I will ever love her in the best way I know how and I know I won't be as happy as I would be with my first love.

516,cahpm5,navojski,I (26m) broke it off with my gf (22f) - when love is not enough,"Dear Redditors,   


For the past 10 months I've been together with my gf whom i'll address as ""Kat"" onwards, name is changed as she browses reddit, though I'm confident she isn't on this subreddit.  


Kat is an introverted type of a girl with a wild persona within that reclusion  of introversion. Artistically talented, though a IT student

I'm a sellout of my dreams employed IT engineer.  


She was first girl in a while I cared for in a long time, and while I was not her first serious relationship, I was first somewhat functiaonlly healthy relationship  


With me myself being a bit introverted, we've spent lots of time creating our own world, one filled with care and love.  


Somewhere along the path, we've became rotten (or we always were), kinda controlling, in a way that both parties would have a fear to express some parts (nothing too major, small things add up though) of themselves.  


Whenever I tried putting some space recently between for the sake of healthiness of the relationship, the natural go to reactions of Kat were to get scared or assume she has done something wrong. She would react a bit passive-agressive or say something along the lines what i think is guilt tripping :

""okay, i'll give you the distance even though it might not be good for us""

 which would make me feel like an ass for asking something that is for my sake of mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Mind you, I'm far from ideal, have passive agressive moments somewhat as well and can be very rationally cold to handle things. In most  cases I could see what she was saying and explain to her why thats not okay and should would be able to understand quickly.  


The distance would be nothing major, something like ""we,ve just spent the night and morning together, i want to do something else by myself today""  


And needed so, to explain further 'cause Kats dad has been diagnosed with cancer, and her best friend gfs dad had very recently passed away from cancer.  


We've had numerous talks, the diagnosis is in itself one of the scariest thing happened to her, due to her extreme close relationship with her father.  


I've held her for numerous nights of crying, and think the situation is unfair for her faimly.  


Naturally the care shifted towards her.  


Though in the past month more time was spent arguing and being ""okay"" than generally nice or deary moments.  


I became feeling trapped within all this, decaying with my mental health, that I cannot help anyone if I'm not okay with myself first and foremost.  


I became feeling somewhat anxious to plans with her, as I've known I or ""we"" were one of the only bright lights in her life.  


My problems are nothing of those magnitude, am somewhat bipolar and can feel out of nowhere like I have no real happiness in this world, my whole rational outlook shifts and gets shat on by irrationality.  


I assume I gave myself the anxiety from ""your shit isnt a bad you cant rly complain""  


Upon the day of her bff father passing, I selfishly could not deal with her and all that. We had a big fight, dramatic words were said on her part, which I recognized for what they were, dramatic words, something she didn't really mean, though was dissapointed she would react and say all those things one my 1st time of drawing the line in not being able to be there for her, cause i wanted too look after myself first.  


The following day, we met and I broke up, in a very rational cold manner.  


Day after we met in a concert, and I approached her to talk, due to feeling sorry and like an ass cause she did not deserve such a cold approach, me acting like that due to not knowing how else to handle it.  
Fast forward few hrs of her being late for public transport and sleeping over (i live 20minutes away, she lives 1.5 hrs away) of the sweetest night.  


I reassured her that she should not blame herself, I do not hate her, I never did, for all fuck ups it requires two people.  


She understood it, somewhat, though still being majorly sad that we'll never be doing some of our things again.  


Feel like love was not enough for us, that we would become more and more toxic towards each other until we hated each other.  


Of course, feelings are somewhat tricky and minds are stupid, that in past 24 hrs i've just felt sad, sad in a way that im thinking I made a mistake, question whether were things that unfixable?  


My main question (for those of you that reached the end of this post) is this :  


I do not want her to be alone and feeling lonely in the upcoming period with her father.   
She doesnt open up with her mother and brother, rather suffers in silence within herself.  


Is it possible to in a way still be there for her as a friend?  


Did I save ourselves in a separate way?   


Did I destroy us in a separate way?

519,caho3y,NotATumblrFuck,Choosing between two potential partners?,"I am 21F &amp; there are two men in my life who both want to be in a committed relationship with me. However I am having trouble committing because I am scared of choosing someone that will not live up to my expectations. What I want out of a relationship is a life partner I can grow &amp; share experiences with easily (looking for a compatible partner) &amp; I think it‚Äôs important to discuss my expectations for a relationship prior to diving into the situation so that my expectations can be compared to what each man can/does offer. I do not expect happiness 24/7 in a relationship because only I am responsible for my own happiness, however I would like to share my life &amp; create memories with someone special. 

Man 1 (22M): He &amp; I have previously dated for almost 4 years. Although we were dating for an extended period of time we have broken up twice due to a variety of reasons but ultimately it boiled down to his substance abuse which contributed to his inability to take on responsibility. In our relationship I supported him emotionally &amp; many times financially due to inabilities &amp; poor mental health (he was orphaned at a young age. Not an excuse for actions but for background information as to why he was abusing &amp; suffered mentally). Throughout the duration of our relationship there were a multitude of times I felt ignored &amp; unloved because of his inability to keep promises &amp; neglectful nature due to his substance abuse. I expressed how i felt &amp; nothing changed (this is why we broke up the first time). Subsequently when we got back together things still did not improve (this is why we broke up again). However when we first began dating &amp; even now the chemistry between us is undeniable. There has been no one in my life that I have loved in the same capacity &amp; when things are good between us it‚Äôs everything i have wanted in a relationship. He understands me on a deep level &amp; we have similar personalities so we click very well. In recent months he has quit using &amp; seems to be on the right track for taking on responsibility &amp; growing into an adult. However I am wary to jump back into our relationship because I am scared his true nature will come out &amp; I will once again have to be the sole provider in our relationship. In addition my family loves him &amp; does not know the extent of emotional trauma I had to endure so they are all a proponent of us rekindling our relationship. (This tidbit is important because I am extremely family oriented)

Man 2 (22M): Him &amp; I were originally coworkers but decided to try dating once Man 1 &amp; I broke up the second time. However in the process of casually seeing one another we decided to be exclusive for almost 3 months. The initial ‚Äúspark‚Äù was not there between us because we can both be very awkward &amp; shy amongst other things so our chemistry although not initial did eventually grow. During our relationship he consistently showered me with affection, affirmation of his feelings, &amp; consistently displayed his ability to maintain responsibility. I never felt ignored or neglected during our time together. Whenever I told him I had a problem with something he would immediately change his behavior &amp; insisted we talk about our issues to make our relationship better. However we are drastically different personality wise &amp; at times his quirks annoy me. For instance his need to be at home &amp; alone all the time while I am a huge social creature amongst my friends (minute point here, but an example of us being polar opposites.) Further the feeling of deep love I felt with Man 1 simply does not exist in this relationship. Which is why I am hesitant to jump back into this relationship because I‚Äôm wondering if a lack of spark means we are incompatible? Do these personality differences really make or break a relationship? My family is not a huge fan of Man 2 because of their loyalty &amp; love being with Man 1. 

What I‚Äôm asking is should I give Man 1 another chance &amp; ignore my hesitance or should I overlook our opposing personalities &amp; give Man 2 a shot?",2019-07-08 06:51:37,6,2,relationship_advice

524,cahmj2,AvatarFangirl95,[23/f] I think my boyfriend (19/m) might be cheating. But am i just jumping to conclusions?,"Hey, so...i don't want to sound like a crazy person or anything, or be one of those girls who accuses her boyfriend of cheating at the drop of a hat, but i do think he is. With my mom. 

Here's what happened. A few weeks ago, i was visiting her for her birthday. I had him drive me since my car was in the shop. I introduced him and they talked for a bit, just introductory stuff. She asked about his grades, his job, family, you know.  The car ride back home, he seemed so preoccupied. He barely spoke a word to me, he asked a few questions about mom. He seemed particularly interested in asking where my dad was and the divorce. But, other then that, nothing. 

Now, my mom is recently divorced and single. She is pretty, but i really hope she wouldn't be doing this. And my bf, he's kind of a horn dog. He's always groping me and trying to get me in bed, like, every hour of the day. . Over time, since then, he's had less interest in our intimate time together. He's spent a lot of time on his phone. He won't let me see what he's doing or anything. 

There was a couple times, we'd be driving and he'd mention ""Hey, since we're in town, wanna drop by your mom's?"". For no reason.

This morning, he finally got his hair cut. (He's had, kind of, long hair. But, after a few weeks of pushing him, i got him to cut it into a more respectable style. For his upcoming job interview). We were in the area and decided to visit her again. She seemed happy to see us. We talked for a long time, at least over an hour. One thing she said was about his haircut, she just pointed it out and it looks different, i explained it to her and she said ""Oh, well you look very handsome that way"". 

When we left, i had to beg him to leave. I kept trying to remind him about somewhere we had to be that afternoon. But he got annoyed ""I'm in the middle of a conversation. Stop being pushy."". And we walked out the door, mom told him ""Oh, she's always been pushy,"" then nshe told an embarrassing story from when i was a kid.

Now, the last crucial piece of evidence that set this whole thing in motion. I had already went and got in his car. But i noticed he didn't follow me. I looked back and he's hugging her. That's not all, his hands were kind of low. Like, on her lower back. It got me to thinking and it made feel start to worry that he's cheating on me with her.

But i just don't have that high of a libido. I hope he's not doing this too me. 

But, i don't want to sound like a crazy person and accuse him right off the bat. I mean, they seem awfully chummy. Am i justified for thinking this? Or am i just being overprotective?",2019-07-08 06:46:19,14,18,relationship_advice

I still have not totally gotten over it and secretly want to be with someone more like my ex. New boyfriend is quite opposite my usual type but is much smarter al- an attribute thats very important to me due to being able to have long intelligent discussions .. but i lack passion with him. Ive never had those butterfly feelings . He likes to stay home and not see friends and i am prone to isolating myself and do not like this ‚Äî being with him makes me more apt to isolate myself. Been long distance about a year and our relationship has not had any breaks in a year ‚Äî not feeling smothered has made me feel more satisfied and less likely to want a break. He hasnt been able to move out due to having to build more of a portfolio of skills at his current job. He is now telling me hes ready to plan to move out here and i told him im worried about it because of our tumultuous past . In my head he is a handsome , tall , well educated motivated person who loves me definitely unconditionally and has put up with my indecisive bullshit . But deep down my hearts not in it and i feel like i will not be social with friends if we move in together and will feel resentment because i dont feel the passion on my end. I dont want to end it because i felt a similar way with my ex and voiced that we were basically just roommates and i got resentful and he ended up leaving my miserable ass . It was so painful and awful and i regret wanting more because i miss my ex and the things that bothered me dont bother me at all now (i think pain makes you a better prrson since you have to truly fave your fears and flaws.) anywho , because of what happened in the past im scared to lose him because im scared that if he moves on i will suddenly regret it and want everything back just like with my ex .

526,cahkvv,AmbitiousButLost,Rose Tinted Glasses Syndrome?,"Let me start by saying that I need help sorting out this mess in my head.  I [21M] am a serial monogamist.  I am in a committed relationship with my girlfriend [21F] of a year and a half (we live together, have a dog) and don't get me wrong in what I am about to say in the rest of this post: I am happy in this relationship and things are going well.  

To make sure I'm not breaking any rules, I am going to say that I am a college student in US

That said, I have these very strong feelings and thoughts for my ex girlfriend [21F] all the time.  I was with this girl for a year and I cheated on her with my current girlfriend while she was studying abroad.  (Huge dick move and I regret this deeply, feel free to roast me for this but it's not really what I came to talk about).  My ex was such a great person, super nice and caring and empathetic.  I honestly feel like maybe if anything she was TOO nice, like it was almost undesirable.  She also loved me very deeply, I believe.  Like she loved me in this way that I don't think I was even capable of reciprocating.  She was a pretty plain girl in general, never partied or drank or smoke (at least until we got together).  When she went away I got lonely and I clung onto someone who I thought was really amazing (my current girlfriend, for clarity I think she is still very amazing).  In retrospect, she is very much the antithesis of my ex girlfriend.  She is confident, headstrong, very social, sometimes quite emotional or angry, impatient, loves to party, ambitious, etc etc.  I have built a great relationship with her and I love her.

But the problem is I can't stop thinking about my ex.  I know that I felt like she was boring and too nice, but sometimes my girlfriend is far too mean.  I know my ex loved me so much and sometimes it feels like my current girlfriend doesn't love me that much at all.  I wanted to live with my ex very badly and I am living with my current girlfriend and it's wonderful.  I really don't think I can live alone or without that kind of love. 

To add to the incohesiveness of the above, I really think that I would probably have similar feelings about my current girlfriend if we broke up.   I would say ""Oh she was so angry but she really could get me out of my shell"". And ""Oh she was really a stoner but she got me to try all kinds of new, exciting, wonderful things"".

Why do I have these rose colored feelings and how do I put them away?  What is the right thing to do if you're me?  Am I a dick for feeling like this?",2019-07-08 06:40:25,1,1,relationship_advice
527,cahkjc,confusedlilbitty,"i looked at my boyfriends phone, please help me understand (f) both 20","I looked at my boyfriends text. i know this is not okay. i should never have done this as it is an invasion of privacy but my boyfriend and i have a very loving and trusting relationship so i have never felt the urge to do this before.

for background, i have had one relationship before this. the man i dated cheated on me with 16 girls, including his ex, and had multiple sex cam &amp; chat accounts that he paid for. i broke up with him about a year and a half ago, and spent a long time single trying to heal because i knew i would not be good in a relationship with the trust issues that had created. i grew a lot and didn‚Äôt plan on dating for a long time unless it was a very special connection that would benefit me for a long time and would most of all be very trusting. 

So i met G, my boyfriend 7 months ago. we started dating a month after we met. the first night we hung out i knew he was going to be something very special in my life. i knew i loved him after a few weeks. G means the world to me and is my best friend, i‚Äôve never clicked with anyone this much and we have a very special relationship. our families both love each other and we have been through hard things like an abortion and very close family members dying together and we always have each other‚Äôs backs. he also is the first guy to ever make me feel physically loved as i was raped at 15 and have never felt anything sexually since. he makes sex special and it‚Äôs because we have an extremely special connection. 

a few nights ago we were talking all night as we usually do and started talking about our past relationships. he and his ex broke up about 6 months before we met but they had been off and on for 2 years. i dated my ex for two years as well. he told me that i had honestly gotten his mind off of her but that now he realized how fake that relationship was and that he was hung up just because she was his first time blah blah. anyway we just confirmed that we see each other as the one and that our relationship is something very special. but that‚Äôs made me feel weird because i don‚Äôt think you can have a real relationship if you were still hung up on someone. idk, that might not be true for everyone. 

anyway, something told me to look at his phone tonight. in may for about 3 days we had a break where we didn‚Äôt talk because we were both very stressed about the abortion and had been arguing about stupid things. we eventually communicated and figured it all out and came together and have been great ever since but i saw that he tinder verification codes for the day we broke up and the day we talked. i also saw that his messages with his ex that he had from years ago (that he had shown me) were deleted and so that made me feel like they had talked since, especially because he had messages with his best friend telling him to post a video of him so his ex could see it and he wanted to look good for her. 

i have never had a reason to not trust this man and i understand we were on a break but in these few days i was heartbroken and i know it‚Äôs my fault for looking but all my insecurities and anxiety is flooding back from my past relationship. i don‚Äôt want a repeat. how should i go forward? should i just bow out of the relationship now to prevent getting hurt? i have no clue what to do",2019-07-08 06:39:20,5,1,relationship_advice
528,cahjed,Thundarered,Why do I stick around?,"M27F23 It's only been two months for God's sake. I dont even know where to start. I am going through a divorce after many years of unhappiness and she has recently ended a 5 year relationship of physical, verbal and definitely emotional abuse. I have seen the way he talks to her, the way he acts towards the children that they have. She says she working on seperating herself from him yet says she misses the good things. Which makes the whole situation more difficult.  

I have become emotionally attached to this women, why? It was great at first. We talked and hung out as often as we could. Now things are difficult, we mutually agreed that things were going too fast and we want to slow down. That's not the problem.  The problem is now she is hard to get ahold of, I always have to start the conversation, she doesnt go out of her way to even spend 10 minutes of time together before I need to leave out of town for work. She says she is too ""busy..."" I am willing to go so far out of my way to make her happy and yet I struggle to maintain simple communication. All I want to do is be there for her physically and emotionally. I make a point to ask her how her day was and listen to any problems she may be facing. If I said that I have had a bad day all I get is an ""I'm sorry"" no further question, no asking why. 

I should probably end it but I care very deeply for her. I want to be the man she has always wanted. Even after a little stress between us, a few hours later I will send her a text and ask her how her day is going and if there is anything she wants to get off her chest. Ugh I dont know what I should do. I want to wait it out, I want to see if she gets better so we can be happy together. Am I in the wrong for always starting the conversation with her?

529,cahiq0,mrmeeseeks8,My boyfriend and I can‚Äôt seem to decide on rules for living together and it‚Äôs making me want to move out,"For background, I live in a two bed, two bath apartment with my boyfriend, our dog, and a roommate. Ive become increasingly frustrated with some things and this has been building up for a while. I moved in about a month ago, and there have been a couple things I‚Äôve wanted to change. One, my boyfriend and his roommate would let dishes pile up and let the kitchen counter (there is only one) become filled with stuff. I organized the whole fucking kitchen and want at least my boyfriend to help with cleaning his dishes and putting them away every day, somewhere, and not just let them sit in the sink. He has piles of clothes in the bedroom and refuses to pick them up even though they are clean and I hate having piles of shit lying around. I have tried to address these cleanliness issues with him, and he thinks that the way he cleans is fine and that I just want things too clean. the worst is when I get frustrated about it, he gets this tone like he is trying to talk me down and says ‚Äúeverything is fine, it‚Äôs going to be ok‚Äù. Like, I know everything will be ‚Äúok‚Äù if you don‚Äôt clean up your clothes but Jesus fucking Christ just do it.

Another problem occurred this weekend. A ton of friends from college were coming out for the 4th and the weekend. Ok, great, I was excited to see them too. I returned home last Friday after work to a ton of people in the apartment and a party already having started with trash everywhere. I was not in the mood after work to come home to that and he didn‚Äôt understand why I wanted to just lay in bed and get away from all of it. Then two of the friends were invited by him to stay. Until TUESDAY. The living room and kitchen are one open space, and so I can‚Äôt even go into that room and just relax because there are two guys just living out there for five days. When I come home from work, they will just be there and I won‚Äôt be able to just play some video games and fucking relax I have to hang out. I tried to explain to him how I don‚Äôt like that, coming home and not feeling like I can‚Äôt fucking relax in my own apartment, and he said that me asking him not to invite people to spend the night here is the same as him doing it when it‚Äôs not what I want and it doesn‚Äôt happen often so when it does I just should deal with it.

It feels like time and time again my comfort and personal space are invaded by how he would rather have things (level of cleanliness and just inviting people to spend that much time here without my consent or caring how I feel about it) and even though I‚Äôm the one that cleans everything and makes sure everything stays nice I just have to fucking take it. I can‚Äôt live like that. How can I get him to listen and compromise?",2019-07-08 06:32:58,8,2,relationship_advice
530,cahibo,throw10001110101away,I [30f] broke up with my bf [31m],"We've been together for a few months but lately I just feel like he's taking me for granted. It's always me that has to drive (we live 2hrs apart), and I am always buying him cigarettes and stuff like that. I check my phone a lot and respond as soon as I see a message from him. We've been talking about things being long term and both are happy about that, or so I thought.

&amp;#x200B;

Then he starts just ignoring me and saying he needs to be left alone all the time. He says it's to process his feelings but it's actually just playing videogames. Even while I was at his house he just did his own thing online like he forgot I was even sitting there. I tried to talk to him about it but he ignores that too or just says that ""we're okay"" over and over. He only texts me a few times a day anymore and it's just short things like ""lol"" so I told him I can't do it anymore and he acted like I was blindsiding him and not being understanding of how much space he needs. 

&amp;#x200B;

If he needs that much space then I guess he will have it now, but I'm super sad about having to end it because I really like so much about him. He's so sweet when he wants to be and I love when he's present, but I just can't feel like a side dish anymore. He left me on read and stopped responding to me, I guess for the last time this time. Am I crazy or is it okay to demand respect even if it means it's over?",2019-07-08 06:31:34,6,2,relationship_advice

It's one thing to stop wanting to love and commit to someone but why do they feel the need to lose all respect as well? Is it so they can make themselves feel better about their decision? Is this a common thing for people to do?

I'm currently going through this with my ex who I have a child with. She suddenly checked out and started talking to someone else then broke up with me. Eventually she wanted to just be with him and that's when she decided to start being rude and disrespectful to me. Calling me names, talking down on my character, talking crap about our relationship, and comparing her new bf to me etc. We have a kid together so why would she not want to at least be civil and treat each other with respect.

That isn't a problem imo, but not everybody's type, of course. So a couple of months ago I met this amazing guy. He's 27, handsome, really smart. We connected instantly and flirted a lot (to be honest, he flirted more because he is better at this lol). We didn't get physically involved but got kind of close. Then I was gonna ask him out, and a mutual friend offered to feel the vibe with him first. So she asked if he was into me, and he said yes. Even said that I was ""super cool, awesome!"". However, he said that he wouldn't come after me since he was gonna start going to a therapist that week. 

It has been a month and I still don't know what to do, mostly because I've been (and still am, although less frequently) in therapy. It changed my life, and I'm sure it's gonna change his. But if I can help in any way, I want to.

535,cahfb1,adoptedcursedlife,"I'm hurting and need to tell my story but dont want to make ""family"" mad.","My brother 2 sisters and I were taken from our parents by the state when I was about seven. An aunt wanted my parents to give me to them and they said no. So she tried to get me to tell lies on them and when o wouldn't she got 1 of my sisters to. The state charged my dad with physical, mental, and sexual abuse of minors. After 2 yrs in court all they had was my sisters lie. People showed up after we were adopted and asked if they would let her testify and my adoptive my said no. That she lies all the time.
  However, after we were taken from bio parents, my brother was split from us. At the CPS (child protective services)  office they tormented me. Asking inappropriate  questions and beating on me and screaming at me making me say I hated people and wanted them dead. This was a part of what they called attatchment therapy and thankfully was only a thing from late 80s to early 90s. One of the foster parents I was placed with torture me every day I was there and I never seen the outside of the house. That woman would put me in the bottom of her closet with her knees in my shoulders and ball her fist with the middle finger sticking out and beat me in the sternum. Screaming and yelling at me telling me to scream and get it out of me and other weird things. This also was part of attatchment therapy. I didnt eve know all this had a name until I stumbled on it a few months ago. One time 1 of the 2 boys that were there, I guess they were hers, decided to tell her I had masturbated. I had no clue what that even was at the time. But she beat on me some more. I dont know if she even believed him or just was happy the government gave her a pass on child abuse. That night she hand cuffed me to the metal headboard. The next morning that same boy said that I got out of them and done it again before putting them back on. The other boy defended me and I showed her the red Mark's around my wrist to remind her how tight she had made them. She didnt care and off to the closet again. Some people came over and I remember 1 of them being her daughter and 2 men. She made me run the stairs and I was crying and wiping my nose on my shirt as she was yelling faster, faster. She got mad about the snot on the shirt and yanked it off of me. I kept falling on the stairs cuz the pants were so long so she just reached down and yanked those off knocking me backwards onto the stairs. I was wiping my nose on my arm and they all started taunting me saying I was eating the boogers and the daughter went to the kitchen and returned with jalapenos in between 2 slices of white bread. Her mom forced it down my throat with me on my knees in a headlock fighting for my life. I actually thought I was going to die. Not long after that I got sent to an institution and diagnosed withADHD.  The people who came to adopt me said I dont need meds just a butt whooping. And so that's what happened. As soon as the papers went through the courthouse I got whooped just about every day until I was about 15. The whoopings were way worse then anything I could have deserved most times. This ain't even all of it but it should give everyone a good idea of why I feel like I have to talk about it and share with someone in Hope's maybe someday something good will come of it. The woman that almost killed me can burn in hell. But there were some good times with the people that adopted me and my sisters.  I dont know what to do and I'm at a loss. I just wish i could make sense of it all. Should i come out with it all, and if so,..... how. Somebody plz help.",2019-07-08 06:21:15,9,2,relationship_advice

539,caheix,Shanny0007,"Fell in love with a girl, who now is in love with other guy, what should I do?","I am from India and before telling my story, I have something to say about India. You may know

about the stupid caste system and corruption problems in India but the worst is the education

system. Most of the Indian kids(espiecailly south India) study in a school where the school does

not have a ground to play and the school timings were horrible, school starts at 8am and ends at

6pm or 7:30pm. My entire schooling is done in Sri Chaitanya techno school(want to know about

this school?just google search ""chaitanya suicides""), it is famous for making the students study

like machines with no other extra curricalar activities. The boys and girls are not allowed to

talk to eachother.

It all started 2 and a half years ago. I am the kid that never goes to school but still manage

to get a decent score, I got the permission to leave the school hours before my fellow school

mates. So one day as usually I left the school, like I always do. Day after that day, I entered

the class, suddenly everybody(guys) went gaga over me, I was thinking what the hell happened to

these monkeys and they tried to explain what happened after I left but their anxiety struck

their explaination skills and took me alot of time to understand. One of the most beautiful girl

in the school came to the class called out my name(she pronounced it wrong tho). Well she called

me because she was ordered by a teacher. It wasn't a big deal, so I didn't care... but still it

was something for me. I never saw her in person before and the day I saw her it was her

birthday. I saw her going class to class with her friends giving sweets to the teacher and she

looked like a fallen angel and I wanted to talk to her, wish her but I couldn't do any of it

cause of the school's stupid rules. I saw her in the break in another dress but didn't talk to

her. I was a chubby guy and I had less courage when it comes to girls, because body shaming is

very common in the school. I never  dared to approach her in real life. So, I sent her a req in

insta, which she ignored and I tried everyday to reach her. Well, on the farewell day I wanted

to speak to her about my feelings after her performance but I couldn't do it because another guy

did it. I was 5 mins late and she accepted him. He is not a bad guy but he emotionally

blackmailed her into loving him. I was heart broken, felt dejected and never went to the school

again.I took home schooling for the next two years...I felt sad for sometime but I moved on. A

year after that I wanted to lose weight get fit, and I started working out and I was happy

seeing my results every month. One fine day, I opened my Insta to see the girl I had a crush on

accepted my follow req. It felt like flowers blooming to a whithered plant. Even after that she

didn't reply properly, so I replied to her status which says say something.. I wrote her with

all my heart, how I met her.. I was happy that she replied but she added a tag at the end and

that is ""bro"".(girls use this word to tell other people that they are not intrested in them). I

felt sad but I continued talking to her on insta, eventhough she is calling me bro. I took a

descision to ask her to stop calling me bro. I told her to stop calling me bro, also that I have

feelings for her. She said she has a boy friend. I told her that I am not proposing you, I am

only asking you to stop calling me bro. She agreed to that but knowing that she was still in a

relationship with that guy from 10th grade. I stopped talking to her for 15 days or so.. She put

a status saying ""YOU ONLY REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF SOMEONE WHEN THEY ARE GONE"" to which I

replied ""Yes"" and she said ""after all this time you replied.."". I talked to her like a friend

for 4-5 days but one day I did a big favor for her and I asked her number but she denied and

mention her boy friend in the convo, i got so angry I roasted her and her boy friend. She fell

in love with that guy when she was 14 just because he cried. I didn't want to talk to her but

man... few days later, I tried to be her friend again but she blocked me. There is a high chance

that the boy friend has acess to her insta. After a month, I created a fake acc to talk to her

but she immediately realized that it was me and blocked me again. She doesn't know that I have a

backup acc following her.

Whatever I do, I can't kill my love for her. I wanted her to be with me....

What should I do?

540,cahef1,throwaway876346,How do I (24F) get my boyfriend (24M) to start acting like an adult?,"Long time lurker, first time poster, throwaway because my boyfriend has reddit.  
I am not good with words and English isn't my first language, but I will try my best!

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend and I have been together for over 3 years, and lived together for 1,5 years. I love and adore him for the person he is, and I don't want to leave him. 

Before we moved together he was still living with his parents where he really didn't have to do any chores, and it absolutely shows. I have lived on my own for 4 years before we met.  
He will clean the kitchen once in a while and watering the plants indoors is his job and we take turns cleaning the litter boxes, but pretty much everything else he either only does if I ask him to, doesn't even notice it needs doing, or does such a bad job that I will just do it.

When I ask him to unload the dishwasher/ vacuum/ take out the trash/ unload the groceries he will do that (even though it takes him a few hours to get up sometimes... and often I end up doing the chore in the meantime because I get annoyed). At this point I don't ask him to clean the windows or load the washing machine anymore, because both end up a mess (windows streaky, washing machine too full to spin-dry). He also never swiped the floor because he doesn't know how, but when I try to show him he just says I'm better at it anyway.

Sometimes we argue about things like that, and those arguments always go one of two ways:

1) He will apologise and promise to do better. This will last for 2 weeks max. After that it's back to the old ways

2) When I tell him I'm his girlfriend, not his mom, he will tell me that he has supported me through some rough mental health patches (which he did! I suffered a burnout half a year ago, plus PTSD and BPD, and he helped me with all formal stuff needed for insurance and therapy and so on) and that I should support him with household chores

&amp;#x200B;

Same problem with chores applies to personal hygiene.

Last week we had an argument about toothbrushes. I told him he needed to order new ones since we need to swap them again, to which he replied that his toothbrush was perfectly okay and you only need to switch them when they start breaking (I took a photo and hope the link works:  [https://imgur.com/a/jinQc7n](https://imgur.com/a/jinQc7n) \- I could be mistaken but it honestly started to look like mold). I have to kiss the mouth that gets cleaned with that damn thing! I even tried texting his mom and asking for her help, and she did text him, but she just thought it was really funny.

I have to remind him every 2 to 3 days to shower. I absolutely refuse to give him head unless he showered on the same day, which shows some effect, but it's still not good.

At least he started washing his hands after he went to the toilet now - after a few fights of ""I DON'T CARE IF YOU DIDNT TOUCH YOUR THINGY, YOU STILL NEED TO WASH YOUR BLOODY HANDS!"" (srsly, what the fuck!)

&amp;#x200B;

How do I get him to do these things by his own? I want a partner, not a child.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl,dr: My boyfriend doesn't really do chores &amp; sometimes lacks personal hygiene. I am frustrated and don't know how to deal with it anymore",2019-07-08 06:18:22,14,2,relationship_advice
541,cahe15,settlerofcatan1,I [23M] am not sure if I should start long distance with this girl [23F],"Besides all the other struggles, this is another one now.

Long story short, previous semester I did an exchange abroad where at the end I met this beautiful, fantastic girl. Sadly we only met in the evening, at 'predrinking', fooled around a bit and next day she went back to her city (she doesn't live where I lived, approximately 6h bus ride away). For the reason of taking exam she was bak in around 10 days. During those 10 days we stayed in touch, texted a lot and when she was back we spent 3 or 4 really awesome day together (we were acting like a couple, even though we weren't). 

After returning to her city, I decided to pay her a visit before leaving in her city, where we had a good time again.

Anyway, now I'm away, we wouldn't be able to see each other for at least 3 months (before I'd not be able to visit her). We have been talking, but she isn't happy with how distant I act (I have some relationship concerns and trust issues). Finally yesterday I told her I'm not able to do this, long distance. I had one before, it wasn't the best, also, we have barely met each other (4 - 5 days in total). 

She told me that she somhow expected it, that she's disappointed, cause she thought I'm the one. It breaks me to see her like that, I really care about her.

She was nothing but supporting and loving, she helped me with my issues and was always there for me (even though just from distance). She's really beautiful too.

I don't know, did I make a huge mistake? I am not sure how to proceed. It feels like a battle between heart and brain. I am so affraid of commitment and seriousness that LDR requires, what if I can't? If I change my mind? I can't disappoint her (again).

This post must be a serious mess, it reflects my feeling right now.

I want to start off by saying that I realize what I am going to talk about may be selfish or unfair and I am trying to change this but I‚Äôm not sure what to do, so I‚Äôm here for some help.

I‚Äôve (19F) been dating this guy (21M) for about 4 months. We have an amazingly matched synergy, is easy to spend time with, and is just everything I would want in a partner. However, I feel that an insecurity of mine may be affecting my trust in him. He‚Äôs a lot more experienced sexually than I am and has had many more partners than I (no shame in that!) and had been in a 3 year relationship with a gorgeous, talented blonde about a year ago. My insecurities, I feel, have stemmed from him sharing his past sexual experiences with me. This should be a normal thing, but he is pretty hardcore and I was just starting to get into anything mildly kinky. In particular, his sexual relationship with his ex has really bothered me. I wish I didn‚Äôt know as much as I do. It makes me feel like I will always be inadequate to her. Despite the fact that she treated him poorly and was a shitty partner to him, he still doesn‚Äôt speak badly of her and brings her up every so often. I have told him this upsets me greatly and he‚Äôs responded in two ways: ‚ÄúI was just making conversation‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to erase three years‚Äù. All of this is absolutely eating away at me. I may also add that I am bipolar and struggle greatly with extreme paranoia and anxiety, so the fear of him cheating on me, irrational as it may be, is still there. I don‚Äôt want to bring this up to him because I already feel bad enough about having an unstable mood that projecting my paranoia on him wouldn‚Äôt feel fair. I‚Äôm sorry if this is insensitive or selfish- I truly just want to better the issue.

546,cahczc,heartbrokenmess-,What to do from here??,"Hey guys. 
My 25M husband has been cheating on me 25F. 

We‚Äôve been having a few ‚Äòissues‚Äô for a couple of weeks now. Communication issues and trust issues. Before I get to far ahead of myself, I feel I need to give a bit of a backstory. 

We were high school sweethearts. We were on and off for years because of him. He would dump me and then come back. Of course being in madly in love, I took him back every time. We finally broke up for a year and moved on. We later found ourselves back together. 
He swore he was ready to settle down and he swore he was over the games. I took him back. We ended up pregnant a month or so later. We were ecstatic. After a year of being together, we got engaged. He worked so hard so he could provide for us while I went to school to get my degree. Now, things were rough. My mother was coming over almost every day (she was also our babysitter but she kept our child at her house). Anyways, I caught him texting a girl talking about how her butt used to look nice but that‚Äôs it. And she wasn‚Äôt really into it. He begged me to stay. Coming from a broken home, I didn‚Äôt want my child to grow up like that. He convinced me that it was a mistake because he was mad, it was late, and because he was drunk. I also caught him snap chatting girls. I have no clue what was said or who it was. Again, I was convinced he loved me and was sorry. 

After I graduated school, we moved back to our home town. We got married once we got on our feet. I‚Äôll never forget when he first seen me walking down the isle. He couldn‚Äôt look at us because he was trying not to cry. 

Fast forward 11 months. We‚Äôve been settled like an old married couple of 6 years now but only married for almost a year( it matters). 

We‚Äôve been in a routine for a while now. While I still don‚Äôt trust him completely, he promised on everything he wouldn‚Äôt do anything like that to hurt me, especially after we got married because our marriage meant everything to him. 

A couple of weeks ago, we were arguing. He was going out more, playing hobbies and such while I go to work and then come home and be a mom. I‚Äôm not perfect. I can‚Äôt communicate good with my issues. He also expects me to forget the past because ‚Äúit was a long time ago and I haven‚Äôt found anything since we‚Äôve been married‚Äù. After the little bit of arguing (nothing major but an argument that has spanned out for a few days). I thought we worked past it and was good. We were back to our old ways of being glued together and happy‚Äîor so I thought. Everything was fine on Monday, then Monday night on my way home from work, he gets snappy about how he‚Äôs been thinking and I don‚Äôt give him the trust he deserves and how I don‚Äôt communicate with him and tell him in depth how I feel and why or listen to him. I feel I do. And how I keep him sheltered because I get mad when he does something and I won‚Äôt talk to him until I‚Äôm over it and how it‚Äôs always what I want. He kept going on and on. He said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôm just done. We live like room mates instead of a married couple‚Äù. Our sex life was great. We would do it regularly like 4 times a week on average.

On Tuesday, he ghosts me the whole day until that evening just to tell me he‚Äôs going to have a few with his buddy. Tuesday night, he comes home late and washes his face, brushed his teeth and got into bed. He only said a few sentences to me. Next morning, he got up and got ready for work and left. Didn‚Äôt shower. Didn‚Äôt hear from him all day which is not normal. I give him space. He calls me when he gets off work saying he‚Äôs going to work on a derby car and I told him I‚Äôd see him that night. We got off the phone. I messaged him and talked to him. We said a few things and he was just being so short. I told him I‚Äôd go to the courthouse to start the paper work. He just said ok. I said isn‚Äôt that what you want? No reply. That night I ask if he‚Äôs coming home and he said he was still working on the car but he probably would in a few to shower and clean up. Then nothing. He didn‚Äôt come home. He was gone for two days barely texting me at all. He‚Äôs not even asked about our child which he‚Äôs usually super crazy about. He told me he didn‚Äôt know what he wanted but he wouldn‚Äôt say the D word. Then he just started ignoring me. When he finally did come home. He wouldn‚Äôt even really look at me let alone talk to me. He just kept telling me he didn‚Äôt know what he wanted but he would talk to me when he was ready. That night, I went into the closet and noticed his dirty clothes was in the floor (mind you, he left after he showered and grabbed a few things.) so I went to move his clothes and noticed he had a bunch of cum stains on his underwear. Now, I‚Äôm not saying he wasn‚Äôt working on a car. But I know cum stains when I see them. And it wasn‚Äôt just one or two. It‚Äôs like 7 or 8 spots ranging from the size of a dime- a quarter. The spots were also only in the crotch area. He hasn‚Äôt messaged me or anything since he left. 

I haven‚Äôt confronted him yet. I‚Äôm scared, sick, nervous, and numb. I know he will deny but I feel stuck in a weird position. I don‚Äôt want to lose my family. We‚Äôve been through way to much and fought to hard to be together. But I also can‚Äôt let him think it‚Äôs ok to go do what he wants and I‚Äôll still be there. 

I guess I‚Äôm looking for advice and just someone to talk to. I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to go about doing. 

I don‚Äôt understand why he cheated. 

People who cheated, 
Did you feel guilt? 
Could you look your S/O in the eye?
Why did you do it? 


If you have read all of this, I sincerely thank you as I know it is very long. I‚Äôm just lost on what to do or how to feel. 

I should also note, I have a appointment with a therapist this week. I plan to speak to them about this as well. I asked him to go. He told me no. When I asked why he was ghosting me and being a dick, he asked me how it felt to be on the other side of the fence. ‚ÄúIt sucks being treated like that doesn‚Äôt it‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm so lost while trying to be strong for our child.

Edit**** forgot to say, this is a throw away account because I can‚Äôt risk him finding this.",2019-07-08 06:13:35,11,1,relationship_advice
547,cahcz4,lovelyplatypus,I‚Äôm interested and can‚Äôt tell if he is... We‚Äôve had a discussion but still unclear.,"TL;DR at the end

So theres a guy [M 24] I [F 22]have known a couple years and have recently gotten really close with. We went on a group trip together with friends &amp; basically only spent time with each other. After getting home from the trip we spent time together every single day. I developed some feelings after the trip (there were a couple of flirty encounters). We kept doing very couple-esque things from day to day kind of things all the way to date like things. Eventually he had to leave and move away for work, so I told him how I felt because why not. He said he didn‚Äôt reciprocate the feelings. It was fine because I would rather continue as we were before than date him. So we did, even the romantic vibey hang outs. It came time for him to leave and we talked about it again and it ended with him throwing a myriad of compliments at me. I was very confused. I had a couple friends think that he was more worried about starting something and not being able to finish because of work. Long distance is not our thing, he had brought that up during one of our talks. A few other friends think he is just flirty by nature and is not actually into me. But what I do know, is that if he did have feelings back he would not open up and talk to me about this because he would be scared of getting hurt. So what is Reddit‚Äôs opinion on this situation? I feel like I‚Äôm living in a sad romcom. Maybe I‚Äôm just reading into this situation too hard.

TL;DR
I like a friend and he may or may not like me back due to his circumstances, what he has said in conversations after telling him my feelings, and our time spent together. I need help deciding.",2019-07-08 06:13:33,1,1,relationship_advice
548,cahcxn,Actual-Giraffe,I'm very distraught about a message I saw,"The other day my girlfriend and I were hanging out together in my apartment, just laying around and watching TV. At one point she took out her phone and was looking through her snapchat, and as I usually do, I lied next to her and half watched the stories and videos/pictures she was looking at. This is pretty normal, and she's never hidden her phone or gotten annoyed about me watching, nor did she do that this time. However, she came to a video message from an acquaintance of hers, a guy, that also had a video. The video itself was unremarkable, I mostly wasnt paying attention, but when it ended I saw the message he had sent her prior to the video, which read ""Sorry I'm asexual, but you can always try xP"". She ignored the message and started telling me something about the guy, which had nothing to do about the video or message. This message has been on my mind ever since, and I'd really like some advice/anybody's thoughts on it.



Before you comment, yes obviously I'm going to confront her about it, but as I'm writing this she's already asleep, and tomorrow she'll be taking the whole day to herself as a detox day since she's had a pretty stressful month, so at the least I'll have to wait until Tuesday.",2019-07-08 06:13:25,2,1,relationship_advice

Somehow, while we were in college, she realized her feelings for me and we came into relationship after that. It went strong for 3 years, post which she started having anxiety issues. I was still there for her and was supporting her in every way I could. Few months later, I went into depression due to problems I had with my parents and college. It was so bad that I started pushing people away from me, including her. She still had anxieties, but due to my own problems I started getting irritated. Eventually I broke up with her. She requested 2-3 times post breakup that we should give it another try, but I was too afraid and would cry a lot, and yet say no to her over text everytime. We were still talking though but on my last bday she called me up to say this would be the last call ever and she has moved on  and eventually blocked me from everywhere.

This hit me hard. I was getting better with my depression, due to treatments from the doctor, but post this, it got worse. Even though the breakup was my decision and it has been over an year since we broke up, I am not able to move on. I still miss her. Is there anythings I can do to get back with her. I am thinking of doing some grand gesture but if she has moved on then I am afraid this would only hurt her. Things are so bad that she won't even pick up my call, nor would she answer my text and has asked all of our common friends to ask me to stay away from her.

I've never had more than a peck on the lips.  I don't know how to say this to the guy I've been talking to, or if I even should say anything at all.  The thing is that I've known this guy since high school, and we've always been very flirty, there's always been a lot of sexual tension.  While our relationship with each other has never been physical it's always been sexual, if that makes sense.  We used to sext a lot, exchange nudes, but we never really hung out in person (we never ran in the same circles in high school so to be honest my friends didn't even know that we knew each other).  The joke was always that we were catfishing each other.  Anyway, we've started talking to each other again recently and he's been asking to take me on a date.  I know that if he were to go in for even just a hug I would flinch and probably seem very uncomfortable.  I would be uncomfortable truthfully.  So I feel like maybe I should bring this up to him beforehand, but I really don't know how to do so.  I like this guy and I don't want him to think otherwise because of my awkwardness.

554,cah98n,rxkr_,My [22M] relationship with my girlfriend [22F] is stale and dull beyond repair it seems,"We've been together for about 2 years now and it just seems so stale... 

&amp;#x200B;

When we first got together, we used to be full of fire. I mean, active sex life, go out on dates, cuddling and the usual stuff. Then it starts to die down, we dont even touch each other that much anymore. And I don't mean sexually, just cuddle, and hugs. Nothing. It even seems like she dont seem to like it at times.. When I raised this up with her a while ago, it broke into an argument with her saying ""so basically we need to be closer?"" which is such a shallow point to be making after me telling her what's the problem. It's not even solving the roots of the problem. But problem is, she dont see that she's changed or that this is a problem at all. There's literally no way to solve this if I'm the only one seeing this as a problem. It's the school holidays now and she's been going out with her friends and yet she doesn't want to take the time to go out on a date. 

&amp;#x200B;

I usually go over on Fridays to stay over till Sunday evening. And normally in the past we'll watch videos, Netflix together, which is cool like I actually enjoy that. But now, she jsut does her own thing. After dinner, she'll just read her kindle, watch her own videos and when I ask if  I can join i'm met with a ""why?"".  Her justification is that nowadays she likes to watch her own kpop stuff at her own pace, sometimes she'll fast forward videos to skip parts she don't wanna watch. When we sleep, she used to cuddle but now she's just back facing me watching her vids or reading. I just asked if she wanted to go cafe over the weekends grab a cup of coffee and just chill but she just said she's going out on sat and sunday she wants to stay home. Heck, I don't even want sex(even though the last time we did anything was a good 6 months ago) I just want us to interact and be more of a couple than just a good old friend.

&amp;#x200B;

And in the recent months or actually past year, she gets irritated with me very easily...Like if I said something that just didn't make any sense to her she'll just use this tone, i'm not sure what to even call this tone. Condescending? To challenge what I said. And I really hate it. But I raised it up and it improved slightly. I just am lost at what to do. Why am I even going over or even staying together at this rate? 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to leave her though, I want this to work out but I just can't seem to get through to her. She has an impression that all I ever want is to get back to how we were during honeymoon phase sigh.

557,cah83e,ConfusedSkyscraper,[19M] My sister [15F] is dating one of my best friends [17M] and acting really controlling. How can I help diffuse this without hurting one of them?,"Throwaway because my sister knows about my real account.

First, let me preface this by saying that I'm not necessarily against the relationship. I'd rather my sister date a friend who I know will treat her right than some rando from school who'll try who knows what. But I'd also rather my friend date someone who'll give him the freedom to hang out with the boys. 

Context:

S - Sister [15F]; Her friend group consists of five other girls between 14 and 16.

F - Friend [17M]; Our friend group consists of five guys and five girls, all between 17 and 19 currently.

Our two friend groups are pretty close to each other, since most of my sisters friends have an older sibling in my group.

S and F started dating in November of last year. I was off at university, so I didn't see the bulk of the relationship, but from what I can gather, pretty much everyone who knew about it was against it (including any parents that knew). When I came home in May, S was acting really controlling. She was in a call with F for pretty much every free minute of her day, and when we would get together, it would be impossible to pry her away from F, even if the groups wanted to do their own things. When I finally got alone with F (only because S fell asleep), he described her as ""clingy"" and ""overexcited"". 

Thing is, S has depression and suicidal tendencies, and she likes F because of how he listens and offers emotional support (I can confirm, he's pretty good at that). She's been blocking out anyone who confronts her about F, which has been damaging to her other friendships. F doesn't want to say anything for fear of pulling the wrong Jenga block, but everyone knows that something needs to happen. I think the closest analogy is a drug addiction, where S is ""addicted"" to F. She shouldn't keep feeding that dependence, but it's also not right to just quit cold turkey. 

To make matters worse, F turns 18 in September, so he'll no longer be a minor.

He took it badly, especially when I began a new, healthier, in-person relationship with someone closer to my age (17M).

563,cah5nm,EmberKasai,My (23F) family keeps borrowing money that it's eating away at my savings and I have to cancel plans with friends.,"I come from a poor family, am still poor actually. Around 3 years ago though, we apparently got this sort of inheritance from properties my parents used to be fighting over with my aunts and uncles. We all got a fairly large amount (except my mom because there were some problems), and we all spent it in our own ways. I haven't touched mine except for that one trip abroad I did.

&amp;#x200B;

The past few years though, my family is still struggling financially despite it. Recently, my brother (30?M) Q has been borrowing money to pay off some credit card debt I think and some day-to-day expenses I guess? Problem is that he can't turn to anyone else since my mom has literally nothing, my sister A (30+) spent hers on I don't even know what (she buys a lot of shit online), and my other brother B (30+) bought a condo. Q got married. Basically, I'm the only one he can borrow from now. 

&amp;#x200B;

The past years, I was sorta fine letting him borrow since I'm not using it anyway, but it's accumulated to the point that it's somewhere around $20,000 (converted in dollars for convenience). Q got hit with a lot of bad luck lately because they have to help pay for cancer treatment to his wife's siblings and their car recently broke down. He's moving jobs to get better pay, but he won't get paid in a while and is asking to borrow again for household expenses. I haven't told him if I would let him borrow yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from that, my mom also kinda borrows a lot of money from me, too. I don't mind exactly since I still live with her and stuff, so it should count as rent. The thing is that she borrows more than what we pay for rent since she sends money to her siblings somewhere far and also has to pay for the lawyer (related to the inheritance thing and why she hasn't gotten her share). She borrows roughly $500 every other month, which is more than what I make in a month. I half expected her to at least pay back the ones she sends to her siblings, but it looks like she doesn't plan to because it looks like she forgot all about them.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so stressed out now because I'm tapping away at my savings now, and I'm guilted by my mom to lend Q money cus that's what family does and it's easier to borrow from a sibling and shit. But like it makes me constantly depressed and anxious, and it's frustrating that I've canceled vacations and stuff just because the thought of taking out money makes me depressed. This month, I was planning on going a weekend resort thing that me and my college friends have been planning for months, but now I'm half considering backing out because I won't have any money for it if I let Q borrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so tired of being poor by association, and my family is just so unreliable. I can't even get a break, like I haven't seen any of my friends in two years, and I haven't left the house for anything aside from gym and groceries because I have to keep working to get more money to replenish my bank account.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I just need advice on how to handle my family (and I guess my friends too since I'm gonna be flaking out *again* to another group meet up). Sorry for the long post...",2019-07-08 05:48:28,14,3,relationship_advice
564,cah5hu,Jakob340,I‚Äôm (19M) and I want to work out a long distance relationship with a guy (18M).,I was in New York recently and was on a dating app and found a guy in New Jersey I really liked. I gave him my snapchat and we‚Äôve talked for a couple weeks and we‚Äôre both really into each other and he even says I‚Äôm ‚Äúperfect‚Äù. I told him I wanted to make our relationship serious but he lives in New Jersey and I live in Texas. He thinks he won‚Äôt be able to be a good boyfriend to me because he‚Äôs far away and works a lot so he won‚Äôt be able to talk to me all too much and he doesn‚Äôt want to lead me on but not be able to give me what I want. I heavily insisted that I‚Äôm fine with however much we can see each other (realistically a couple times a year at most) and talk to each other. He still doesn‚Äôt want to commit. He went to sleep and asked me the next day if we could still be friends. The thing is I caught feelings for him so strong and I love him so much but I feel like remaining friends would only be a constant reminder of a happy relationship that could‚Äôve been. I told him we ‚Äúcould still be friends I guess‚Äù and he didn‚Äôt like that reply and he feels like it‚Äôs a bad mentality to only ‚Äúwant to date someone or not talk to them anymore‚Äù which I agree. But talking to him and still being madly in love with him can‚Äôt possibly be healthy for my mental state. How do I handle this situation?,2019-07-08 05:47:56,3,2,relationship_advice
565,cah56n,1221burner,Wife is still close with half brother who used to sexually abuse her and professed his feelings for her,"So this story is a little complicated but I'll try my best. A few years ago my wife and I were having some major issues and during this fight she mentioned that her half brother is in love with her. Not as in a brotherly love but she told me he said if people didnt view it as weird he would pursue a relationship with her. Now mind you this was quite a few years ago. She told me once they had a sexual encounter when she was in middle school (she was abused by her other older brother but that was legally dealt with years ago). Her other brother reminded my wife of this event but my wife stay adamant that she doesn't really remember the encounter at all. Since this all came to light between us she has maintained fairly consistent contact with the brother that told her he was in love with her. Now let me say now that I've never once had a reason not to trust my wife (that I know of). I have gone through her conversations specifically with him via their texts (we both have open access to each others phones neither of us would consider this a breach of privacy dont worry) and while I have seen him make obviously suggestive comments (most recently about how he never gets to see her in yoga pants.... yeah I know lol but shit of that nature) to her over time but I have never seen her participate in throwing anything suggestive back at him so I have no reason to really be worried right?

Well over the years I have brought up how much this and him bothers me and its caused much tension in my marriage. She has been willing to cut him out of her life for me but I can tell it's not what she wants. I do genuinely think she wants just a brother and sister relationship but I know he wants more and IF she gave him the time of day he would jump on it immediately regardless of me or our marriage. I should add she is going to therapy for her past issues which I know includes her and him. 

My issue is they are going to the beach with just the 2 of them and our 2 oldest daughters for like 2-3 nights. I was initially very upset when she first told me which in turn made her very mad because she wants to go really bad. But I cannot shake the immense feeling of anger. I do not like the thought of him having her alone for nights on end. I dont think he would every aggressively pursue her but I could see him trying to seduce her some how (likely through what he would consider his own charm). 

Am I in the wrong to feel this way? I noticed tonight she deleted a bunch of texts including all of his. She kept only a few random conversations and that has me thinking he said something she knew would make me mad. Again I want to make it  clear shes never given me a reason not to trust her. But I also cant get rid of my feelings. Is this just something I should discuss with my own therapist and move on? Or is there some justification in my feelings and maybe it would be healthier to bring it up with her?

Edit: I see a lot of people saying I should be worried about my kids. He has a child of his own and as crazy as it sounds i know he would never try anything. He knows as well as I do if anything came back to me (it would) I'd kill him. My concern is more with how I should confront her about how I feel rather than being worries something is actually happening. You need to understand shes stayed pretty consistent with how shes treated him and has made it clear to him what type of relationship she wants. I think shea being looked at as more of a devious type when in all reality shes just extremely naive",2019-07-08 05:46:58,38,90,relationship_advice
566,cah4xb,willkillpancakes,How do I end a friendship?,"Hi. I am 15(F) and I need some advice. Fyi, I am on mobile and I suck at writing. At the beginning of freshman year (last year), I was in this science class with this girl (we'll call her Lucy). Lucy and I were both introverts and she was the only one I would really talk to. She was always negative to me which made me more negative. We would always walk to the next class together since our classes were close. Lucy always talked about her home life. She would talk about her sisters and her dogs ignoring her. All I could do is to say I was sorry or shrug. I couldn't really help her. I was invited to her birthday party and I could tell that her family supports and loves her. Then, next semester rolls around. Another introvert (Amanda) moved into our school district. She was much more friendly, positive, and more relatable. She was someone I could talk to. I started hanging out with Amanda more often and the only time Lucy and I would talk, was passing period. I started to realise how much Lucy was affecting me. It would always be about her. Everytime I would try to talk to her about something else, it would always come back to her problems. Everytime Amanda and I would talk, she would always stare at us. While the teacher taught, she would draw or stare at me. I tried to drift apart by not talking to her (I know that it's not right now that I look back.). If I didnt talk back to her, she would mutter something under her breath. I really didn't want to hurt her. When the school year was almost done she asked me if I was bothering her. I suck at confrontation so I said no. Yesterday she said hi to me via text from another friend. I really dont want to talk to her anymore. Shes really negative and I'm so tired of being negative myself. I really dont want to be in any of her classes this year because of this. How can I go about doing this without being an ass or hurting her?",2019-07-08 05:46:11,6,1,relationship_advice

568,cah4lm,Magicaldave918,I [22M] want to start over with my partner [23F],"Boy do I feel pretty sad for having to post this on Reddit. But I‚Äôve seen worse stuff on here and think you guys could offer some genuine input. 

I‚Äôve known my partner for about ten years now. We‚Äôve been through a lot - including getting arrested for the first time together as kids because we found out about curfew laws the hard way. 

We‚Äôve been together on and off for about three years. We‚Äôve had some conflicts, as she has severe emotional issues and I have my own and just repressed the hell out of them growing up. 

About two years ago we had a kid and that was really hard on us. I was super resistant at first and it destroyed our sex life even up to now. But, I‚Äôve since learned I love being a dad more than anything in the world. 

Fast forward a bit, six months ago I quit my job. I just couldn‚Äôt go back to it any more. Finding a new job was easy and I got a lot of offers, but the stress of it all caused a literally violent breakup. She got all the important shit and I have a nice collection of clothes and computers. 

It took a while but we started back up, and probably went back into things too fast. Like from not talking at all to all three of us sharing a bed again within the space of about a week once we got started. 

Here‚Äôs where things get hairy. About a month in, she didn‚Äôt come home and told me she stayed with someone from work. I know now this is a lie, and not because she shared that with me. 

She kept saying we were gonna go out and do such and such on the weekends but ended up back at the same place every night. At some point it dawned on me that she didn‚Äôt have any sexual interest in me any more and that was when I really knew something was wrong. 

Quite a while after I‚Äôd worked it out already, she said she was breaking up with me, again. Another week or two later she admitted she‚Äôd been sleeping with someone but it wasn‚Äôt anything serious. At this point we don‚Äôt talk too much, but at least a bit daily so I can FaceTime my kid or something like that. I know when she‚Äôs at ‚Äúhis‚Äù house I‚Äôm not getting even the slightest acknowledgment most times so I don‚Äôt bother. I do at least get to see her on weekends and occasionally I‚Äôve talked her into hanging out and playing video games with me or something. 

And here‚Äôs where I am. I work my ass off to support the person I love, most nights during the week I sleep on a recliner in a storage unit and she‚Äôs warm and cozy in another man‚Äôs bed. I try hard to be caring and supportive on the occasion she does talk to me, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôm just burying myself deeper by participating at this point. 

Tell me what you think, Reddit. How should I go forward? How can I not be overwhelmed with negative emotion and lash out over it in this situation? Most importantly. How can I rebuild my family? Am I just trying to move too fast here? 

 Sorry for the long post, and thanks for just reading it. Along with any responses you guys can offer.",2019-07-08 05:44:57,15,0,relationship_advice
569,cah43u,quierovolar,"My [26M] girlfriend‚Äôs [24F] mom passed away 6 years ago, she copes by abusing alcohol and it‚Äôs tearing us apart.","We‚Äôve been dating for almost 4 years now (met Junior year of college), so when we met her mom had passed away about 2 years prior. It hit her extremely hard because after her mom passed, her crack addict father was given custody of her 3 younger sisters. The 3 girls experienced physical and emotional abuse up until they turned 18. My girlfriend is still dealing with all of this trauma and she copes in really unhealthy ways. She abuses alcohol, sometimes she will drink 2-3 bottles of wine in one night. After she‚Äôs really drunk she starts lashing out and treating me like shit. She stopped showing up to school during our last semester, so even though she walked, she didn‚Äôt actually graduate. She can‚Äôt hold any job for longer than a few months. She doesn‚Äôt even formally quit, she just stops showing up. When she does this it put me in a bad position financially because now I am forced to cover her portion of the bills. I try really hard to be there and be a great support but I am tired of this. I feel like I am being used as a punching bag. It feels like I have to always hold it together no matter what I‚Äôm going through because she is liable to break down at any point. She is not stable in any way. Her finances are a disaster, she has let her debts go to collections, she‚Äôs late on paying literally everything, and can‚Äôt be trusted to do simple tasks. I work all day and get home to a dirty house, the dogs don‚Äôt get fed, she just sleeps and drinks the day away. It‚Äôs not fair because I‚Äôve lost 3 important people in my life this past year and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm not allowed to grieve because she feels her loss was worse. I lost a step parent, my grandmother, and a close friend all in one year and I haven‚Äôt been able to properly deal with it because I am the main provider in our relationship. If I don‚Äôt hold it together everything will fall apart because of how unreliable she is. I love my girlfriend very much and I want a future with her. How do I tell her in the most loving way they she has to move on with her life and she has to find a better way to cope?! I don‚Äôt want to sound dismissive or sound insensitive, but it‚Äôs wearing me down so much. I‚Äôm going insane :(

Any advice is appreciated, thank you for reading my post and sorry if it‚Äôs worded badly I‚Äôm really emotional right now.",2019-07-08 05:43:08,8,2,relationship_advice
570,cah38t,subliminalmessage9,GF 22 thinks it is OK for her to hang out with a friend that had a crush on her for 3 years,"I have been lurking on this sub for a while now and haven't posted anything yet up until now. English is not my first language and this is our first relationship ever. Some things might seem unimportant but they are needed background for this story. It's quite long.

To start from the beginning. We both got into college, which takes about 4 years over here. She made a good friend in the first year. We were in different classes and i didn't notice her often. This friend became someone she was pretty close to back then until he started acting weird. He started making public confessions and pushing love letters through her mailbox. She rejected him everytime. 

Fastforward to the beginning of the third year. Me and her started talking and we really hit it off. The friend kept making her uncomfortable and one day he just held her hand while talking at the table. She told him not to do that. We got into a relationship shortly after. Now some other issues come into play. Back then she felt like she couldn't talk to me about certain problems and that the guy was the only one she could talk to.

Now, i have told her this made me extremely uncomfortable and either way we will have to learn how to talk to each other when being in a relationship. She thinks that it is OK because he told her he will just be friends with her.

I went on exchange for 5 months, and had a long distance relationship with her for 2 of that. It just became too much. We were fighting too much. As soon as it ended, i became depressed as hell. After 2 weeks i realized that i paid a shitload of money for the exchange and wanted to enjoy something i will only go through once. Which meant partying drinking and sex. When i came back, she wanted to know everything i did there. I told her via text that we will talk about it in 2 days in real life. I wanted to be completely honest. She kept annoying and eventually ignoring me and just being rude, so i got mad and told her all the details via text (my bad). 

We got back together after 2 weeks and good talks about this. Now the problem is, we are now in the end of our fourth year and we are graduating. She is still talking to this guy and went on to going to his house to hang out with him alone 2 months ago. I again expressed my concern. Lately after a fight that is unrelated to this, she started ignoring me while she is online and when i ask her who she's talking to the guys name pops up. She has always said she will never like the guy and he's just a good friend but i just can't believe that. So we got into a fight last night.

She basically believes that her being friends with him and hanging out and talking so much is normal and if i would hang out with someone that had a crush on me, that wouldn't be normal. I gave her an example of a girl that tried to kiss me in the third year while going out and i avoided her. She asked a month ago if we could have drinks and i told my gf and she said that she's just in it for sex and her guy friend not. I told her that after three years of pursuing you, you think he never ever oncd thought about having sex? She continued to bring up the girls i had on exchange and i mentioned that we broke up at the time. It went on with throwing more shit arguments at eachother. 

I told her that it's about the principle that it's not ok to do something to me that you wouldn't be ok with me doing to you. She believes that it's different and she's allowed to hang out anf talk till 3am with that guy and i'm not allowed to get drinks or food with that girl.

What do you guys think. I honestly believe that i'm an asshole for some reason and that i'm doing something wrong..",2019-07-08 05:40:17,11,1,relationship_advice

After a few weeks of dating again I had found out that during the one year gap, she had slept with at least 5 other guys within a one-month span. Maybe I‚Äôm being selfish but I was hurt when I found the news out because she said she only did it because she needed affection and that I wasn‚Äôt there to give it to her.

573,cah03o,throwawayhehe13,"My dad wants to be closer, but i have trouble letting him in","I (19M) have a weird relationship with my dad (65). He has never been good with kids therefore he isn't in a lot of my memories as a child. Only when i began to hit puberty did he start to talk to me. I never really let him in, and I'm not sure the exact reason why. I don't like to talk about my person problems with him, my feeling or any thing really. This is for two reasons mainly that i can think of. One is that he isn't a good listener, he always feels the need to give me advice which can be nice but can also feel belittling. The second reason is that he doesn't understand me and treats me like my older brother (24) who is very different. I don't like how he acts when he knows things about me, as if he has some leverage over my mother. He will also brag or just overshare about things i told him in confidence. It can be very frustrating.

With my dad getting older i feel like i need to give him a chance and include him in my life more, because i can tell that's what he wants. But i just don't like to share that kind of stuff with him and don't feel like he need to be in my business. He still treats me like a child, granted I am young but I'm old enough to make my own choices in life. 

I expect that you all might ask if i have talked to him and just explained how i feel. But it's not really that simple. I have tried to talk to him about not sharing my life or not giving me advice i didn't ask for but he ends up getting angry with me. He isn't the most self aware person and when i tell him how he acts he doesn't understand and becomes defensive. I just end up feeling bad no matter if i do share or don't share.

I don't believe we would ever split BUT... sh$% happens, right?  Anyhow, here is my question.... 

What stipulations should I add to said legal document to protect myself?  In case, God forbid, this ever were to happen.  I don't want to put myself at risk of getting kicked out of my home because it is not ""my house.""  I was thinking of putting in that I had one year grace period to move out, he would vacate the house while I had my one year grace period.  I'm not sure how that would all work out but I wouldn't be homeless with no where to turn.  I would have time to get my affairs in order.  He'd still get the house, eventually.

The first signs i remember thinking back is when my dad moved into the guest room and this was probably when I was about five and wrote it off most of my life until highschool when I realized that wasn‚Äôt normal. As I have gotten older and older I have been able to notice how broken it is. They don‚Äôt really argue or yell but they just dont interact unless absolutely necessary. They both seem upset  and unhappy with how things are but try to hide it and the older I get the more i realize this. Anyways seeing their unhappiness has made me very scared to get into a relationship and also i am just clueless as to how a healthy and happy relationship works. I have never once seen my parents kiss or hug. They never really talk to each other so I feel that if i did ever find a gf i would be clueless as to what to do or how to talk or behave with them.

We spent a ton of time together over the next several weeks, and we seemed to be headed in the same direction.

Then we had a discussion one night about the future, and he said he hadn't been expecting to actually fall for me, and then a few days later, he said that it was early, but he needed to just say it, he had fallen in love with me. Neither situation really required a response from me, and I didn't say it back, but things seemed to be good.

But now... I happened to see his phone the other day when it was charging next to me on the floor where we were sitting. The screen lit up and he had notifications from tinder matches and texts that seemed to be from girls hitting him up. I wasn't snooping, it was literally right there next to me. I didn't say anything, as we haven't had the *what are we* talk yet, but the mood shifted. After a while, he grabbed his phone and disappeared into the bathroom for a while. He asked a little later what was wrong, and I couldn't help it, I started crying and asked what he wanted from our relationship.

He said he isn't looking for anyone else but also doesn't know what our future looks like. He kept saying all those things like ""I have this issue and that issue and you deserve so much better than me, blah blah blah"". I can't imagine telling someone you love them and then being like eh, I'll go hook up with someone else on tinder. That's not me AT ALL. I don't know for sure if that's what's going on, but it seemed like it. Am I being unfair?

We had plans that day to go to a BBQ, where I would be meeting several of his friends for the first time. We had a bit of an argument and sort of threw out the whole well-maybe-we-should-break-up idea, but he insisted that we talk about it and work through it. We went to the party, and his friends had clearly heard about me and seemed pleased to meet me. We had a fun time, and the rest of the night and next day were great.

He went to visit family this weekend, and I've barely heard a word. He's not great at phone/text communication to begin with, but I couldn't help it, I checked his bumble location and he's definitely logged in while there.

I know we haven't had The Official Talk yet. So maybe I'm expecting too much. But I just can't imagine that with how much time we've spent together and the kinds of things he's said to me, that it isn't heading toward a monogamous situation, if it isn't already there. 

Any advice? I've been thinking myself into a massive pit all day and have no one to really talk to about it all, so it's just making me more and more neurotic.",2019-07-08 05:16:10,4,3,relationship_advice

581,cagvcl,pee_pee_princess,Is he ‚Äúthe one‚Äù or should I end it before it gets more serious?,"I‚Äôm not really sure why I‚Äôm posting here but I guess I want an outside opinion about my relationship...

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year now. We have the same friend group and recently our friends have been getting engaged left and right. My boyfriend has begun to talk about marriage and our future together. As we are getting more serious, I want to step back and assess my feelings about the relationship. 

I am unsure if he is ‚Äúthe one‚Äù for me. The positives: he‚Äôs a talented musician, is currently in a band and chasing his dream. He is absolutely crazy about me, treats me very well, and loves to bike with me. However, he has a lot of red flags like drinking too much, is very lazy, and doesn‚Äôt share many of my passions (hiking, climbing, working out). He also does some obnoxious things, like a lot of PDA and making crude jokes. 

Sometimes I think he will make a great husband and then other times, I feel like I‚Äôll be doing most of the work, like being the bread winner, cleaning the house, and taking care of kids. I am in law school right now, so none of these factors play in, but I‚Äôm talking about ten years in the future. 

So help me, should I stay or should I go?

What if he is ‚Äúthe one‚Äù and I can never find someone as accepting as him? I am kind of weird and quirky, but he loves all my weird habits and makes me really happy when I‚Äôm around him. At the same time, I get frustrated when he sleeps in til 2 pm and drinks heavily every weekend. We are in our mid 20‚Äôs, so maybe he will grow out of that? He is best friends with all my best friends, so breaking up with him will likely destroy several relationships. I know I shouldn‚Äôt think about that, but the break up is going to be awful... Does anyone have personal experience with that? I just don‚Äôt know what to do...",2019-07-08 05:14:00,2,1,relationship_advice
582,cagvbo,BL_3146,My husband is verbally abusive and I called him out on it and now I live in a domestic war zone,"I posted before about how I wasn‚Äôt sure about what was happening in my relationship. Someone suggested ‚Äúthe verbally abusive relationship‚Äù and it changed my life. It provided clarity that I didn‚Äôt have before, but it also made my illusion of a relationship come crashing down. 

I feel trapped and no matter what for the foreseeable future we have to live together because neither of us could afford it on our own. Well, actually I probably could but I would need at least $500 in CS which would cover half of daycare and nothing else. He couldn‚Äôt swing that and bills/rent. 

I feel like I fucked up by essentially showing my hand with what I know is happening (abuse) and now it‚Äôs just a gross situation and I don‚Äôt really know what to do. I feel like I should have kept pretending everything was fine a little longer until I had a better plan but I just couldn‚Äôt today. 

It‚Äôs our wedding anniversary. He forgot. He did all of the things he does to me that he knows hurt me (and the book said we‚Äôre abuse) and I just said enough is enough. At first he said ok fine, divorce me. But then he said he was sorry and he wanted to go to therapy and he loves me. Not 4 hours later he‚Äôs back to the same old shit again. Now he‚Äôs accusing me of cheating on him because I‚Äôm calling him out. 

Please just give me your best advice. I feel like the absolute lowest of the low right now. Just unworthy and worthless even though I know I don‚Äôt deserve it. I was badly abused my whole life and I‚Äôve been NC for 5 years. He makes me feel the same way they did and it doesn‚Äôt bother him to hear that. I don‚Äôt know how I got here.

583,cagup4,reallifefuture,How do you save a failing marriage?,"My wife (24f) and I (25m) got married after dating for 5 years. Everything felt right. Everything was working. We lived together for two years prior to the marriage, we shared money without issues, and we got along great. An amazing job opportunity came up, and after talking about it for sometime, we both decided it was the right decision for me to take it. I'd move to the location of the job, and she'd follow 6 months later after tying up loose ends. We had done long distance for a year and a half towards the beginning of our relationship, so we felt we could handle another 6 months. Yet, it seemed that was our mistake. We are about 4/6 months in, and the problems we are facing are just getting worse. It's like we are both growing, just in separate directions. After a conversation during her last visit, she seems like she is becoming apprehensive to make the move. I believe that the issues we are having are small and the long distance is worsening them and making it difficult to work through, and that this would be possible through couples counseling. However, if things continue to go downhill, then we may not ever get the chance to work through things.

What things can I do now to help start pointing things back in the right direction for us before its too late? I know people change as they get older and we married relatively young, but that shouldn't stop people from working through things and learning to be happy together.

586,cagu6n,Peppertruth,"I need to get away from my family in order to live my life, but I have no idea how.","For a bit of background, I am 20-year-old woman, and I have been living with my mother and stepfather due to the fact I lost my leg when I was 17 and ended up in a bad place mentally about it. Because of this, I screwed myself over in dropping out of school my senior year and never learning how to drive. As of now, I feel stuck in the situation I am in, and have been for the past year. I've devoted most of my time to writing and playing online games, in which, the only people I really talk to are there. I do not want to say my relationship with my family is abusive, or toxic, but it is far from ideal, in my opinion.  As of now, my mother (39) is drunk anytime after she gets home from work, my stepfather(38) is and has always been dead beat, coming home and ignoring everyone in favor of watching movies or playing Minecraft on his iPad, and I have a volatile 13-year-old sister that has a habit of lashing out and screaming if she does not get her way. I also have two younger siblings, an 8-year-old brother, and a 10-year-old sister, but they do not do much outside of going to the park, watch youtube or play video games, normal kid stuff. My mother expects me to do pretty much all the chores around the house because I'm an adult, and is constantly nagging at me to get a job, even though the last two jobs I had she made me quit because she needed help at home. My mother constantly brings up how I do not do enough for the family, though literally anything involving being a parent is done by me after she gets drunk. I make dinner, I do the dishes, do laundry, clean the living room and kitchen and whatever else because she does not do any of that. I cannot live my life because I am far too busy helping her live her life, and I cannot stand to do it any longer.  


Since summer began and I have been basically the only one helping the kids while my parents work during the day, I have been losing my mind desperately and wanting to step away and live my own life, but I do not know where to start. Nearly all the money I made while working went to helping my family pay bills and buy groceries, so I have no savings, I do not own a car, and I do not have a GED or anything. I have tried to get my GED but my mother pulled out of the adult school that had a program to help me get it because, again, she does not want to do her job as a mother and expects me to do as much. Part of me wants to leave simply to help her realize she needs to step up, but most of it is because so long as I am in the house, I am going nowhere in life. I live in Utah, and a longtime friend (22M) has offered me a place to stay in Texas, but I have no way of getting there. On top of that, I have three snakes and I do not want to leave them in the care of my family, because I know they would not take care of them and I do not want my babies to suffer. I have considered reaching out to my birth father, but the last time I tried he simply shrugged me off and told me just to get my GED and drivers license and then get a job and move out, completely ignoring the fact that my mother will not let me. Were it that I could fund classes or pay for the GED test myself, I would, but I do not have a job, and though by God have I tried, I cannot seem to get a job. I know if I leave she will guilt me, or worse, get the police involved, but I cannot remain in this home if I actually want to live my own life.   


TLDR: I am tired of doing the job of my mother and being treated like a burden despite all I do, and if ever I want to live my life and not her's I need to get away and actually live life, but I do not know how to get away. I need advice on how to step away from my family and breathe without the aid of a personal vehicle to take me somewhere else.",2019-07-08 05:10:05,4,1,relationship_advice
587,cagu1a,SingleUseNym,I (47M) am trying to figure out how much physical attraction matters and not hurt my (44F) girlfriend,"Cross-posted from /r/relationships. Throw away account, for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr tl;dr If you are utterly enamored with every other aspect of someone, should you stay if physical attraction is not strong, or even if you are at times unattracted?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel guilty even posting this. I'm sure a proportion (if not most) of you will think I'm an asshole and incredibly misguided, and I understand that - I'm just at a dilemma and I've been spinning my head over it for such a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been dating a woman for a fairly long time now. We met through mutual friends. Despite my age I do not have a big history of dating - I married fairly young (divorced after a long marriage), and have otherwise had only a few other long term relationships that did not work out for reasons completely different than this one (in those other relationships, we just were not compatible personalities, which ultimately led to breakups). So I understand that this question may seem naive or stupid, but please also understand that I do not have the ""normal"" history of serial dating in my teens and 20s, with multiple people, figuring myself out, what works for me and what works for them, etc. For some reason, the people I have dated have ""stuck"" and all turned into long term (e.g. multi-year) relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

The woman I am seeing now is extremely compatible from a personality perspective. I love every aspect of her to pieces from that perspective. I can genuinely say she is the best person I have ever met. No, I'm not putting her on a pedestal. She's not perfect, she gets irritated at things sometimes that maybe she shouldn't, all of the normal human foibles. But those are small things and are essentially irrelevant in the grand scheme of things - she is incredibly kind, warm, and sweet. She's funny, outgoing, compassionate, and just amazing as a person. Further, we just click from a personality standpoint. No real fights. Nothing that even feels like a suppressed fight, where we're clearly irritated but not communicating just to avoid fighting. We just get along well, and enjoy each other's company (at least I do, and she says the same about me - I can only listen to what she says, and not read her mind). We have spent a lot of time together, done trips, etc. Enough so that I do not think that part is artificial or shallow. We have a good basis to know each other, and know that we enjoy being around each other more than any other person we've been with. I feel like I can be open and honest with her about anything. I genuinely love this woman from an emotional perspective. I think she is wonderful.

&amp;#x200B;

Except this - there are times when I struggle with finding her attractive all the time. This isn't just ""hey, we don't always look good in the morning,"" type of stuff, or that I expect her to always look perfect or something like that. The primary issue is probably that she is fairly overweight. It's not 5' 300 lbs overweight, but it's also not just 10-20 pounds too much. She tries, she exercises, but at the end of the day, she has some features like a fairly big gut, double chin, etc. I don't want to go into too much detail because I feel like I'm excoriating her, but there are a number of physical things that occur from having been too overweight for too long that she has. Honestly, some of these things are going to be problems even if she loses all of the excess weight (just because of the damage that being overweight for an extended period does to skin, etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, there are times that it does not bother me. Plenty of times, in fact. We have a good sex life, and it's not like it is some type of pity sex from me or something. But there are other times when I see it and without intending to, I admit that I just have a negative physical reaction. I feel incredibly guilty for it, but it is there. I don't want the reaction. I objectively know that it is silly. I love her, and I want to fucking skewer my own brain for even thinking something so hurtful about her. She does her best to be healthy, she's not a bad person because she is overweight. But my brain is just fucking stupid (okay, I'm just fucking stupid).

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm also going to admit, there are certain things (e.g. odors) that overweight people have (please don't argue it - there are just folds that sweat more, things like that) that I have some times observed, and when I get a trace of it or detect it, I just get a brief flash of revulsion before I get my stupid fucking brain back under control. It's not poor hygiene or anything like that. It just is what it is.

&amp;#x200B;

So in most situations, this would be obvious - move on, and let this poor woman be with someone who just physically desires her 100% all of the time, 24/7. But I really care about her. I can genuinely say that I thought this physical aspect would go away - I kept seeing her because I thought that the whole ""beauty is only skin deep, and if you love the person, it won't matter"" thing would play out. Or perhaps a better way of saying it, that I would just grow even more physically attracted to her because I find her so emotionally attractive. I still think it could. She's not fundamentally unattractive or hideous to me or something - she has kind, warm eyes, a beautiful face, and when she smiles, it lights my world up. I want to make her happy, I love that smile so much.

&amp;#x200B;

I can honestly say that I don't want to think this way, and I do not want to feel this way. This isn't an issue of ""my brain likes blondes, so don't try to force brunettes, you're not attracted to them."" This is a failing on my part. I don't want it to be the case. I want to fix it. I've been trying to fix it, and fix my head.

&amp;#x200B;

But at the same time, we're at the point where we're clearly moving into ""serious long-term relationship"" status. Decisions have to be made. I don't want to lose her, but I also don't want to be 5 years more down the road, and end up finally leaving because I finally decide we're just not a match in terms of what we find physically attractive. I absolutely care about this woman; I don't want to leave something that could work, but I also don't want to fuck around with her and hurt her. I take the relationship seriously - I want to make it work, but she's also not some experiment to be toyed with. But I have also been around long enough to know a good thing, from a personality perspective. People like her just don't come along. I know this. Emotionally and compatibility-wise, no one I have met even comes close. I am terrified that if I break up with her, I will regret it for the rest of my life. I have told myself that I just need to accept the physical part (and just work to be better about it) and ""pull the trigger"" so to speak and commit to her moving forward. But I am also afraid that might not be a sustainable path. I also worry about being inauthentic to her - again, this is not just about me, and she deserves dignity.

&amp;#x200B;

I am at just a horrible crossroads here, and just do not know what to do. I genuinely love this woman and I do not want anyone else, but I have this stupid reaction to the physical side of things that honestly makes me ashamed of myself.",2019-07-08 05:09:38,6,1,relationship_advice
588,cagtzf,mfwghth,"I‚Äôm feeling harassed, is this enough to take my coworker to HR?","A little backstory. My fianc√© and I broke up a while ago and we were broken up for a little over a month. We decided to work out our differences and talk about what was bothering us and we came to an agreement and decided to get back together. While we were broken up, I decided to go out clubbing with 3 of my mates and my cousin. (We all work at the same place) This guy from work has had a crush on me for a while, (or so people tell me) he has never said anything flirty but he used to be nice and friendly to me. When I went clubbing he happened to be out clubbing as well. My friend told him he wanted to come to the club we were at and I said ok. Didn‚Äôt think much of it.



Fast forward to the end of the night he never came to where we were but we did see him when the club closed and we went to get McDonald‚Äôs. He said I looked pretty and asked if he could buy me food. I politely declined and went back with my friends. Also that night my friend gave this guy my phone number because the guy wanted to message me. I said ok, no big deal right. 



He started texting me and even ringing me, and then he got my Snapchat where he would mainly Snapchat me. He was a bit shy but flirty, I don‚Äôt think I ever flirted with him but I don‚Äôt know, he might‚Äôve took my niceness as flirting. We would exchange messages and mainly talk about our day. He‚Äôs never asked me out on a date we would talk like friends, he did ask me to come out clubbing with him again but I was too sick and declined. 



Now we get back to the present. There is this other guy at work who has had problems with my fianc√©. He has a big mouth and loves to gossip and just stir things. He also makes up a lot of things. He‚Äôs basically a mean high school girl except he‚Äôs like a 40 year old men. 


Anyways this man told my partner that I was messaging this other guy, which was no biggie. My partner knew about it. But then he started to tell my partner to watch out because this other guy was onto me. My partner just ignored him. On Friday the guy once again told my partner that I was sending the other guy nudes on Snapchat and that we were planning on meeting up and having sex after work when my partner wasn‚Äôt home and that is 100% not true. My partner ignored him once again but decided to question me about it. I was highly offended and told him I would never do that to him. I am just wondering if this is enough to take this guy to HR over? I am honestly waiting until he says more things so I can have enough evidence and have my partner as witness. He has also said other things before to my partner that were fabricated. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the other guy that‚Äôs telling this guy these things but this could potentially ruin my relationship.

589,cagtyx,WarmGazelle,"I [26/F] feel like I'm being ghosted by one of my best friends [28/F] before her wedding, even though she's asked me to be in it; I'm confused and hurt and don't know what to do.","Hi everyone. This is a bit lengthy so I will clarify anything I'm needed to.

Kate and I met in high school and we have remained friends since then. We ended up going to separate colleges but still stayed in touch and remained friends, still hung out, saw each other (albeit more rarely given the distance), overall were still friends. Throughout this time I got married (last year) and Kate became engaged to her current fiance who is her high school sweetheart.

Kate's fiance (Larry) has changed a lot since high school and not necessarily for the better. He's been negging her, he's used her for money, and he's potentially cheated on her (he slept in the same bed as a girl who he said he was attracted to, but said they were ""just sleeping,"" and even informed Kate of this. Kate was uncomfortable with it and he told her in so many words to ""get over it and trust him."") Given this, my and my husbands opinion of Larry has gone down. I have never said any of this directly to Kate; the things I have done are: Call out when he negs her, call out when he's being shitty to her, and basically tell her that it's not right that he's crossing boundaries that are making her uncomfortable, and not giving a shit about those boundaries (the bed thing). Nothing has changed. Larry is also still friends with my ex, an abuser, a man who has threatened to kill me on 3 separate occasions, not just to me but to others; Larry thinks that I'm overreacting when I tell him that I don't feel safe around him (my ex). There's other things he's done but to be honest I don't want to get into it as it's really lengthy. Otherwise as far as Kate is concerned we like her fiance and are friends with him.

Two years ago when my husband and I got married we did not include Larry in our wedding party (he was invited to the wedding), but we did include Kate. I also wanted to meet up with the wedding party before the wedding just to go out for drinks or something; we didn't have an engagement party or a bachelor/ette party due to logistics and timing, so I really just wanted this to be something for the bridal party. Larry threw a fit that he wasn't invited (I got this info from the best man); He said I was a bad friend, that he should be invited, that he ""came all this way"" for the wedding, etc. I never ended up going out with my bridal party before the wedding because the night I tried to go out he (Larry) made me so stressed that I didn't leave my hotel room. He even tried inviting my siblings to go out with him that night as opposed to hanging out with me (they didn't go though). I'm frustrated about it to this day, but what's done is done. I ended up having an amazing wedding in spite of him being there, and it will always be one of, if not the happiest days of my life. 

About a week after my wedding, Larry and Kate got engaged; since then they've been planning the wedding for about a year. Kate told me a few months ago that I would be in the wedding, specifically as either the MoH or a Bridesmaid; I told her I'd be honored to be either, and she said she just wanted to ask me in person. I said I was looking forward to it; but now I feel like it's not going to happen, and I'm frustrated that Kate isn't being straight with me.

In about 2 weeks I'm going to be in the city where Kate works; in the past we'd discussed meeting up for lunch or something in that city when I'm up there. Now the last two times I've asked her about meeting up she's said that she's unsure if we can meet, and she's left me on read. Basically every conversation we've had has been on her end has her giving short answers, or just leaving the conversation without any sort of warning. I asked her a few weeks ago if she was upset with me and she insisted that she wasn't. This just doesn't seem accurate considering I can't get a straight answer out of her. 

I just want the truth. If she doesn't want me in the wedding anymore, fine, but just tell me rather than drag it out like this; if she's upset with me for not including Larry (or if Larry/his mother planted that idea in her head--his mother holds grudged and was apparently also upset that he wasn't included) then fine, but just let me know. 

I guess I'm hurting and trying to navigate this situation and I don't know how. It feels like I'm losing a friends and I very well may be. Maybe it's my own fault and I shouldn't have called Larry out for his shit; maybe I should have just had him be a part of the wedding. Idk. I'd just really appreciate some guidance because I'm lost right now, and sad, and I don't know what to do.

It hasn‚Äôt always been this way, just the past two weeks. I‚Äôm getting really moody all of sudden. He can tell when I‚Äôm upset and always does his best to make me feel better, and never fails to do just that.

I know it‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm emotional immature and I know it. I love him, he‚Äôs amazing and I don‚Äôt want to lose him or make him feel unloved. 

I really appreciate any advice.",2019-07-08 05:06:05,9,1,relationship_advice

593,cagsfq,Lyst83,My daughter doesn‚Äôt want to be friends with her friend anymore.,"I‚Äôll try my best to make this concise, and in short my 10 y/o daughter does not want to be friends with her ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù anymore. Her friend, lets call her Gabby, texts me often to see if my daughter can play or if she can spend the night. Gabby has a phone and my daughter does not. I just keep telling her that we‚Äôre busy but I‚Äôm starting to feel bad. 

However, I‚Äôm also a little relieved because Gabby isn‚Äôt supervised very well on her tablet or on her phone and is allowed unrestricted and unchecked access to certain social media apps that my ex and I have made off limits to our daughter. Specifically, I‚Äôm talking about apps like Tik Tok where Gabby is making videos of herself singing or dancing around and just about anyone can contact her about them. We are just not on board with that shit and when we found out that our daughter used the app at Gabby‚Äôs house we weren‚Äôt happy about it. 

I spoke with my daughter about why she doesn‚Äôt want to play with Gabby anymore and it seems to stem from being in the same class for the second year in a row. Gabby, according to my daughter, often ditches her to play with other kids and other groups at recess and my daughter kind of feels like a friend of convenience. She also says that Gabby plays a lot of pranks on her and isn‚Äôt that nice to her. I was never more proud of my kid than when she said to me, ‚ÄúIf Gabby was really my friend, she wouldn‚Äôt treat me that way.‚Äù 

I figured that letting their friendship fade away might be the best route, so as not to hurt Gabby‚Äôs feelings or put my daughter in a position where she has to have a confrontation about not wanting to be Gabby‚Äôs friend anymore. I don‚Äôt want to make her a target for bullying because she‚Äôs hurt Gabby‚Äôs feelings by rejecting her. So I guess I‚Äôm not sure how to handle it? Gabby texts me up to 4 times a week and I just keep saying we‚Äôre busy. I‚Äôm not sure this is a good strategy?",2019-07-08 05:04:27,11,1,relationship_advice
594,cagrn5,willyouacceptmyrose,My [31f] inability to stop worrying about our future compatibility is ruining the relationship,"I can‚Äôt seem to stop worrying about the many reasons why my SO could be  incompatible in the long term and it‚Äôs causing so much anxiety that I‚Äôve begun to unintentionally sabotage the relationship. Help!

SO and I get along really well in person. He makes me laugh and brings out my goofy side. We have deep convos. The sex is phenomenal. 
 
But, some of his biggest interests are ones that I don‚Äôt share, and that means I often second guess whether he‚Äôd be happier with someone into what he‚Äôs into. 

We also live 1.5 hours apart, which means seeing each other maybe twice a week. Again, when we are together, it‚Äôs so good. But apart, I feel like we don‚Äôt connect as much. Part of it is what I mentioned above (he doesn‚Äôt share much about his day because he thinks I won‚Äôt be interested), part of it is he‚Äôs not into texting, and part of it is because he is unemployed and I work, so I‚Äôll be up at 7am and not hear from him until 2pm when he wakes up (which by then feels like I‚Äôve spent half of my day not hearing from him which feels shitty). 

I feel like I keep letting hypothetical future stuff get in my mind when we are apart like how we could never do long distance or how I can‚Äôt imagine raising kids with someone who takes so long to text back, or how it seems like he could easily find a better fit for him than me, but he insists I‚Äôm the one he wants. He gets sad that I ‚Äúbring up breaking up preemptively out of fear of breaking up later‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt be more happy with how good things are in the present instead of dwelling on future stuff.

Tl;dr How do I not let my anxiety towards the future get in the way of the present?",2019-07-08 05:01:49,4,2,relationship_advice
595,cagrg8,sainteclair,I suffer from bouts of unhappiness in my relationship. I don‚Äôt know how much time to give myself.,"I‚Äôm [19f] in a 10mo relationship with this guy [23m] I met during his senior year of college. I was a sophomore. A lot has happened between now and then, such as major career changes, personal traumas. We have stuck together despite all these struggles, but even then I struggle with myself.

I am incredibly unhappy. I‚Äôm unhappy because I‚Äôm unhappy and I don‚Äôt know how to be happy again. I can‚Äôt quite understand the source of this unhappiness‚ÄîI just know that sometimes I feel so withdrawn, I‚Äôm easily triggered, and I struggle to control it. After that it‚Äôs a very aggressive cycle.

I have had my fair share of good and bad relationships. Don‚Äôt get me wrong! I‚Äôve been in a 2 year relationship that was fully abusive, and it damaged me. After that, I had a 1 year relationship with someone who I‚Äôve never ever felt so happy to be with and made me see what a healthy relationship should look like. Now I‚Äôm here, at this relationship.

There are periods in this relationship where it‚Äôs pure bliss and I don‚Äôt have to worry about anything, and then there are times like now where I really begin to doubt purpose in the relationship.

I don‚Äôt like to blame these things on anyone, but sometimes I feel like these feelings are rooted more deeply in past experiences I‚Äôve had with my partner in the 10 months we‚Äôve been together.

There was a time once where he shut me out of his life for a week after I sent him a text about my concerns about not getting enough attention, and after that I couldn‚Äôt completely forget it (I never let it hang over our heads). I don‚Äôt want to blame it on the fact that I see him only once or twice a week for 4 hours max. I like to believe that this is just personal preference that I‚Äôd like to be able to see someone more often. I am just scared to ask for anything for him anymore because he often declines and because of that first experience where he had basically ghosted me for a week.

I don‚Äôt know how much time to give myself to come to conclusions on what I want. Should I leave and spare myself or stay and work on the problems?  I‚Äôm not the type to jump the gun, but some days the pain is just intolerable, and I‚Äôm begging myself to just end it.

Therapy is not an option. I don‚Äôt have funds to do these things. I‚Äôm just not sure how to manage my feelings anymore. Maybe I‚Äôm just dating the wrong person?

tl;dr spontaneously unhappy in current relationship, but not sure how to manage these feelings.",2019-07-08 05:01:12,1,1,relationship_advice
596,cagqhp,Apothnesko,"My partner (21) and I (20) live in an apartment with my sister (24) and her boyfriend (24), who do nothing and I dont know what to do!","I have lived with my sister for about 2 years and it was good for the most part, we have lived together through various roommates and it was going well until this most recent move. I did not want to move with my sister and she was aware of it, I shared with her that my partner and I were thinking about moving into our own place after the lease ran out. After a week of moping around and a lot of her crying I decided that for now I would move with my sister and later on I would move out, turns out that was the wrong decision. My sister found out out that leasing a new car and a new tablet will put you out of a lot of money, so I ended up having to pay for the whole deposit, yet both of our names are on the lease, and somehow she got the master bedroom. 

After we have been in the new place for a few weeks and put the majority of the stuff except for a pile in the kitchen. I knew that i had already put away the majority  of the house so I figured my sister was just taking her time getting to it, but no. A week or so later when I ask her about it she glares at me and says ""you know you can put away some stuff too"" and I told her I did put away alot of the stuff, and then she threw a little fit and went to her room. This is how it goes EVERY SINGLE TIME I ask her to do something, doesnt matter what she will figure a way to pin the blame on me, and then throw a huge fit because how dare I accuse her of anything.

Fast forward to a few days ago, I asked her to help out with the dishes and to keep up on their cat's litter box (record is 2 weeks so far without cleaning) so that we can monitor our elderly cat with a failing kidney. And she looks at me disgusted, and says ""well I never make any dishes, I never cook, I order out all the time."" Come on dude, that's mostly true but they still add to the dish pile. And then she gets angry at me for cleaning our own cat's litter box too often! I dont know how to put up with this any more and I'm pretty sure I can't. She's older than me but most of the time I feel like I have to take care of her all the time, and its like dealing with a child! 

I don't know what to do and I feel dumb for getting so upset about this, but shes my sister, I feel like shes betrayed my trust and doesnt give a shit about me. I take care of the people and environment aroud me, I dont care whos fault it is, its not hard. The worst part about the whole situation is that she owes me $1000+ from the security deposit, past rent, and a few other bills and I dont want to leave really until I get that back.",2019-07-08 04:58:17,9,2,relationship_advice

598,cagq7s,Throwaway51394,Should I(25M) get back together with my GF(24F)???,"Hi everyone. I am looking for any guidance or words of wisdom about the situation with my now ex-gf that led to our breakup, and wondering if I should get back together with her. If you want more info, you can look through many of my past posts in this sub or other relationship subs.

In short, the relationship was very toxic in many ways but also very fun and exciting when it was good, like a rollercoaster. It was so amazing at first, it started as the best and most fun and loving relationship I‚Äôve ever had. We were together for two years. Feel free to look at past posts to see the drama that went on, but in short, after the first few months, she started not always treating me with respect, she would insult me when she was angry, would flirt with other guys over social media or in person, would try to control me and get overly jealous, threaten to fuck other guys, blocking me when slightly angry, silent treatment, etc, all of this unfolding over two years. This is not to say I was perfect at all, as I could get jealous and angry, but usually in response to her hurtful words or flirting or threatening to download tinder or threatening to fuck other guys. Whereas her jealous was not really founded on anything I was doing, more so she felt insecure.

Back in the end of March, she and I had a roadtrip planned to go to CO. But the two weeks before, she had broken up with me and blocked me because I didn't want to share a certain facebook post that was talking about one of my female professors (I was in graduate school at the time) who had some allegations of saying sexist things. This professor had already been fired and her husband was my advisor and so I didn't want to burn any bridges. So she had ""broken up"", like many times before, but this time was much longer, lasting two weeks.  During this time, I had sex with someone else one time. I did not intend to get back together with her, as her mean words and dumping me felt like a last straw.  

So after the two weeks, she tried to get back together to go on our roadtrip but I cancelled the trip. I tried to end the relationship right then, but she threatened to kill herself and was cutting herself so much, and so I caved to that manipulation and didn't break up. I was too much of a coward to tell her that I had sex with someone else, as she is very mentally unstable and I was worried about what she would do if I told her. I was also planning to end the relationship as soon as possible, trying to mitigate her response. 

During April, I started distancing myself with the excuse of working on my schoolwork and my thesis (this was also true but also an excuse). I saw her maybe once during April. This caused her to be so upset and caused a lot of fighting between us. She started drinking everyday, but by the end of April I had helped her to stop drinking. Then I graduated with my Masters, and during May and June I continued distancing myself by using focusing on my career as an excuse. I saw her once in May and once in June. I was trying to gear up to break up but I also couldn't for some reason, as I deeply love and care for her and also I have been addicted to our very strong sexual connection, but my logical mind was telling me the drama would only get worse and I needed to get out, plus I never told her I had been with someone else. But my heart didn't want to. All of this reusing to see her made her(and me) so upset and caused many fights. I felt so terrible for upsetting her and causing her to drink so much during April. I was(am) so depressed about it.

Fast forward to this past weekend. We had bought tickets months ago to go to a festival but I had sold my ticket during April. She spent the next two months trying to convince me to buy another ticket and go with her but I always refused, because I thought we would be broken up by then. But I never was able to end it. 

Right before the festival, we got into an argument about something small but I started trying to talk about breaking up again and she got mad and said some mean words about my father, who died 8 months ago,  and she knows his death has been very hard on me. This sent me over the edge and I was so mad that I told her I wanted to be over. But right before she turned her phone off for the festival, I messaged her that I wish would make this work and I don't want to have to breakup but also said I didn‚Äôt know if we could. And later during the festival she messaged me that she missed me. 

After the festival happened, a mutual friend told me that she had cheated on me during the festival by making out and dancing with a guy. She apparently tried to have sex with him but he refused because he also has a GF. I was so upset that I dumped her and blocked her. But now, three days later I feel so regretful of the last few months. During that time, I felt it was right to distance myself from the relationship even thought my heart still wanted her. But now, I am just wishing I never refused to hang out with her all that time and I wish I never sold my ticket. My heart wants her so badly. If i had not distanced my self and if I had gone to the festival, none of this would have happened and we would still be together. She told me she tried to have sex with that guy because ""we weren't good and you said you didn‚Äôt know if we could make it work and I didn't know if we would stay together.""

So that basically means it is all my fault and I could have avoided this. I am just going completely crazy about this and I am looking for any input. Was this all my fault? Did I make the right choice in distancing myself and trying to get closer to breaking up? I feel that I was trying to break up but it was too painful in my heart and I couldn't, so I tried to distance myself to make it easier, but now it has led to extreme pain in knowing she had sex with this guy. Did I do the right thing? Or did I fuck up? I am just wishing I didn't refuse to see her all those times because we could have had so much fun together and we would still be together now. 

And now, all I can think about is the beginning of the relationship and how incredibly magical and amazing it was with her. I wish so badly we can get that back, is it possible?? I am just wanting to get back together with her. But I know if I do(is that a terrible idea?) that I will need to be honest that I had sex with someone else when she dumped me three months ago. I am very worried about how extreme her reaction may be, as the person I had sex with is someone she feels very jealous of. Any input is appreciated, thanks.

TL;DR: been with my girlfriend for two years, and she has been very mean and abusive but also the relationship has been very magical, exhilarating, and fun and exciting.  She dumped me for two weeks back in April, and I had sex with someone else, and when we got back together I wasn‚Äôt able to be honest out of fear of her reaction(potentially hurting herself). I have been distancing myself for the last three months trying to get closer to ending it, and finally did when she cheated on me, but now that it‚Äôs over I feel nothing but regret and am wondering if I‚Äôve done the right thing, because my heart just wants her so badly.  My urge is to get back together with her and be honest about having sex with someone else back in April, but is that a very stupid decision?? It feels like even if I have great sex with someone else, that it will never feel as connected or magical as it does with my ex. Thanks in advance.",2019-07-08 04:57:21,5,1,relationship_advice
599,cagpzf,Hertogjan1337,A new relationship is scary,"Hello! Long time lurker, first time poster here.

Yeah so me (M/27) was engaged for 2 years to a very abusive woman. It started off all good, and later after I proposed (3 years into the relationship) she started beating me up alot before. I broke up 2 months before the wedding. I've been single ever since. 

Now im getting into a new relationship and it scares the hell out of me. I 'm head over heels but I can't control the fact that I don't believe a thing she says. It's driving me insane, and I don't know what to do. She seems genuine, but at the same time I question everything.

We videocalled today for nearly 3 hours as she's on the other side of the world atm for a while. During the videocall all was fine, better than fine. But the moment we hung up all the doubt started creeping in again. A doubt that I just can't believe she would like me, someone who is quite obviously broken and just not the best person in general.

Any tips on how to deal with it?

Tldr; Im in a new relationship after previous abusive relationship. I don't allow myself to be happy because of my self esteem. Any tips?",2019-07-08 04:56:26,8,2,relationship_advice
600,cagpy1,anxiousspacecadet,My relationship is getting serious and I don't know what I want.. help.,"So my boyfriend (28m) and I (25f) have been together for a year. We have been living with each other for half that time now and speak about the future regularly... we are very happy together and love each other very much, but I am worried we have different views on children. Not sure... having kids or not having kids is a huge deal. 

He has never even thought about having kids, hasn't been anything that gives him joy. I honestly feel like I don't want kids either, haven't for awhile (mostly because kids can be so draining and a serious financial burden). 

However all my life before being an actual adult, I have always thought that I would have children.. always assumed I would have a huge family. 
I guess now that I'm older I see all the reasons why not to have children (maybe I just thought I had to have children as some social norm). It's just that now I'm worried that some day I might regret not being a mom. 

Right at this moment, 25, I feel like I don't want kids ever. I'm just worried that some day I will feel differently or maybe regret my decision. (People say you usually regret things you never tried more than the the things you have tried). This in my opinion would be a huge problem if I was with someone who never wanted children. But on the other hand if I talk about it with my boyfriend, I don't want him to feel like maybe there is this huge obstacle in our way when it may never be a problem. 

I guess I need to do some soul searching but I wanted to ask reddit first. 
Again, I love this man. Right now I feel like my life with him is all I need.",2019-07-08 04:56:18,6,1,relationship_advice

602,cagow3,LightInsideTheDark97,A story of unchained love,"I'm new to this. 
So I'll start by saying hello.
I'm  a 22 year old dude really trying to figure life out. 
The road so far hasn't been fun. 
Sometimes I feel like I'm playing with a loaded gun. 
I battle ptsd  major depression n heartbreak. 
Outta all the things in my life I've never felt the way I have about a person until December 31st 2017.
She was younger yes I was 20 she was 17 a 3 year difference but for young adults shits typical I came into this knowing a little about her past n the night we met up for the first time I claimed up. 
It was supposed to be what young dumb fools do jus hook up n fuck.
But something about her caught my attention her story mended me. 
And her eyes changed me..
In that night I felt the air leave my soul outta all the hook ups n past counts I seen something.
It was short lived dew to her having a abusive boyfriend. 
So I kinda felt torn because she went back. 
So dealing with my own issues I re gained myself for some time. 
She started reaching out n I started going back around.
2018 we started sneaking around a little bit just to see each other in the spring. 
I was waiting for her to turn 18 before we did anything sexual wise  but there was vibes there that girls my age n older couldn't captivate me by. 
So we sneak around till we got caught n that got me in trouble n had her boyfriend beat her.
N I had to once again turn away because I was bringing her joy yet I was bringing  her hurt. 
So the lines go cold after months of sneaking around.
We go our on ways n I was left thinking how she was. 
2019 comes in and I find myself on the bathroom floor trying to forget those damn eyes.
I was slowly picking myself up in the same old ways I know best substance. 
So she slept around trying to get away from this guy. 
But at the end of it all spring 2019 she's talking to me again. 
At this point I let her back in and honestly we got closer  than ever.
We spent every day of time together n honestly seeing her smile n keeping her safe made me feel alive.
It was the warmth of her being safe. 
But the month and weeks we spent I also was fighting my mental as well  sober 100% sober dealing with flash backs n lashing out. 
I slowly started seeing I the webs. 
I couldn't shake the feeling of guilt n self hate for ever leaving. 
But I told her at the end of the day if it was keeping or you John doe. 
You'd go with him.
Lotta tears n Lotta lies was said on both parts. 
But the truth outta my past n my heart for her was pure. 
I ended up in the same loop. 
Now here I am thinking about her trynna gain all I can for myself. 
It hurts it hurts so bad cause the energy. 
The love the nights we slept in each others arms was onesided. 
I took her off facebook but have her on other sights n have her number. 
We've spoken some and I'm still hurting I'm just doing the best I can. 
The thought of her hurt haunts me. 
The thought of her getting beat so bad stabs my heart. 
She don't deserve all the shit she is going thru n I never meant to drive her away...
She's practically 10 minutes away... 
I don't know what to do anymore people tell me man fuck her dude let her go. 
But she's got this pull that makes things better n brings light in this dark.
Our paths are on a same level n I don't wanna lose her as a friend at all. 
N I'm afraid. 
Like she wants the same thing n seeing the shit happen  to another female I care for makes me hurt. 
So I'm dangling in the wind  I won't hold out for her. 
I can't. 
Im seeking myself out now and doing me the age gap  is a fact I wanna do life she's learning as am I. 
But I jus wanna see her shine.... 
N I see it in the photos n videos the lake trips the kisses. 
Everything that brought me peace of mind now cuts with the past n damage. 

I love her outta all 23 she was the last.. 
I don't care about the rep.
But she's the first that caught me off n to he younger strong but dumb smart funny but keeps falling.
What do I do... 
What can I do... 
She means so much to me...

Her facial expressions felt like she meant it and she didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just joking.‚Äù 
Then she started acting weird toward me after that excluding me from stuff and talking to me less. We were super close and I thought she was my best friend for life. Weirdly, at the same time she started spending her time with this guy who she said she had no romantic interest in.

604,cago8s,embrsd_n_noisy_kisr,kissing etiquette,"Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I'm sorry if this isn't the right sub to be asking.

I (27f) was in a LTR with another woman for over 5 years, but that ended about a year ago.  Our sex life wasn't good, and she didn't like kissing or being kissed at all even though it was very important to me.  After our relationship ended, I went on a few dates that didn't really go anywhere but just tried to have fun and keep things light. I never went on more than 1 or 2 dates with any of them.  A couple weeks ago, I went on a third date with someone and we had a first kiss/major makeout sesh.  She and I saw each other a few times after that, and during one of those times she mentioned that I made little moan sounds during our first kiss but didn't say much more about it.  I didn't do this on purpose and I don't even remember making sounds at all, so I was too surprised and embarrassed to say anything about it then. Things ended on bad terms a few days ago due to series of misunderstandings, and I'd like to go on dates again but I think I'm nervous about kissing now.  I've heard people say that it's a turn on for them when their bf or gf moans during kissing, but I've also heard people say it's weird and creepy, especially when it's the first kiss or someone that isn't a young/teen anymore.  Like I mentioned above, kissing is important to me and it's been a long time since it's something I really got to enjoy so I really want to go out there without being self conscious about it.

605,cago3n,JasperAlice6,Does he want to date me or not?,"
Okay so there‚Äôs this guys I‚Äôve been talking to on and off for about 9months. We met on social media. He‚Äôs really attractive and flirtatious af. He‚Äôs made it clear that he‚Äôs attracted to me. But the thing is.. he hasn‚Äôt asked me out. I‚Äôve given him so many hints about hanging out and chilling but he ignores them. We talk on and off about basic things. He doesn‚Äôt like talking about his personal life (I always have to pry it out of him) and he never asks me of mine. Or seems to care. I remember once I got super frustrated because he was getting my hints but never did anything about them so I assumed he was lowkey already in a relationship but he lol‚Äôd at it and denied it. 
We would sometimes see one another out in public and he would completely go on his way and ignore it but then message me a few hours later saying he saw me &amp; I would straight up ask why he wouldn‚Äôt come up and say hi &amp; he would always say he was either shy, with friends, or that he‚Äôs awkward.
I‚Äôm also a visible Muslim girl. He‚Äôs super white. Do y‚Äôall think maybe that has something to do with it? Is he afraid that others will see him with a muslim girl? He never asks about my beliefs nor does he seem interested in understanding it. He‚Äôs clearly not afraid of Muslims or ignorant because he wouldn‚Äôt be talking to me if he was.  
I guess what I‚Äôm saying is.. does he like me? Like genuinely? Or Am I wasting my time? I mean I basically already wasted 9months with him thinking it would get somewhere.
 should I stop talking to him? Do you think he‚Äôs genuinely shy and most likely has social anxiety? Am I overthinking this?",2019-07-08 04:50:34,1,1,relationship_advice
606,cago3b,jpmademedoit,UNREQUITED LOVE WITH MY BEST FRIEND OF 3 YEARS,"Hello! I need some love advice (lame I know, but I'm genuinely stuck).

Long story short; when I was 15 (3 three years ago), I met a boy we will call N (who was 19 at the time) and I very very quickly caught feels for him. Gosh, I fell in love with this dude fast. We had a lot of confusing shit happen between us, but basically, we were nothing more than best friends with benefits (mainly because of our age gap and his commitment issues). We ended up having a falling out, and not speaking for almost six months, and in that time I got into a new relationship and thought I had moved on, but alas I had not gotten over N. N and I started talking again, and once my relationship with the other boy ended, N and I's friendship got very close and I thought that maybe it was finally our time to give us a try. Did that happen? Of course not! He ended up getting into a relationship with a girl with a horrible bondage tattoo and they are still together to this day. N and I's friendship was great for the first few months of his relationship, and although I am in love with him, I decided to put that aside because his friendship and happiness was more important to me.  
But now I am at a point where I'm unsure if I can hide it anymore. He has been a really shitty friend for the past few months and part of me just wants to scream at him and tell him how much I love and adore him and another part of me just wants to block him everywhere and try to move on (although I've tried that before and it didn't work)

Please help! I am in love with this boy and have been for 3 years. He is my best friend, soulmate and biggest support. If I tell him, it will most likely ruin our friendship and drive a wedge between him and his gf (who hates me anyway). But I cannot hide it anymore, every time I'm around him recently I just wanna either scream at him or kiss him, which obviously cannot do.  
Any advice would be much appreciated xoxo",2019-07-08 04:50:32,3,1,relationship_advice
607,cago34,endgame2005,Does she like me?,"Girl at job and I have had like a back and forth-roast kind of relationship. Playful endless insults thrown back and forth but I feel she might like me but at the same time there‚Äôs some evidence that this could just be me misinterpreting things.

When I was explaining something to her a week ago, she mentioned‚Äùbtw, did you see my green panties when you were there? Just curious cuz I have grannie panties lmfao. Just kidding it‚Äôs a thong‚Äù

And last week as I‚Äôm looking at her while explaining a procedure, I was making a lot of extra extra eye contact. She said why did I look at her so much when I should be looking at the computer screen while explaining things. I told her I didn‚Äôt need to look at the screen to explain or know what I‚Äôm doing to which she said ‚Äúok then. I want you to look at me and not look anywhere else and explaining it all‚Äù. I explained everything  perfectly to which she acknowledged a ‚Äòwow‚Äô kinda body language.

The other day she made a bad comment and I playfully called her a bitch, to which she acted hurt. It was weird cuz she kept smiling and saying she didn‚Äôt take it serious but at the same time she was really in shock I called her that. She was acting in disbelief whilst acknowledging she knew it was me playing. That was weird.

We look at each other, and I would say sometimes our eye contact is a little over what you would call normal. But again, idk. She‚Äôs never truly flirted with me or given me her number. She keeps saying how I‚Äôm an asshole and plain rude. And she‚Äôs a very friendly person and everyone likes her so I could be blowing this a little out of proportion. She‚Äôll say hi in a chat to me in the morning if I don‚Äôt say anything but that‚Äôs it. She also has not added me on Snapchat either. She‚Äôs Always mocking me and shit which leads me to believe that she just sees me as a brother type. But then she‚Äôll do something weird like come over to my desk to ask for help and while explaining the problem her thigh will be slightly touching mine. She also asked me to touch her cuz it was raining so that I could see how her blouse was wet. But then again the blouse was on top of her work dress and it‚Äôs not like She asked me to touch her body parts like chest or back so it could simply be just that cuz I know females can be non sexual.

What should I do next?,"My sister (30F), just called her Anne and me (27F) has a very estranged relationship now.. I moved across the country 2 years ago and meet her briefly once or twice a year when I visit my parents. I didn't talk with her after the latest fight 6 months ago. She unfriend me on FB since then too. Few days ago, she give me friend add request and I accept it. I guess Anne comes to her sense and want to make amen and I more than welcome it so I accept her request.

&amp;#x200B;

But this morning she just DM and ask me to send her my picture and the photo of my ID card ( US equivalent may be Social Number, I think). ID card in my country is something you can use to aboard domestic flight, open bank account, etc.). When I ask why she needs MY ID, she explain that she wants to join some sort of online selling groups which need to verify the account using to register. I found it ridiculous and politely decline her by answering "" I don't feel comfortable to give my ID card detail to some unauthorized people. No one can guarantee bout the safety of not using it for bad purpose"". She left the message in read and doesn't talk to me anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't not bent to her unreasonable request and she should respect my decision. But I want to save this relationship somehow. What should I do next?

&amp;#x200B;

Story of the fight:  I was forced to move out of my renting house in very short notice and my deposit was hold on for two week due to bank policy ( details doesn't matter here), so I was run out of cash for a round 300 dollars, which is about 1/3 of my monthly salary. So I asked Anne to borrow some money and promised to pay back with interest when I received the salary next month. It was worth notice that it was my first time borrow her ever since I got a job.

&amp;#x200B;

She kinda promised to lend me the money but after few days I didn't received any. I texted her few times and called her to asked if she send it yet. She left me in read and ignored my calls. Few close friends lend my their money and everything settle then. Few weeks she texted me to asked if I still need to borrow money. I texted her that I figured out on my own and sarcastically thanks for her help. She texted back that I only talk to her when I need her help. She unfriend my right after that.  I was heart broken and resented her since then. I went no contact with her ever since.

610,cagnc5,melka832,I Can‚Äôt seem to make and follow a decision. Torn up with guilt and anxiety.,"I (48 M )was a faithful husband and financial provider for twelve plus years to my ex wife. I was also a great father to her son from  a previous marriage. Now he is a well adjusted  very successful young man who works with me at the same company. 
we also have a  beautiful loving  15 year old son together, our son suffered from uncontrollable seizures for about 2 years between ages of 10-12,  We were able, by the grace of god,  to finally get his seizures under control, It took years of being  in and out of hospitals on a daily or weekly basis. He has some  learning, speech and other delays in his development, he is  wry social, fun and just a beautiful kind spirit,  I know he will need a lot of attention and support going forward into adult hood.

Those medical struggles strained our already frigid relationship and we grew just apart romantically into a brother sister type of relationship , we stayed together because of our sons needs mostly I guess.
She eventually met someone else many years her junior online from her country and remarried him, bringing him to the USA. 

Even after she  asked for a divorce and told me move out, I still supported her financially for a couple years and took care of my son most of the time. I still pay for her car.
She has the  controlling personality type that can be verbally abusive and mean spirited when things are not how she wants them.
She however can  also be a caring mother,  friend and protective mother. I can‚Äôt say she‚Äôs all bad. I play role in the demise of the relationship also,
I let things grow cold and didn‚Äôt hold up my end of the romancing responsibility in our relationship for a long time. I‚Äôm still fairly close to her family and they have always been great to me, they all love our son.

I met eventually someone few months later also, after years of no romance I kind of rushed into a relationship and ended up in a domestic partnership for the past 2.5 yrs. My girlfriend  also has a son around my sons age that has now moved in with us.  He hasn‚Äôt been very endearing to my son, he stays in his room mostly, doesn‚Äôt participate in anything we do. He used to live with his father over seas and that wasn‚Äôt a healthy environment from what I know.

My relationship has been a bit rocky with frequent Spats for the first year and jealousy on her part, snooping in my phone and the like.
 My frequent communication with my ex is a sore spot. She has been loyal and supportive and trying to carve out time for us and my attention.
I just don‚Äôt think  if I feel it as deeply as her.

She works part time, doesn‚Äôt make too much money and doesn‚Äôt contribute financially to major living expenses. I pay the rent, cars, utilities, car insurance etc. I do care for her and we have some intimacy, but don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm in  love, it‚Äôs a bit suffocating and I yearn for some personal space often. I told my ex  the way I felt a few times. I wasn‚Äôt able to go to her families birthdays or holiday gatherings due to the jealousy, I want anyway without telling her and sulked most of the time.

Now My ex is back to being single about six months ago and  her and her family are trying to convince me to move  back to try to start over, to be a family again for our son. She can‚Äôt understand why I would be unhappy and still support another woman and her kid and not be back my own son and family where I belong.

I went along with it initially but as the time got closer I just couldn‚Äôt follow through with it.
It‚Äôs caused me a lot of guilt and anxiety, I‚Äôm torn between and I can‚Äôt bring myself to abandon my girlfriend, I also dread abandonment,  she shows me her care, she claims to love me, it seems sincere, but she also depends on me . 

She has been through some tough breakups in the past as well. She really doesn‚Äôt deserve another one. 
On the other hand, My son could benefit if his mom and I could be a somewhat of a family again. 
Obviously it would take a lot of work and counseling. I don‚Äôt have the romantic feelings at this point. It‚Äôs more of a family thing.
The worst case is I could move on my own and be a bigger part of his daily life in a family environment, 
 I think perhaps we could parent together and go on  vacations as a family, I would not have to deal with drama from my girlfriend and her jealousy issues. I could also save more money for my sons future care if I wasn‚Äôt supporting her.

My feelings swing back and forth from stay, go,  guilt and anxiety, I‚Äôm just lost in this mess.

Other than go find someone else...,"My (24M) ex girlfriend (23F) of 2.5 years broke up with me around 2 months ago and everyday I struggle with the idea that she is gone even though the breakup made me realise a lot about the relationship wasn't healthy. 

No matter how much I write and talk to people about it, I cannot get this thought out of my head, that ive lost such an important part of my life. She pops into my head continuously throughout the day, I get home exhausted, keen to sleep and forget about it and then find myself waking up to extremely detailed dreams involving her. 

The whole story was my first post if you want complete context but to give a quick idea,  we dated for 2.5 years. We spent every weekend together during that time, travelled overseas twice and spent 2-3 nights a week with each other. She struggled with an ED which consumed her for a large period of the relationship and I gave my full support to her, probably too much. My friends have told me I forgot to look after myself and that she never made any effort towards them, that she only accepted what she wanted and would take nothing else and that she focused too much on work, putting in minimal effort to her friends, family and myself.

Even though I have been able to gain this perspective, I still find myself hurting everyday and I don't know what to do or techniques to help me deal with it. How can I deal with this?",2019-07-08 04:47:53,2,1,relationship_advice

614,cagmda,TheCursedOrNot,NSFW My [F20] boyfriend [M22] wants a tighter p*ssy,"Sorry this is long.

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year now and have been friends for about a year and a half. 

This has been a problem topic for me ever since we first had sex. Albeit, in the beginning it was a much smaller problem. Basically, while we were having sex, he was getting close so he said something along the lines of ""make your pussy tighter"" or something like that so I took myself out of the moment and tried. I can say that I didn't try too hard so right after trying I just blurted ""I can't"". For this entire exchange he didnt stop moving or anything so I couldn't give it a real try but that's me looking back on it now. Things ended well and I didn't think twice about it.

For the next couple of days we were very active sexually. He didn't mention anything about me needing to be tighter in that time. I don't remember when he brought it up but I remember a conversation with him about his ex where he explained to me that she could really ""clamp down"" when they were doing it. 

I don't know remember how the conversation got there but ever since he told me this I've started looking in to how I could go about ""tightening up"" and even here and there he would make little comments about kegal exercises and stuff to do that with. He was never pushy about it and once he acknowledged that I seemed to be looking into it thoroughly due to my expanding knowledge on the subject, and he was pleasantly impressed.

So, for the past couple of weeks I've just been doing stuff to strengthen my pelvic floor without having to buy things such as kegal balls. I didn't think they were important enough to buy at the time. Hell, the things were also more money than I was comfortable paying; especially if it was something I might be able to do on my own.

Then we had sex again a few nights ago and I almost cried. We have sex maybe once a month now which kinda sucks bc my sex drive is high and his is very low. This is understandable because I know that I'm not entitled to his body. I ask for ""good touches"" and he normally sates my drive, if you know what I mean. Anyway, I was alright while we were having sex and then he said that, and I'm paraphrasing, if I tighten up that he might be able to come in me but if not that it was okay.

So I end up zoning completely out of it and focusing on this one simple task. It so completely envelops my mind that I put all of my energy into it. I start feeling exhausted and I feel like I can't take it anymore but this fuckin voice in my head tells me to suck it up and not be such a fuckin pussy. That thought triggers something and I feel the start of an anxiety attack. It was making my jaw tremble. It took an incredible amount of emotional control to not burst into tears.

After he finished he got me some paper towels so I didn't get stuff on the sheets and I just couldn't shake the feeling that I didn't do it. I went to the bathroom and saw I had bitten my lip so hard that it was now swollen. I had nail marks in my thighs from gripping so hard. I was embarrassed and I was crying. I went back to his room to be near him. Looking back on it now, I think I needed a hug but I didn't ask for one or say much of anything. I silently cried while sitting on the floor, hugging his dog. He was on his PC playing games and did turn around to ask if I was okay a couple of times. I was always successful at hiding my face each time.
I fell asleep after and felt better

The next day we were at a friends house and we were joking around while they were putting together a TV stand. He said something about if I could tighten up I could get dicked down more or something to that effect. That just about did it. Broke me and what fuckin lies I told myself to keep me happy and sane. I got over my anger in the moment, but now every time he brings up sex or jokes about it or the like, I feel like I'm trying to play a role. Like I'm not real and if I say the wrong thing my world is gonna collapse on me.

I don't think I should, if I even can, have sex anymore without talking to him about this. It's my fault and now I know I failed him and I didn't do what I needed to do to give him what he wanted. I can pretend everything is okay but I don't know how I can keep it up and not break.

How do I approach this topic when I don't even feel comfortable bringing it up? How do I tell him that this is a sensitive subject for me without him thinking that I can't take a joke? What the fuck do I do?",2019-07-08 04:45:04,28,1,relationship_advice

Me- 19M 

Her-19F

To start off, I met this girl through a mutual friend, we did not hit it off....like at all. At each other‚Äôs throats, passive aggressiveness, and mutual hatred( many nights we would yell obscenities at another). After a couple of months of hatred we soon bonded over our mutual hatred of the friend that introduced us,(became a dickhole, accused her of stealing shit when it was impossible that she did that, and being a dickhole to me) so somehow we became really good friends. Me, her, and her friends, would go out and party together. And me being the only guy and relatively a bigger dude, I was their watch dog. (Had to piggy back one of her friends and having to hold her and another friend at my sides back to their dorms. I‚Äôm not the biggest drinker so I make sure they don‚Äôt do anything too stupid.) anyway, one night, I was blazed out of my mind, she drunk as a skunk, just got back from a party and and after lots of drunk/high flirting she kissed me. Now, I‚Äôve kissed my fair share of woman, but when we kissed well, it didn‚Äôt feel like a random kiss you have with a stranger at a club. It felt like a kiss you share with someone you really care about. It kinda made my mind explode with warm feelings of   companionship. After that we didn‚Äôt talk for a week because she thought she ruined our friendship. We never really spoke about the kiss, and we both ignore it, except for me. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. And it happened like 3 months ago. We agreed to hang again when college starts again but I really want to tell her how I feel. And not sure it‚Äôs worth ruining our friendship and all we have gone through. How would I go about expressing these roller coaster of emotions I feel for her? I really value her, and wouldn‚Äôt want to do anything that would compromise our friendship, but I can‚Äôt keep hiding these feelings.",2019-07-08 04:44:57,8,3,relationship_advice

But the hard part is I myself being a very joyous optimistic loud person having to handle and understand why my boyfriend is going through his mood swings when I thought we were having a good time. For example, he gets sad, a lot. I usually deal with it and comfort him but it just doesn‚Äôt seem to ever work, and it‚Äôs starting to get to me because I feel that there‚Äôs a better way to handle it then just being lame and saying ‚Äúeverything is alright‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here I love you‚Äù ya know?

Sometimes it gets even harder when I think we are enjoying our time together, when I‚Äôm having such a great time and smiling and feeling loved but he suddenly is sad. I ask what‚Äôs wrong he says ‚Äú I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm just sad‚Äù and tells me he has no particular reason it just hits him. I think at this point we both agreed he suffers from depression, and some days it gets really really bad.

I don‚Äôt want to enable the behavior of that but I also don‚Äôt want to push him around make him do stuff, make him have fun when it‚Äôs not really fun. If it isn‚Äôt fun for him it‚Äôs not fun for me, which causes the issues of it‚Äôs starting to affect me. I start to feel the gloom he radiates I start to sit and think of the what if‚Äôs. Like what if he‚Äôs sad because I‚Äôm not doing enough? Or I‚Äôm not enough? I start to think he‚Äôs unhappy because I really don‚Äôt do it for him. I feel as though he makes me happy and warm and fuzzy but he gets sad because something is missing. He reassures constantly that I make him feel things he‚Äôs never felt before, that he feels capable of anything. But, other days will say he feels numb and that he wants to do nothing. How do I handle it? How do I get him to at least not have the bad days for so long? It‚Äôs ok to be sad and have bad days, I‚Äôm ok with having a boyfriend who struggles with emotions. I‚Äôd never want to make him feel as though he‚Äôs not allowed or that he has to ‚Äúfix himself‚Äù or I‚Äôll leave. I just want to be able to do something for him to at least make numb feelings sting less and sad days be short in number, so that we can continue to have our good days. 
Oh and if you‚Äôre wondering, I‚Äôve already suggested therapy and or medications/doctor visits. Thats a whole can of worms he‚Äôs not ready for and is deathly panicked and scared of that journey. So that‚Äôs why I ask how to do baby steps of me handling and understanding first before we make big decisions so maybe once I get the hang of his emotions I can then find the right words of comfort to get him to that process of healing.",2019-07-08 04:40:36,6,8,relationship_advice
620,cagk6p,USD2018,"I'm the sensitive one in a family of assholes, any survival tips?","Growing up I've been the butt of many jokes in my family, over time it's basically become part of the dynamic in family reunions to make jokes at my expense. I've contributed to this by laughing at jokes about my ditzy moments, relationship history &amp; current single status, as well as just throwing out some of my own self depreciating humor. I like to have fun and not let hurt feelings take away from the humor of certain situations. 

HOWEVER, sometimes it's just not the right time. For instance, I'm currently processing emotions from a recent breakup, so jokes about it are hitting me harder than they would otherwise. Over the last week some of the jokes I found to be the most hurtful had to do with me working too much to find a man, having self esteem too low to find someone deserving of me, how I'm lucky to have a dog because a dog won't leave me like all the men in my life have, etc. Ughhhh!! I've been single for three months. The longest stretch of time I've been alone since high school. You'd think I'd catch a break being only 25, what is the rush? But when I raise these defensive arguments, I'm met with ""wow don't be so sensitive...it was just a joke"" and ""wow why are you STILL emotional about the breakup? What's wrong with you?""  Haha ummm yes I'm hurting, but it's a fairly natural mending process so I don't feel like I need to be ostricised for having feelings about it. 

After being on the receiving end of countless jokes from my sister all night about what type of mother I'll eventually be based on how I raise my dog (a pushover or a total control freak), I threw out a joke about her quality as a cat mom. We live together and she basically abandons her cats to go out of town for a week at a time. I'm the one doing most of the feeding, litter box changing, and giving affection... I'm not even a cat person. So I made a joke about how her kids will probably need to be vaccinated. 

Everyone laughed their asses off,  she took the joke super personally and walked out of the room. I said ""wow, I think she's guenuinely upset with me"" and my step dad jumped to her defense and said that I clearly took her jokes personally and lashed back in a manner that was below the belt.  That infuriated me to say the least because it's just hypocritical, but she's his favorite so there's no use bothering with it. I apologized to her so that everyone could continue to have a nice time during the vacation but I'm harboring resentment toward her and my dad over that interaction (as well as countless similar interactions). 

Does anyone relate? How can I still have a sense of humor about delicate topics without A) neglecting my hurt feelings when they occur and B) without seeming like I'm lashing out?",2019-07-08 04:38:06,6,4,relationship_advice
621,cagjf1,xtineyree,Sister(24) is dating a married man(~40s),"Need some advice.. I‚Äôve known for months now that my sister has been having relations with a married man (#2). She‚Äôd been hiding details about him from me until recently, when she took it upon herself to post a photo of her backpack with his name patches stuck to them. she also shared a photo of him wearing a wedding band, and in the background behind him was a photo of his wife. After looking him up, turns out the man had already been involved in an affair with another woman, less than a year after marrying his current wife. My sister has been openly posting about this man much more frequently. But after I questioned her about it, she‚Äôs blocked me from seeing anything she shares. 

This is the second time my sister has gotten involved with an older married man, and during her first bout, the wife angrily came after her and the husband called my sister a stalker, denying their relationship. She used to sneak married man #1 into my house while I was at work (and she‚Äôd let my dog out to potty) until I found out about her sneaky activities from a mutual friend. 

My sister doesn‚Äôt have a job, has over 10K in medical bills, and lives at home with our parents (I‚Äôm married and live somewhat nearby to my family).  it breaks my heart watching her lie to our parents every day, and I feel like my parents have given up trying to help her. They don‚Äôt care what my sister does anymore. I‚Äôm fairly certain she is going into debt due to her trips out of state to visit married man #2. 

After trying to talk to my sister about this situation, she has started avoiding me and our cousin. Our aunt (dad‚Äôs sister)  has been encouraging my sister to continue this relationship with married man #2 instead of telling her it‚Äôs not one of her best life choices. Definitely not a fan of how my aunt is teaching my sister to lie to my parents about these ‚Äúboyfriends‚Äù. it‚Äôs awful watching my sister be someone‚Äôs ‚Äúside piece‚Äù. I feel like my sister dreams that married man #2 will leave his wife for her, much like she thought the first time around with married man #1.  Nope. 

I‚Äôm not sure how to approach my sister , if at all, regarding this situation.. but I‚Äôm tired of her disrespecting everyone around her and thinking my cousin and I are ‚Äúsnitching‚Äù on her when we just care about her well being. She‚Äôs also started treating my husband like shit because of the one time she walked into MY house without any heads up and started asking about restraining orders (from married man #1 and his wife) and got pissed when my husband answered her question. If she wanted a private conversation she should‚Äôve asked me to step outside. Lately my sister has had this mentality of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm better than all of you, and I don‚Äôt need to tell anyone anything‚Äù. Ok. Well then, Dearest Sister, please don‚Äôt ask me to drive you to the emergency department anymore when you experience excruciating pain after sex cuz some dude‚Äôs sausage helped you rupture a massive ovarian cyst. 

I am worried that she will get an STD or get pregnant by married man #2 or the other men she keeps in her arsenal when #2 isn‚Äôt around. i know she‚Äôs an adult and can make her own decisions, but as her big sister I feel like I can‚Äôt just sit and wait til she gets in trouble.. 

Sorry if this post was a mess... I‚Äôm just venting and I don‚Äôt what to do (or if I should do anything)",2019-07-08 04:35:41,3,1,relationship_advice

623,cagja0,TITUS8585,Please help I'm do desperate at this point,"Hi guys, throwaway for privacy. 

So recently my girlfriend has been opening up a lot more. We've been dating about two months and she trusts me more than anyone else. I had already knew rhat she had a history of cutting and self hatred, and that she couldent define a ""reason for it."" She told me that her parents had considered divorce and that caused a lot of vulnerability to bad influences, which really took over. She dated a really bad influence that led her into a path of lying to her family and considering suicide. Eventually her parents found out and began HEAVILY restricting her. 

Recently, she opened up with me and had told me that she has been struggling with old tendencies again. She described a metaphor that she is in a cycle of going back to a house of torturous demons. This will be the third time she would go back, and I really worry that it might be self destructive. 

Unfortunately, I'm really only able to talk to her over snapchat becuase her parents are still very strict and wont have her dating until she is a year older (I'm a RS Junior and she is a Sophomore, both very mature). 

Now here's the thing, this isnt it. She has described often getting panic attacks that she doesnt understand, something I have never experienced, ever. She has also described being misophonic (an intolerance to certain noises, for her it is mostly chewing and swallowing, among some other outliers.) She has total mood swings and can't define why. 

I really don't know what to do here, not to sound selfish but I love her and I feel every ounce of pain she feels, how do I help pull her out of this trench?

624,cagiyb,Throwawaygfdui,Gf ignores drinking and driving,"Try to keep this short

Been with my gf for over 4 years, we‚Äôve had our ups and downs and recently she gave me an ultimatum about marriage.

She was at a flag football sports co ed tournament (watching).  She said she was only going to be there for 2 hours, then her mom would pick her up and they were going to a families place, she ended up being there for over 8 hours.

I was concerned she would get carried away drinking (she drove there in the late morning). She wasn‚Äôt very responsive to me after she texted me saying she was only going to be there for 2 hours. Until I heard back from her 5 hours later.

I pushed to see how she was doing, seeing if she was having fun with some of her friends that she doesn‚Äôt hang out with but sees very very rarely in passing. (I‚Äôve never really met them).

Sure enough she was getting agitated and said she‚Äôs doing fine and would call me after finals.

No call happened, I pushed again and she finally called me right when she was arriving at her home.

She was drove home, approx 15m drive by highway) I could tell she was slurring her words not be a lot but some.

She said she had 5 beers in an 8 hour period, she didn‚Äôt eat anything, said she was fine... she weighs fucking 130lbs soaking wet.. 5‚Äô5. I personally question whether she only had 5....

I‚Äôve tried to reason with her over the phone saying that she shouldn‚Äôt do that, she discounts it. I tried to follow up with texts and she just deflects ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have known if a friend didn‚Äôt text you‚Äù a friend messaged me asking if I was there because they saw my 
Gf.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt plan to stay there that long‚Äù

She keeps saying it‚Äôs fine, deflecting, saying a rare sorry and that it‚Äôs not a big deal.

It is a big fucking deal man... DUis are serious fucking business and this is so unacceptable I would have easily picked her up, if rolls were reversed she‚Äôd be so upset with me. She could hurt or kill someone. I‚Äôve had a friend die because of drinking and driving 

I take the high road lots of times in confrontations but I‚Äôm so distraught over this I can‚Äôt even think. 


History: couple years back we got into a very big fight previously and she drove to my place pissed drunk (wasn‚Äôt fighting but she let herself go because of stress and upsetness) and I couldn‚Äôt reason with her while she was like that and eventually the following day she realized how stupid it was and was very upset with herself genuinely...

The fact she didn‚Äôt get pulled over passing a police station and going from downtowns THAT time is fucking unreal.... she would have been all over the fucking road then.


While this is much less than that time it doesn‚Äôt make it any better, I often think she gets carried away with friends and it often ends up in arguments where we have underlining problems and when alcohol gets into her she lets her emotions take over.

But this is the second time for driving and I can‚Äôt deal with this. I don‚Äôt know how to reason with her. She‚Äôs generally very passionate and combative. She is very firey...

So reddit how do I address her and this problem? 

Because she‚Äôll view it as an out or a reason for me wanting to break up if I push very hard about how this genuinely upsets me... 

I‚Äôm so sad. And upset.

625,cagivs,jeffy1701,I [17M] want to be baptized and the pastor of my church wants my parents to perform it.,"**TL;DR: Am getting baptized in 1 month, pastor wants parents to perform it, but I'm uncomfortable with this because of my parents emotionally abusive behavior.**

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully the title isn't worded too confusingly. I signed up to be baptized at church next month and it was entirely my own decision. Beliefs aside, the pastor reached out to my parents asking they be the ones to dunk me in the water (because that's the way my church does it). My parents accepted the request and told me later that day.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't told anybody yet that I really don't like this idea. Not for religious reasons, but personal ones. Let me explain.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, my ""mom"" is actually my step-mom, who is my legal guardian. She came into my life when I was 9, but last year it finally clicked that she is emotionally abusive. My ""dad"" is my biological father, but he has this weird complex about me being an orphan because he wasn't in my life until I was 4 years old (my biological mom left my dad after I was born, and I was sent to be raised my my grandma until I moved in with my ""parents"" at 11). Turns out, he didn't want a kid in the first place, so that explains why he is rarely happy with me.

&amp;#x200B;

A year ago I decided I would no longer refer to them as real parents, and would leave both of them as soon as I turn 18.

&amp;#x200B;

626,cagipf,Throwawaybcoofoofoof,I (22F) don't know what to do about my long distance relationship with my boyfriend (23m),"So to preface this, we have been dating for 2 years. We live together in an apartment. He is awful at communicating anything thats not in person, I like to make these things short so I'll answer questions about specifics in the comments.

My boyfriend has a job where he travels constantly. They kind of misled him and told him it would be 3-4 days at a time when in reality it's anywhere from 1 month- 2 years at a time. He does get to come home every three weeks for 3 days if he chooses, but it does obviously reduce his hours. 


He has worked here for about a month or two. I am having a hard time dealing with the loneliness at our apartment. He doesn't like to video chat and usually goes to bed as soon as he gets back from work. We also have alternating hours so on days I work, Im at my job by the time he is off and vice versa. 

I now feel lucky to talk to him for 10 minutes a day, we go many days without even talking. He only messages me when I message first and has no interest in ""good morning texts"" or anything. Usually I wouldn't care about that petty stuff but when I found out he has a whole morning off, around 5 hours off, and doesn't want to talk to me I feel really rejected and unimportant.

I proposed and break and he was furious I even suggested it. I feel like I'm a lower priority than minecraft (which I like to play with him but he never tells me when he's online), so I feel beaten down and just lonely. Am I overreacting by wanting to set our relationship on pause while he's gone? 

TL;Dr: my boyfriend travels for work and never makes time to talk to me, should we go on a break?",2019-07-08 04:33:30,4,1,relationship_advice
627,cagidq,Justanotherthrowsd,"Me (33M) Girlfriend (31F), fucked up due to alcholosim, attending A.A. but the damage may be done.","Obvious Throwaway

This is all pretty Fresh

We have been seeing each other 8 Months, 5 Months dateing

Recently my Partner rang to break up with me after i had passed out the night before from drinking. (and i woke up to her gone from my house) I dident get angry etc i knew it was possibly coming, i fucked up. need to get a hold of my issues.

I got her to consider a extra chance. But im not sure if that was the right move, for me or her. most everything has been pretty good outside of my carelessness drinking, 3 total occasions with her, I made a promise to change once, not prompted by her but me realising it, and that was a lie to myself and by extension her at the time as i dident give up the booze or reduce it enough

She is going through a devorce which started over a 2 years ago, and she has a young daughter, works full time and studys part time. In our conversation she admited her baggage is affecting her decision.

So there is very little time for me in her life, the relationship started casual, but we over time worked out that we kinda were getting close and developing attachment, and decided to date than casual.

After the conversation about the future and she decided to agree to another chance, reluctently, and i did note a hint in her voice where she sounded very mousey and, not sure, weak, like she had been defeated. (i know her previous marriage the guy was abusive) Then came back and had conditions to which i accepted. Including one condition that mid august if she still decides to leave, i don't fight for it anymore i just let her go.

The reason mid august? had put alot of work into arrangeing her birthday Party at her parents holiday house, and inviting people she is freinds with that i am friends with so we could all go away and have a good time. She doesent get that chance often etc.

Although i have had a long held belief if you want somthing bad enough you will always fight for it, but i have concern especially after the meekness in her voice, i kinda felt like i was bullying her into it, that she really doesent want to continue but she dident want to argue about it so gave in to any option that gave her a out. 

She also expressed that she feels guilty she doesent have enough time for me alot, which makes her feel anxious about coming to see me for long periods when she could be spending it studying or spending on her free time more on herself. I already know this, but every time she decided to have ""her"" time, she wouldent really express it very well, i sort of had to work out via text what she really wanted. She was super reluctant to ""let me down"" so to speak or hurt me becasue she would rather do her own thing sometimes or somthing she needed to do. I expressed she needs to communicate it with me better, to a point where i basically did not see her for more than 4 hours in a 7 week period, it sucked, but shes important to me so. I had no problem what ever made her happy.

She is very introverted, but also very free, she met one of my friends GF's a few months back, and they fell in love with each other, both introverts etc. but i already sort of know both there personalitys and guessed they would hit it off.

&amp;#x200B;

So i think i have battled the bottle for a long time, but never really done anything for a long time about it. From friends and family (as obvoiusly with alchohol there are black spots) im never voilent, but i can get loud and obnoxius and have been known to pass out early if it's been a big day and then i decide to binge becasue it's a Friday/Saturday.

Either way im still a asshole because it's a deamon and i must deal with it. I have now started A.A.

When i start to drink, i don't really stop, untill i passout. I never vomit or anything, but i can get verbal direah, which aparently is the most annoying thing to deal with from me (and people get on edge with me about it).

I understand it's like taking care of another Adult when this happens, she's not my mother, and i don't want her to be. She already has to take care of her daughter,  and all her other responsibilities, why put up with me becasue when i drink i become another thing to take care of?

So theres the context to bad actions.

&amp;#x200B;

We have still had contact since, she used to say good night with the kiss heart emoji almost every night, and me the same. now obvoiusly it is without that, i dident ask her to continue doing that, but she has anyway, which at first gave me hope. I responded with the kiss after my goodnight but i feel i may be sending the wrong message. she sent her first good morning snap to me this morning (which had disapeared over the last few days), and we talked a little text wise, but nothing serious, i try to be light hearted ( i usually am) but everythings very facual, no real emotion, ie it's not working or shes not ready.

Does she just need space and i did not give it? Is she just biding her time till she can get out and save face? she can leave right now, i own nothing of hers, she can just ghost me if she really wants to. I wouldent blame her. 

I will note most of the friends for the party per se are originally mine, i have tried to involve her in this way as she doesent really have time for friendships per se. Most of the people she refers to as friends are acutually work mates or previous FWB's or FB's...

or has the relationship made her feel locked her out of freedoms she had in the little time she had and it's in the background a lurking issue, to which my selfish drinking actions simply brought it to the fore? Or in generally shes not feeling it anymore and has ""tried"" but this just made the breakup happen faster, and were only prolonging it the eventuall result.

Have i totally Disrespected her decision to end it when she admited theres hope, but very small and taking that hope?

or am i just taking being broken up with badly the wrong way?

Is staying in contact and being nice doing the wrong thing here? 

Is this saveable or are we both now wasting our time?

I don't want us to string each along for potential doomed relationship. but risk, reward.

I know she reads reddit, if she reads she will work out it's us and i could doom it further. IMO It's worth the risk, i haven't been in this situation before, not with these feelings, ide usually take my shame with me, or i had already broken up with them becasue it wasent right. but this girl is different, at least to me.",2019-07-08 04:32:21,1,1,relationship_advice
628,caghxp,riderofrohan34,Worried girlfriend would leave me if she found out I wasnt 100% straight.,"Hey everyone,

So I'm pretty upset right now and my situation is pretty complicated so let me explain.

I'm sexually and romantically attracted to women. I've never been attracted to guys romantically at all either. Its only when I get turned on I get sexual thoughts about guys and girls, but the sexual thoughts about guys go away and seem disgusting after I orgasm. I also watch gay and straight porn. Ive heard this is pretty common, I've heard that if after you orgasm and the gay thoughts are gone, you're straight. But I've also heard it is still a sign of bisexuality if you have the sexual thoughts about guys at all. This may get a bit graphic, but I have had fantasies of myself giving head and receiving anal sex from some ripped guy, but as soon as I orgasm, this goes away entirely. Zero attraction. Some try to say this is social conditioning making you lose attraction, but I feel zero guilt for my fantasies. I literally just lose attraction. I dont know if I'm bi or straight or in between. And honestly even if I was in a sexual situation with a guy, I dont honestly know if I would go through with it. Sometimes I think I would, sometimes I think I wouldnt.

I dont really mind but what worries me is my girlfriend. She is a conservative Christian and was raised learning that homosexuality and bisexuality and everything was wrong. She doesnt hate gay people and she has gay friends, but I know she would have a problem if she found out I had gay fantasies. Like I said, I never have them in my normal thoughts, they only appear when I'm horny. And I still jerk off to women too, but I fear she would leave me if she found out. I know she wouldnt find out unless I told her, but it scares me that I'm hiding something that she may leave me for. 

Maybe I'm a bitch but I've been tearing up typing this because I love this girl. I couldnt imagine life without her, but part of me feels inclined to tell. It scares me so much because I know she would be uncomfortable with it. Should I just keep it a secret? Any advice would mean a lot. Thanks.",2019-07-08 04:31:02,7,1,relationship_advice

I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend on Thursday and she said yes quite enthusiastically.

On Friday we went on a nice date to the movies then dinner and we ended up having sex that night.

Today (sunday) we were supposed to hangout because i leave for a couple weeks to go camping and during the day she told me that she probably couldn‚Äôt come because of some stuff going on at home. She was texting me all day from work and was supposed to get off at 10:30, she stopped texting me around 9 though (which was fine, she was at work). I went out with some friends and dropped by our work place to grab some food and say hey, and found out she had left at 9, so I got slightly worried and asked her if she had gone home and didn‚Äôt receive a reply. I ended up checking snap maps just to check if she got home safely and she was 30 minutes away from home in another town at someones house.

She ended up turning off snap maps around 11, and i really don‚Äôt know how to go about saying anything to her or bringing it up. I wouldn‚Äôt be upset about her going out with other people or anything but the secrecy and telling me there was family troubles and all has just given me a lot of anxiety in this situation.

632,cagfa1,SpaceCadet_024,It's been 5 years since my boyfriend from high school broke up with me (22F) and I still think about him even though I am currently in a relationship with someone else.,"I've never actually admitted this to anyone, but it has been years since my ex-boyfriend from high school has spoken to me- yet, I think about him a lot more than I'd like to admit. It's not even in a romantic way, most of the time, I just come up with these random scenarios in my head where we would somehow magically run into each other (even though that has never happened). He wasn't my first boyfriend, but he was my first serious boyfriend. He was a year younger than me, and when I graduated high school in 2014, by the grace of God, my mom let me go with his family to Greece for a whole month that summer. I thought I was going to marry him. When I started going to community college, things weren't the same obviously, he was still in high school. I could feel things shift between us, and I felt like I was clinging onto what was left of our relationship. We didn't see each other much anymore, I didn't even know if he was interested in me anymore, and this guy in my English class at the time started giving me attention. I didn't cheat on him or anything, the guy in my English class was just interested in me and I knew it. One day we were arguing, and I just blurted out about the guy in my English class and that just about did it. He ended up breaking up with me on our year and a half anniversary. After that, I have to admit I kind of did turn into a crazy ex-girlfriend, contacting him off a texting app disguised as a friend to see if he still had feelings for me. But one day, he just abruptly stopped making contact with me. I was devastated about how it was so easy for him to just drop me. We were each other's real first loves, and it didn't make sense how he was able to move on from me so fast. And he doesn't have any social media what-so-ever, so it wasn't like I could stalk him. This was the first time a guy didn't want me, usually I was the one to turn down someone- so I guess that was a wake up call to me too. Honestly, the details of what went wrong in our relationship are so hazy at this point, I can't remember much and I guess I just wanted to so badly forget about it all.

I think about him a lot, which concerns me even after I  have had multiple relationships since then. Looking back at our relationship, he was actually a horrible boyfriend to me. I would have never let the things he did to me slide now, but since I loved him so much then, I let him dictate and control my life. I just can't figure out why even after ALL this time, I still think about him. I am in a very healthy relationship with possibly the man I want to spend the rest of my life with, but why do I still think about an ex-lover that treated me horribly and doesn't even want anything to do with me??

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about him so much that about 2-3 years ago during the summer, I ended up contacting him via email to check in and see if we could have lunch or something. At least if I tried contacting him, no matter what the outcome, I can have peace of mind knowing the answer and never having to wonder about the ""what-ifs"" anymore. He ended up responding a couple days later, basically saying that he was fine and his family was fine, and to have a great summer. Ouch. It did hurt a little bit, but I ended up just deleting the email. 

&amp;#x200B;

A year later, coincidentally I saw him in the corner of a picture that someone else had posted, and he was in the background with his family and some girl (I'm assuming his current girlfriend) at our old high school's basketball game. It was really weird to see him, even if it was in the corner of some picture, and it's almost ingrained in my brain. I haven't seen him at all since he broke up with me five years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really have any explanation of why I still think about him besides maybe that he was my real first love and the first person I had ever traveled with, so I have some deep memories and experiences with him, but I have thought about him more times than I ever had with my other exes (the more recent ones). Is there anything I should do? Should I see a therapist or something?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My ex bf broke up with me 5 years ago, he doesn't have any social media, hasn't talked to me since, yet I still think about him ALL the time. pls help",2019-07-08 04:22:45,1,1,relationship_advice

634,cage30,Bunnyqqq,I accidentally saw some suspicious text preview on my boyfriend‚Äôs phone.,"This is my first time posting on reddit. Both my fiance and I are 30 this year and we have been in a stable, loving relationship for 6 years. 
This morning while I was transferring some holiday photos from my fianc√©‚Äôs phone to myself via WhatsApp. Someone sent a Whatsapp text and I accidentally saw the preview, ‚ÄúHey bby! I‚Äôm having fever...‚Äù the sender has a woman‚Äôs name. (Yes it‚Äôs spelt as ‚Äòbby‚Äô in the message, not sure if the sender was trying to type ‚Äòbaby‚Äô or what) I did not click into the message to view the full message.  I have no idea who this woman is. 
After I‚Äôm done transferring photos, I just told my fianc√© that he has some messages. He just view the message, not sure if he replied, and he deleted the message. 

Some background of myself. I am someone who doesn‚Äôt snoop around. I don‚Äôt check my fianc√©‚Äôs phone because I believe in privacy. So seeing that message preview is really by pure chance.   However, after seeing the text, I tried to snoop around a lil. I don‚Äôt see anything regarding the sender. She doesn‚Äôt exist in the call log or messages. My fiance has 2 phones, 1 issued by the company for work and 1 for personal use. The woman‚Äôs contact is in both work phone and personal phone. The message preview I saw was on work phone. He usually only uses workphone to contact his colleagues and me. 

I‚Äôm not very sure what to think of this. I would say for past 6 years we have been in v trusting and stable relationship. We have never had any argument over anyone else before and I would say we have always been open with our whereabouts, who we hang out with. So far both of us are chill about such things. I can feel that my fiance loves me a lot through his action and speech for the past 6 years. 

I‚Äôm sure eventually I will ask him about the message and continue to keep all communication opens as always. 

It would be very hard for me to imagine possibility of my fiance cheating because I think he‚Äôs happy in our relationships and we frequently spent time together every week. He always spend weekends with me and even my family. We also text regularly everyday throughout the day. I don‚Äôt even think he has the time to cheat. No suspicious or unusual behaviour from him other than the text preview I saw. We also just returned from a short, relaxing holiday yesterday. He frequently talks about our future together and he looks forward to owning a house together. He has even been looking through property listing and interior design for our future house quite frequently. 

I‚Äôm not sure the message was accidentally sent to him which was why it was deleted or what. Wanted to write this down somewhere and hear some advice before I ask him about the message.",2019-07-08 04:19:08,5,1,relationship_advice
635,cage24,Throwaway16339372,Have I been too forgiving/patient or am I being unreasonable?,"Hey Reddit. I‚Äôm a long time user and have posted to this subreddit a few times offering advice. Ironically enough, I‚Äôm the one looking for some unbiased advice now. I don‚Äôt really have anyone I can talk to about my relationship so here I am. Anyways, this may be a lengthy post but I‚Äôll try and keep it to the point.   

Recently something happened between by girlfriend and a recent friend (best friend of her best friend) that made me pretty upset and reminded me of past incidents. To give context I‚Äôll start by talking about those. We are both turning 23 this year and have been together for two years.  

My GF (let‚Äôs call her Sarah) and I started dating after getting to know each other for 3 months. I met her through my brothers friends and thought she was amazing, well spoken, mature, and pretty. It was incredibly easy to talk to her and I found myself falling for her hard. She‚Äôs without a doubt the kindest person I know and would do anything for my happiness.   

However, the first incident occurred a couple months after we had been dating I think. A guy at her work (a nice fancy restaurant and let‚Äôs call the guy Matt) was clearly into her but Sarah has an incredibly difficult time recognizing when guys want something more than just being friends. When her work friends went out together Matt wanted to go to the arcade but no one else wanted to other than Sarah so the two of them went. She ended up sitting on his lap while they played some arcade game. Needless to say I was pretty furious and thought it was pretty disrespectful. Sarah has always been physically open (holding hands, cuddling, hugging) with her friends, guys and girls alike. I thought common sense would make it pretty clear that these things should stop once you get into a relationship. Sarah didn‚Äôt seem to clue in to this.   

Second incident was with Matt again and happened after I had spoken with her about the first incident with him. They were at another work party and Matt apparently had his arm around her rubbing her shoulder and was holding her hand. She says she thought nothing of it and that he was just being friendly. I once again talked to her about how it made me feel and how outlandish it was to me that she couldn‚Äôt recognize a guys advances. I‚Äôm not sure how far apart incident 1 and 2 were but both happened within the first year we dated.   Since then she has been more vigilant with regards to guys making moves and nothing had happened until a couple of days ago. She was drinking with her best friend (Stacy), Stacy‚Äôs husband, and Stacy/her husband‚Äôs best friend who is a guy (James). Sarah is really close with Stacy and they cuddle and stuff all the time when they drink which is fine but when Stacy and James were sitting on the couch watching a movie she sat between them. James put his arm around Sarah and was rubbing her shoulder. Jokingly, Sarah grabbed Stacy‚Äôs butt and James thought it would be a good idea to grab my girlfriends butt too. I‚Äôm royally pissed about it and at him but my issue is that she put herself in a position where a guy could make an advance and when he put his arm around her she did nothing. She walked away when he grabbed her butt and talked to him afterwards saying that it wasn‚Äôt okay.   

So here‚Äôs where I need advice. She‚Äôs apologized profusely but constantly says she‚Äôs working on getting better at being more conservative in her physicality and more vigilant in recognizing advances from guys. She promised this during the first incident too but it‚Äôs been a year since then and something like this still happened. Am I being too forgiving of her? Am I being unrealistic or unreasonable for thinking that it shouldn‚Äôt be that damn hard to have some boundaries when you‚Äôre dating someone important to you? I‚Äôm happy she tells me about these incidents since she could have easily not but I‚Äôm still bothered and confused.   

TLDR: girlfriend has been clueless to 3 different advances made by guys over our 2 years of dating. I have spoken to her about it each time but am I being too forgiving? Definitely need to read whole post for context.",2019-07-08 04:19:02,4,2,relationship_advice
636,cagdvw,_JackHammer_,Need someone to help talk me through this situation and my feelings,"So, I am 21, and have known my now wife for 6 years. I'm in the military, hence marrying kinda early (For me anyways) .

Anyways, I knew that marrying her was the right decision, she filled all my emotional gaps in my heart and after 6 years I knew it was time.

We married right as i left for basic. Over basic and my technical training I was gone for 8 months. It was hard, not going to lie, especially for a newly married couple, but we made I though it. 

It kinda all changed after I got home. She started to become very attached to me, I mean like....REALLY attached. To the point where if i even left the house to hang out with my buds or whatever she would emotionally break down and blow up my phone to the point where I would have to block her while I was out so I didnt drain my battery (this didn't happen before the military). She has started to hate everything that takes my attention away from her, and has spread to my family. She didnt even like me spending time with them, and would make me choose between them and her A TON. 
(Also, I MAYBE left the house to do things like this two or three times a month)

Gradually got worse, until I had to leave base a few times and call the cops becuase she threatened to kill herself (and I have firearms in the house), and iv also had to call them while I'm off work becuase a couple of times she has hit/bruised and scratched me as well as try to destroy my gaming systems and such.

That was all about 3 or 4 months ago, and I'm happy to say we saw counselors and therapists and worked through it, perfect timing too becuase we figured out she is pregnant! She is a lot better and our communication is great.....but this is the part I need help with....

I'm really happy everything is good between us, and that we got over that ""hump"", but becuase of the physical stuff she did to me and my things......I can't get those same feelings back I used to have.

I will 100% be there for her and my child, will never let that go if I can help it.......but I just feel like my heart isnt in it anymore, like I dont want to ""put it all out there"" again and become vulnerable. And becuase of that I'm just so numb towards her. I'm so excited for this baby (you have no idea, I'm gonna be ""Super Dad"") but it's just so hard when my heart feels this way. Any words of wisdom?

637,cagdus,yungluv2019,"Tried to DTR, got curved","So I (F 23) did it.
Tried to talk to my FWB/whatever the fuck he is (M 22) about possibly defining the relationship or even just discussing it after several months of us hanging out and acting somewhat like a couple (all of it really, just no titles).
Unfortunately for me, after all of the stress it was causing me to try and get my words out, he ended up shutting it down, said he doesn't want to discuss that. And that was it

I hate this. I am shook about it honestly, because the whole point was for me to get some clarity from him but, after all this time and a weird set of mixed signals, not only did he not want to discuss any part of it with me, but he didn't give any possible indication that he cares about me in any capacity (which really, that is the truth of what I wanted to know).

I don't know what to do now, that feels like cheating the game by not letting me say what I wanted to say. Relationship limbo, if you will. Not sure if I'm asking for advice or just ranting; I wonder if he will give any inkling of a shit when he realizes he probably lost me for good either way (probably not, but a girl can dream).",2019-07-08 04:18:23,4,1,relationship_advice
638,cagd04,chunkybadboy,Should I (18F) continue to give my father (50M) all the income I earn?,"Hi there!

This is my first time posting so I apologize for any mistakes made(english is my second language). I‚Äôm currently a university student and just started my first job a few weeks ago. I‚Äôve never been allowed to work a job because my father is very strict and he never allowed me to.Anyways it‚Äôs been quite hard for me because I have bad joints and I‚Äôm just to use to it. So after 8 hours of standing all day my feet are swollen, my knees kill me and I‚Äôm covered in blisters. But I‚Äôve been happy doing that in order to pay for a hair appointment (around 300 dollars). I know it sounds ridiculous but I‚Äôve never been allowed to dye my hair and I finally convinced my dad to let me.

 In my job I was paid for the the first time last week and I talked to my father, who knew about me wanting to dye my hair for months. I constantly annoyed about it and showed him pictures of what i wanted and got his approval. He said it was fine that I spent my money on that. I have a very close relationship with him, he‚Äôs a single father and I‚Äôm his only child and I appreciate all his hard work and love. 

Earlier this week he told me he needed around 200 for rent money. Which I sent to him without an issue. We‚Äôre currently having extreme financial issues so I know it‚Äôs my job to help out because I live at home and I‚Äôm his only child( he remarried but she lives in a different and he occasionally supports her because her situation is worse). 
Just today I confirmed with him that I have my appointment this week to make sure everything was ok with him. He told me he needed the rest of my pay check to pay for some bills( I‚Äôm not exactly sure he handles all the finances). Honestly I was a bit upset and I started crying( I can be very emotionally because of past issues). 

I‚Äôve really been looking forward to dying my hair for weeks. I hate my job especially since I‚Äôm working full time this summer. I told him how I was upset and we got in to a heated argument which I feel really bad about. I just wanted to do something nice for myself because I don‚Äôt know when my next day off is and I need to book an appointment weeks in advance. 

Anyways i ended up transferring him the rest of my paycheck and cancelling my appointment. Now he‚Äôs mad at me for making a big deal about it and he‚Äôs refusing to accept the transfer. But I just don‚Äôt know what to do, I don‚Äôt want to continue to not be in control of any money I earn. I know that I have to help out as much as possible but after working hard I‚Äôd like to have just one thing for myself. Any advice given would be greatly appreciated! I‚Äôm also really sorry about how badly written this is.",2019-07-08 04:15:49,10,3,relationship_advice

641,cagcmx,throwaway-getout,My (30/M) ex-gf (25/F) has come back into my life and is suicidal,"TLDR - my ex has been very unstable since the time I dated her, and knew her over 1.5-2 years. I knew she wasn't mentally stable (though no confirmed diagnosis, just I noticed her behavior) and used her for sex. Now she has a confirmed diagnosis, threatening to kill herself, and I feel trapped between a rock and a hard place.

&amp;#x200B;

My ex (dated about 4 months in 2018) came back into my life about 1.5 months ago. We'll call this ex Laura. We broke up originally as Laura cheated on me with her ex, got back together with him, came back to me after 1.5 weeks, I tried to make it work but her behavior told me she was going to do the same thing so I cut things off cold, no goodbyes, just walked away and blocked her number, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Laura's tried coming back into my life 3 times. Aug 2018, I shut her down and told her to leave me alone (she dialed \*86, was ignoring screened calls prior but thought she had given up by June 2018). Told her I was dating someone (which I was). 

&amp;#x200B;

Dating my other gf (we split up in Dec 2018), Nov Laura tried to reach out to me continuously. Promising sex, loyalty, open phone policy, leaving the location tracker on, etc. I ignored it, told her I was in a relationship, please leave me be. 

&amp;#x200B;

My other GF and I broke up due to distance, I had moved about 2 hours away for a job in late Sep 2018. Just wasn't working for her or me, I respected her a lot. Wish I could be dating her but she moved on and is dating someone else as of today.

&amp;#x200B;

After I broke up with my gf, I hit Laura up to see if she wanted to get together. I figured, clean the pipes, help me get over my ex, move on, nothing serious. As I was coming around to this, Laura ended up getting back together with the ex she cheated with me on, no joke. Like 2 days after we firmed up plans, I saw she was tagged on dates with the dude.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to Spring 2019, Laura reaches out. Broke things off 100% with the ex, he went into AA, was abusive, emotionally and mentally. All that stuff. Laura was very forward about sex, using that to manipulate me into seeing her, doing anything, saying anything, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ignore it for a while, finally break down and go see her. We have sex at her place, was fun as we do have chemistry in that way. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now at this point. I'll be honest I knew she had some mental issue based on her behavior. Very clingy, impulsive, changes her opinion on the turn of a dime, just all over the place.

&amp;#x200B;

So after we hook up for about 2-3 weeks, I end up getting distant as she's talking moving in together, serious stuff like that. Babies, marriage, etc. I get distant, stop taking her calls, slow things down. After about 1 week of this she hits me up and says she doesn't want to date and I'm free to see other people. I tell her we weren't committed to that isn't a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Mind you, Laura has lost both her parents in the span of 3 years to cancer. Her older brother isn't close to her, he abused her growing up. She never got the help needed. He does come off as controlling/off as well from what I've heard.

&amp;#x200B;

So fast forward a few weeks. We keep in light contact, don't see each other. It's the 2nd to last week of June. She calls me up telling me she's thinking of killing herself, she's extremely depressed, has nothing going for her, etc. I calm her down by telling her she does, she has a great group of friends that care about her. I'm here as a friend, want the best for her. 

&amp;#x200B;

She gets distant, doesn't follow up for a few days. Finally Thursday/Friday (last week of June) she starts pinging me. Friday she tells me she's been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. Tells me she is taking medication to help, going to therapy. I tell her how happy I am she is doing that. Try to be supportive.

&amp;#x200B;

Literally within that conversation her mood shifted and we went from having a very close convo to her demonizing me, acting like I'm trying to get her, all this stuff. Makes me feel like I'm crazy as I sat through an episode.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point. I feel a bit guilty, like I knew there wasn't something mentally right about this girl and I took advantage of that to have some freaky sex. Now since she's told me her diagnosis I haven't not had or proposed sex with her. I've been attempting to be a supportive friend, that's it. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm finding the lines get blurred depending on her mood, and she's reaching out to me often saying she's depressed and wants to kill herself.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not the girl I want to be with, the same time I feel terrible cutting someone off that's going through something like this when in reality they need a supportive group of people around them. Maybe I can't be in that group since she see's me (at times depending on her mental state) as husband material.

&amp;#x200B;

But I don't know what to do, I feel like if I cut things off completely; it's only going to make her condition worse (having someone she cares about abandon her). But I think if I continue this it's going to impact my mental state and be a burden to growing myself.

&amp;#x200B;

To note, I used to deal with depression badly and worked my way out of it. My fear is this will pull me back into that or at least be mentally taxing and impact my qualify of life.",2019-07-08 04:14:37,12,3,relationship_advice
642,cagcm1,sylphies,"Close friend keeps fantasizing/romanticizing my relationship with my BF, is this normal?","TL;DR: close friend keeps fantasizing about my relationship with my BF, goes on about how ""perfect"" he thinks we are for each other, and would imagine our reactions in imaginary scenarios he made up in his head. My BF and I have mentioned how off-putting it is for us multiple times, but it doesn't seem like the friend is really registering it.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background: My boyfriend, close friend (let's call him Kevin) and I are all in college and in our early 20s. I've been living in the same apartment with my BF for around 4 months, and Kevin has recently moved into the same apartment (we live in a 4BR) with us as well. The three of us have been pretty good friends for about half a year or so. Kevin is a really nice guy who both me and my BF really care for and appreciate the companionship of. Kevin himself has been through a few breakups (and was especially hung over his most recent one) and has, more than once, expressed that his life dream is to marry and settle down with the love of his life. As a result of his multiple failed relationships, Kevin is weirdly both obsessed with, and disillusioned by, the concept of love. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my BF and I became close friends with Kevin as we were helping him get through his most recent relationship (which was kinda toxic and was already in shambles by the time he reached out to us for help -- his ex broke up with him a short while after). At the time, my BF and I were trying to cheer Kevin up so we'd invite him to hang out more often, and would even let him crash on our couch (Kevin lived in a studio apartment at the time and was lonely at night). We were trying to offer emotional comfort and companionship for Kevin because he told us that he doesn't really have any close friends he can be fully comfortable with. As time went on, my BF and I hung out with Kevin more often, and would try to include him in things that we did. When Kevin hangs out with us, it's usually just my BF and I, so Kevin would often end up being the third wheel. This apparently doesn't bother Kevin at all, and instead makes him very happy(?) 

&amp;#x200B;

There have been multiple occasions wherein Kevin would eagerly tell us, and sometimes even our mutual friends, how glad he is to be able to be ""the official third wheel"" in our relationship and how amazing it is to see my BF and I act all ""lovey-dovey"" (basically head-patting &amp; hugging each other) together. He'll say things like ""aww you two are sooo cute together"" and ""please stay together forever!!!"" (in a very desperate tone as though he'd cry himself to sleep for a year if we ever broke up). He'd sometimes say that we're like his mom and dad (no, not like HIS mom &amp; dad, but just like a mother &amp; father figure). It's gotten to the point where he would tell us about how he likes to ""fantasize"" about our relationship, basically imagining things such as, and not limited to: 

\- What my BF and I's daily routine is

\- How perfect our love life is

\- How my BF and I will react to imaginary situations/scenarios

\- What it would be like for my BF and I to get married &amp; have children 

Keep in mind that he has actually mentioned, and would sometimes lead in-depth conversations, about these topics to both my BF and I. And from what I've gathered, it seems that he's also mentioned us in conversations with our mutual friends, and sometimes even to his own friends whom we aren't even acquainted with. We've brought up how bizarre we found his idealizations to be, and how uncomfortable it is for us to hear that, but it doesn't seem like he's going to stop fantasizing about our relationship any time soon.

&amp;#x200B;

So, reddit, is this behavior normal? I know that he's trying to vicariously live his dream of having a ""perfect"" romance through us, and even Kevin himself admitted that it's what he feels as well. What can we do/say to Kevin at this point?",2019-07-08 04:14:34,4,2,relationship_advice
643,cagcko,00Kaity_Kat00,"I don‚Äôt know if this situation is toxic or not, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Please help","   I came here because I‚Äôm really confused about how my current relationship is. 
   Little background, I‚Äôm 16 and I‚Äôm in a long distance relationship atm. Most of the times, my girlfriend is very nice to me. In fact, nearly all the time. And when she‚Äôs not, she‚Äôs but even really mean. Let me elaborate. 
   She can be very clingy, I‚Äôm not an insanely clingy person myself (I‚Äôm an only child without very many friends so I‚Äôm used to a good amount of alone time) but usually it doesn‚Äôt bother me. But I do need to have time to myself. If I‚Äôm in any social situation too long or too often I tend to get very burned out and go almost into a depressed like state. I don‚Äôt eat or shower or really leave my bed, I just kinda try to block out as much sensory input as possible (as I have issues with sensory processing as well). But when I say to my girlfriend ‚Äúhey I love you but I‚Äôm feeling worn down and need the rest of the day to recharge‚Äù she always responds with ‚Äúokay I‚Äôll sit here and mope‚Äù or ‚Äúno don‚Äôt go, talk to me instead‚Äù or something along the lines of her saying she‚Äôs clearly not good enough for me. 
   Now I‚Äôve explained to her time and time again that it‚Äôs not because I don‚Äôt like talking to her, I‚Äôm just trying to prevent myself from getting into a very unhealthy state. To that she replies by telling me she is a bad person and that I should just leave her and I end up having to comfort her.
   She also was recently in a car accident and insisted on talking about it with me even though I told her that it‚Äôs a very bad trigger of mine and she nearly sent me into a panic attack. She was then angry at me for ‚Äúnot being concerned about her‚Äù because I was so focused on not being swallowed in my own trauma that I was not thinking clearly enough to ask any questions.

644,cagbpj,ironmanfryingpan,Ive been in love with my close friend for a while now and I‚Äôm going to tell her but there‚Äôs a catch,"Sorry in advance for the long read.


I‚Äôve know known her since freshman year of high school (4 years ago) and we still talk to this day. I started liking her a couple weeks after meeting her and my feelings have just been getting stronger ever since. To the day I die, I will regret not having the balls to tell her how I felt about her back then. 

She‚Äôs perfect in my eyes in every way. I fell in love with her attitude, how chill she is, how open she is, how helpful and strong she is. I never want our conversations to end and just looking at her puts butterflies in my stomach and my heart beat faster. I‚Äôve never met anyone like her. I‚Äôd give up the world and then some just for her. But I don‚Äôt think she feels the same way towards me. 

She had her eyes set on this one guy in my school known for just fucking and moving on but nothing came of it. Finding this out hit me like a truck but I stuck by her side because I thought being her friend at the very least is good enough for me. 

She left my school halfway through sophomore year and it devastated me. I couldn‚Äôt even tell her how I felt on her last day at the school. All I could do was give her a necklace I bought the day before for her and hug her goodbye. I started talking to her best friend at the time only because I thought i lost the love of my life. I started going out with her best friend shortly after and things were going smooth, until the close friend texted me out of no where and asked if I wanted to go to her birthday party. I said yes immediately and went and had the time of my life. The dress she wore had me breathless. I remember that day like it was yesterday. A couple of her friends were there but I only focused on her. 

After the party, her best friend was mad at me that she wasn‚Äôt invited and that I went. She‚Äôd hold that against me and start talking shit about the girl I really loved up until I ended things at the beginning of senior year. 

This was also around the time I found out that my close friend had gotten a boyfriend. That news hurt me more than any other news I‚Äôve received in a couple years. But since I was single again and could hang out with her now without any repercussion, I hit her up and asked if she wanted to hang out some time (I grew balls in those couple years without her in my life). 

She told me about one of our friends birthday party and that I could go to it and how she‚Äôll be there so I decided to go. At the party, since this was the first time I‚Äôve seen her in 2 years, seeing her had me frozen. I could only think about my feelings towards her and how they were one sided. 

I needed to get my mind off it so I started talking to one of the girls I met at the party. My close friend was actually trying to push us together and I didn‚Äôt know how to feel about that. The girl I started talking to got a lot of my attention that day and 2 weeks later, I asked her out. We started dating but then she changed. The problems that comes up with any relationship would be handled very poorly by her. She would be really disrespectful towards me and threaten to leave me if I don‚Äôt change the way I do things. I ended things a day before our 2 month anniversary. One thing I liked about going out with her though is that I got to see my close friend a lot more as long as she was there with me.

It‚Äôs been 3 weeks since all that has happened and I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can go with feeling this way. I don‚Äôt want to wait for my close friend to get out of her relationship because who knows when that‚Äôll happen and I don‚Äôt want waste my time but then I see her and forget everything I just said. 

From what I‚Äôve seen, my close friend and her boyfriend fight a lot but seem to make up fast which could either be a good or bad thing. I also found out from my close friend that the boyfriend gets mad whenever she hangs out with me or anyone of her dude friends despite her knowing them longer than she‚Äôs known him. ahe has to ask him if she can hang out with my and her 2 other guy friends or else the boyfriend will get mad. It‚Äôs clear as day how insecure the guy is. She can‚Äôt even hug her friends hello or goodbye or that would be another fight in the relationship. Obviously you can‚Äôt do certain things while in a relationship but she can‚Äôt do a lot of things I think she should be able to do. She basically has to give up seeing us as much as she wants to for the boyfriend to be happy. I honestly don‚Äôt think they should be together, even if a part of me is just saying that because I want to be with her. 

To try to get over her is way easier said than done as whenever we‚Äôre together, she is very touchy and sometimes our conversations suggest she‚Äôs flirting but I don‚Äôt know and I doubt it. She is loyal after all. And I can‚Äôt help but be reminded of her relationship every time I think about me being in one with her since I‚Äôve seen her and her boyfriend doing things couples do normally but it just messes with me. 

Something happened recently though. A couple days ago my friend walked in on my close friend and her boyfriend and as soon as he entered, the boyfriend got off from his knees. The next day, my close friend tells my friend that her boyfriend proposed to her and she showed him the ring. He‚Äôs not sure weather she was joking or not. 

I was speechless hearing this. We‚Äôre both 18 so getting married right now is crazy to me. They have been going out for maybe a year and a half but I don‚Äôt thinks that‚Äôs enough time to propose to someone. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do with my feelings. No one should have to hide their feelings but I‚Äôm afraid if I tell her I‚Äôm getting nothing in return and possibly losing her. That would be a nightmare to me because being her friend at the very least is good enough for me.

But I‚Äôve decided, after I got some really good advice from my last post (which is very similar to this but not the same), that I‚Äôm going to tell her how I feel no matter what happens after. i have the balls for it now. I just don‚Äôt know when I should do it and what exactly I should say to her. From what I‚Äôve seen, their relationship can‚Äôt be long term but then again I‚Äôm not the one in it so it‚Äôs uncertain. Nonetheless I think I should let my feelings be know sooner than later.

Here‚Äôs what I have planned so far: in the next couple times I see her, maybe 3 times from today, I will show her our first conversations which is funny and cringy. Then I‚Äôll ask her, based on how we texted, if she liked me back then or am I delusional. Whatever her response is, I‚Äôll just get lost in her eyes on purpose then ask if I can talk to her privately. There I‚Äôll tell her everything. What I think of her basically toxic relationship, some of the stuff I told ya about and whatever comes from my heart at the moment. I wanted to also tell her ‚Äúi don‚Äôt remotely think you feel the same way I do towards me but that‚Äôs ok. I just really needed to get all that off my chest or else I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do‚Äù. After that, I‚Äôll go home right after. I was lastly going to tell her ‚ÄúI understand if you don‚Äôt want to talk to me after today. Just know Ive treasured every second I got to spend with you.‚Äù But I don‚Äôt like the vibe that comes with that so I won‚Äôt. Instead I‚Äôll just say ‚Äútake care‚Äù or something like that.

The chances of us still being friends after saying all this is hazy (If she takes the news like an adult) but there is another way. I could simply take some time to my self and not see her so often and HOPE she notices or cares. If she does, I‚Äôd tell her everything right then and there and that I need the space away from her to think about everything. This approach might be safer but might have the same result as the first. And it‚Äôs all based on if she notices or cares that we haven‚Äôt talked. 

At the end of the day, telling her how I feel while she‚Äôs in a relationship is really dumb and is more likely to have her mad at me and then cut me off completely than her say she feels the same way somehow... but I don‚Äôt care. As long as she knows how I feel about her and I get this weight off my chest, I‚Äôll be happy. Whatever happens, happens. Who knows, there‚Äôs a chance we can still be friends after or more after I told her everything. Now that would be a dream come true.

645,cagb8m,wolvesalice,my mom (a previous opioid abuser) may be relapsing and I don't know how to handle it,"sorry if this isn't appropriate, I just don't know what to do. tl;dr at the bottom.

 for some context, I'm a teenager who's been dealing with my mothers addiction for many years. I remember hiding her pill wrappers/bottles as a kid without her asking, knowing it's what she would do from observing. In recent years my grandparents (firm believers in mother/daughter relationships) have become very strict with her abuse. They lock up her medication to prevent her from abusing them, and we have since moved in with my moms new boyfriend (who I've only known for a few months.) She's acted fine for over half a year now, never showing any signs of being under the influence up until a few days ago. 

Today he called me to tell me where her medication is so I could grab it and give it to her. I've never had to do this before, and his location was very vague. I went into their bedroom to look and as I turned around I saw my moms phone propped up against the laundry basket. I'm not the brightest, so I grabbed it thinking she forgot it and placed it on the counter where she'd been cooking, only to see it had been recording for over ten minutes (about the time I'd been in the room looking.) she turned around and I, without thinking, said ""it was recording for some reason,"" as soon as the words left my mouth I realized what had happened and retreated into my room. i'm debating on whether or not to telling her boyfriend about it or call my grandparents.

After that day, my best friend didn‚Äôt want her around and I guess got a little jealous. I tried not to hang out with the other girl but I was only trying to be nice. Long story short, my best friend and I started becoming more and more distant as the year went on. We literally walked right passed each other like strangers. And btw, we were basically sisters. We were always together since 7th grade. Told each other EVERYTHING. Never judging one another just a pure friendship. One day, I saw her holding hands with another girl and found out she was a lesbian. I never cared if she was gay or not. She was my best friend and wish she would have told me and talked to be about it. Anyways, ever since then I would always try to talk to her, hang out with her, just make every effort I could to just go back to our friendship. It‚Äôs been 7 years since sophomore year.

647,cag824,badderfish0,My(16M) Mom (40M) is depressed/extremely stressed and also might be having suicidal thoughts,"Context: My mom ever since grandma's death has been a bit tuned off. My paternal family as well as my maternal family (except grandma) are assholes to mom, the only support she's ever had is either my grandma or my dad. My dad is residing in another country for a few months and therefore, it's only my mom, my 7 year old sister and me who are currently living in our main residence.

I took an holiday off from school and went to shower, while I came out of the shower I heard my mom crying and sobbing to one of her friends about how she has a major loss of 20K$ due to her trading and stocks (mom likes to take part in the stock market a lot and has a lot of shares). This along with the stuff she's told me in the past about how she's gotten an abortion when I was a toddler because of financial conditions and family problems when I was younger and my sister wasn't born yet. We are somewhat in a better condition financially and this is the reason even my family has been good to her. On top of that, my sister and me, have been A HUGE PAIN IN THE ASS, with us spending money on our stuff left and right, being rude towards mom and regular teenage/parent stuff, which has made mom's stressed more. All this stress has also caused a few mom a few health problems such as very low haemoglobin. Our family friends and people who live in locality are close with Mom and whenever she's with them, she's 100%, that I'm sure of. But even that's going to change since we're moving to where my dad is currently residing and this again is a major stress gainer.

These are the only a few reasons I can think of on the top of my one about why my mom might be depressed. The suicide part, I really don't know since I heard her say suicide a couple of times, qbut I'm scared it is possible. I really love my mom a lot and I can't lose her, I don't want my sister to grow without a mom.

648,cag7ki,kc9800,How do I trust him?,"Me and my boyfriend have been dating for 4 years and we live together. He struggles with mental illness (depression) and has broken up with me three times.

He just told me on the weekend that a year ago when he broke up with me for three days his ex went to his house and tried to sleep with him. He assured me he asked her to leave and nothing happened but for some reason I am still very bothered by this. I am looking for suggestions to try and better our relationship and gain trust.

I feel like some of it is that I just do not trust her because when we first started dating she told me they would get back together no matter what and are meant to be and has tried to get with him lots.

649,cag76m,dontwannausemymain1,[22M] Virgin but not in a rush/settle,"I'm 22 and haven't done most of the relationship stuff that should have probably happened by now. I'm pretty conventionally attractive and about 5' 11""/6' just to give a frame of reference. I go to a top 10 college. The thing is I've hadn't felt the pressure to go chasing after girls since middle school/early high school. My libido is high though. Once I went from like 5' 2"" to a little shorter than my current height between freshman and sophomore year, I stopped feeling so insecure about that stuff and decided to wait for when I found someone special. I know that sounds pretty silly for the current age. I did grow up Muslim (in Northeast America), but I don't believe in it anymore and my parents are fairly liberal when it comes to it. Not sure how much this plays into my ideals.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I do still get some shit from friends about me being a virgin, but it usually comes from a good place and I think they're just worried because I know most people have lost it by my age. Some people did ask me if I was gay in high school because I had a few girls try to get with me and I turned them down, but I am straight. I've had quite a few women approach me/ have crushes on me that I was aware of, but I just didn't think we would be good matches. I don't think I'm particularly interested in casual sex, and I could probably try harder to find someone I connect with.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend group teases each other a lot but sometimes it does get on my nerves when they rag on me about my virginity.  We all give each other shit and it's in good fun but when I'm having a shit day, sometimes I'm just really tired of it. Truthfully, I do get embarrassed by this sometimes especially if I'm going through some shit.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm asking advice on is if I should just go and hook up with someone to get it over with, and then continuing just being social until I find someone I really like? I'm usually a I'll try anything once kind of guy, but I'm a bit worried I'll regret losing it to some stranger or friend who might want something more. Alternatively, should I ease up my standards a bit so I have a better chance of connecting with someone even if I think it's unlikely at the beginning?",2019-07-08 03:58:36,8,1,relationship_advice

653,cag5w7,IBrokeMyHeadphones,I [M21] feel that my dad's [M50] attitude to 'keeping the peace' with the family is creating a divide between us that I want to resolve. How do I best approach this with him before it festers any more?,"Now, I will say that my dad is a good person, and I understand why he doesn't want conflict in the family. It's just gotten to a point where certain family members are acting in ways that I cannot let slide, and my dad is trying to sweep it under the rug in an attempt to, as the title suggests, keep the family peace.

For example, my grandad (his dad) is a horrible man for a multitude of reasons. I attribute my stress eating as a direct result of him mocking me for how much I eat for years when I was younger. This isn't the most egregious thing either, as he has constantly derided my brother for being a bad grandson to such a point that my brother refuses to have anything to do with him. Another incident involved him making my sister clean up his faeces on Christmas Day by way of making her drive down to his to do it while he sat eating his Christmas dinner. He's more than capable of doing this himself.

My dad is aware of these actions, yet doesn't say anything to him, because he believes my grandad won't change and that there's no point.

I'm sympathetic to my dad. I honestly am. He lost his mother in a tragic way before I was born and you can tell that he is really clinging onto the relationship with his father because he's the only parent he's got left. He doesn't want to cause friction because he's scared of losing more of his family.

But holding onto this relationship that so many of his other family see as warped is slowly degrading our own relationships with him. There are point where I resent my dad because of this, and I really don't want it to be that way. He has been the best dad I could ask for and I just want our relationship to stay strong.

A recent event with my grandad was when he met my girlfriend for the first time, and he immediately made fun of her glasses, which genuinely hurt her. I told my dad this, saying something to the effect of that I can somewhat take it if he's insulting me or someone else, but that I'm drawing the line at him insulting my girlfriend and that I wanted him (my dad) to at least tell him (grandad) that he was wrong in doing so.

I know he hasn't.

Is there a way that I can talk to him about this in such a way where he doesn't feel threatened about his relationships with his family?

I'm sorry for the utter ramble, but it really got to me tonight and I started to tear up typing this out. I would just really like some advice.

tl;dr: Me and other family members have a very strained relationship with my grandad, and my dad is trying to sweep all of it under the rug so that the peace is kept in the family. How do I talk about this to my dad, so that our relationship doesn't begin to fall apart as a result?",2019-07-08 03:54:48,0,3,relationship_advice

I've been dating a girl for a little over two years now. I love spending time with her and we both have common interests. I probably even love her lol. 

So the thing is I'm Indian-American. I moved to Mumbai a couple years ago but my family still stayed in touch with our group of family friends in New Jersey. This summer we went back and stayed at their houses, hung out, etc. One day, we went to my parents' friends place. I kinda know the kids; not too well though. But then I met their daughter. She's my age (rising HS senior) and it was love at first sight. I've never felt this way with any other girl. We only went there for lunch and, idek, the feelings I experienced were so powerful. I kept thinking about her for the next week or so that I was there until we left. 

Before I even met this girl, I was already thinking about the future of my current relationship. I mean I'm going off to college (girlfriend's a year younger) and I want to meet new people. A long distance relationship is too emotionally draining across several timezones. Meeting this girl in the US has done nothing to assuage my dilemma.

660,cag0wo,amm0045,Is my friend just a booty call?,"My friend has been dating a man over the last 3 months who lives in Charleston and she is in Chicago. He is mid thirties and divorced with two kids. She has gone down there 5 times and he has come to her once. Every time she leaves he says he can‚Äôt do it anymore and that it‚Äôs too much. The last weekend she was visiting they had a great time and when she leaves he says it‚Äôs over. They had sense worked it out and she was supposed to go back for the 4th of July (her 6th trip). I thought she should cancel. She waited till the end and then he told her they were broken up and to cancel. She went anyway (said she couldn‚Äôt get her money back) and told him she would just rent a car a drive elsewhere but somehow she ended up staying the night she arrived and the night before he left. He told her he still had feelings for her but wanted space until September. Is this guy just not into her? She keeps making excuses for him/rationalizing all of it. (Example: he‚Äôs divorced, he has kids, he has financial issues, I know he has feelings for me) 
Maybe I‚Äôm wrong but my boyfriend and I dated long distance and the first three months were the easiest part bc we wanted to be together all of the time. I have never heard of taking a two month break this soon. 
What do you think this guys deal is? 

(I wish I could share their texts: example of one was when she left this past time after he dropped her at the airport she sent a long text saying: confirming that we are broken up and taking a break, I want to know I‚Äôll see you in September, and you will text me in a few weeks right?

661,cag0rr,Throwaway12239029,I [24M] and unsure how to best handle my relationship with female friend [23F] who I am cautiously interested in,"I have known this girl since 5th grade, she was my absolute best friend for several years of high school before we grew apart. Hung out every day, told each other everything, everyone thought we were dating. I was definitely into her the whole time but she didn‚Äôt feel the same way, and I was too awkward to tell her anyway.

We recently reconnected since we graduated and got jobs near our hometown. We bumped into each other at a bar 6 months or so ago and she kept commenting on how different I am now and she can‚Äôt believe I am the same dorky nerdy kid that I was in middle and high school. She flirted a bunch, but I had a girlfriend and lightly made sure she knew that and she stopped. She later said that she really wanted to be as close as we once were. I liked the idea of that but it would have been unfair to my then girlfriend to have this girl from my past who she had never heard of become my second best friend. 

Well about 5 months have passed, my girlfriend and I broke up, and this girl invites me out to get a drink with her friends for her birthday. I head out, and she introduces me to her boyfriend, which is fine. Then she starts talking about how he‚Äôs an alcoholic and can‚Äôt stay in the relationship any longer in front of him so and starts crying into my chest. 

One thing to know about her is she is extremely open, unimaginably flirty, and will hit on literally every single guy she talks to or meets and is a very sexual person. That is not me being toxic - that is her personality and I love her for it. But it does cause some issues I will explain. 

The other night she randomly reached out to me asking what I was doing on Saturday. As it happened we were planning a day of drinking on our lake and going out to the bars at night. I invited her and she was beyond excited to come join us with her one female friends. Now all of my friends know her, and they kept asking if I‚Äôm into her. I say not really she‚Äôs just a flirty friend, and then they all start arguing about who gets to hook up with her which is really rude to say about her. I obviously am into her at least a bit but she‚Äôs still in a relationship and I just got out of mine a month or so ago and didn‚Äôt want to cause any problems. She also has complained to me before that most guys just want something from her and then stop talking to her after they get that and I don‚Äôt want her to think I would do that to her. 

Anyway she comes over, we are having a good time, and then my friends start horning in. My one friend is swimming with her and he asks me ‚Äúdo I have it?‚Äù In relation to the girl. I said no and he kind of gave up. Another guy asked me to hook them up. Another one started putting his arm around her and flirting the whole night. By the end of it they were holding hands and her hands were on his thighs at the bar. We came home and she and him went skinny dipping. Me and her friend would have joined but she got sick and I wanted to make sure that she was okay. He came inside and went downstairs pretty quick, and she came inside and talked to me about how that was a mistake and she just laid on the dock with her towel over her and how guilty she feels because she has a boyfriend. Wait what? Yeah, nobody knew and I was under the impression they had broken up. Upon saying this she strips naked in front of me to change into her PJs. Later on in the night I wake up to her sitting on my crotch in my bed asking me to help her turn the TV off downstairs because it‚Äôs too bright to sleep. This morning we talked about how we have a lot of catching up to do, and she sent me a few flirty texts and we agreed we will hang out much more. 

The problems I need help with: I am cautiously interested in her romantically but am not able to tell if she is interested because every word she says to any male in existence is flirtatious. With any other girl I would take it as interest, but this is just how she is to most people. My other issue is that I am no longer comfortable bringing her around my friends because not only are they trying to use her, she usually tries to hook up with someone too. No, I cannot tell her what to do, but I think it is reasonable to not want to enable the girl I‚Äôm interested in to hook up with multiple of my best friends. If I was not into her I would not mind, but I‚Äôm afraid that she is one of those people that I will just always have something for. Even if it was someone I didn‚Äôt know I wouldn‚Äôt really care, but it‚Äôs different when it‚Äôs your own friends. 

Does anyone have advice on what to do to best manage these relationships? How would you try to gauge interest with a person like this without making your relationship weird? She is planning on breaking up with her boyfriend this week, but then I don‚Äôt want to jump on her the second it‚Äôs over. In the meantime though I don‚Äôt want to have to fend off my own friends every time she comes over. How can I support her in her breakup while also conveying that I would be interested in something? I care about her as a person but also want her even if it was just an understanding that there‚Äôs an attraction between us (if there is one) and my friends are off limits. 

TLDR: I have interest in a long time friend who is hyper sexual and don‚Äôt want my roommates/friends trying to hook up with her. I can‚Äôt tell if she is interested in me, and I don‚Äôt know how to tactfully say that I‚Äôm not okay with her hooking up with my best friends. She is breaking up with her boyfriend soon though (it was a month long relationship and she couldn‚Äôt break up with him because his dad died) and I don‚Äôt want to jump on her the second it ends either. No idea how to handle it.",2019-07-08 03:39:18,4,2,relationship_advice
662,cag0qg,JerseyBoy2618,I (21M) feel like I rushed into my 11 month relationship with my boyfriend (20M) and I'm unsure If I want it to continue.,"I met my boyfriend in August of last year through dating apps. As we've dated it progressed fairly quickly and he ended up saying ""I love you"" by month 2 which is faster than it's ever happened for me. I felt pressured and said it back but I didn't really mean it at the time. I sort of assumed I would develop the feeling as time passed.

Throughout college I've dated two other people and done my fair share of hookups. I'm bi and being with guys is something I didn't start doing until I went to college, far from my parents.

He and I are now onto month 11 and I've felt pressured (not by him) numerous times to introduce him to my family and meet his. I've  never come out to my parents but I know they would accept the fact I'm bi. He, on the other hand, is out to his extremely religious parents who have shamed him for dating guys and dating me. This is putting pressure on me to come out to my parents since they are not intolerant.

He lives three states away during the summer so that doesn't help either.

Right now I just feel like we rushed into this and I dont share the same intensity of feelings towards him as he does with me. He lives three states away during the summer so that doesn't help either. I feel like I'm lying but I don't exactly know how to break it to him.",2019-07-08 03:39:11,0,1,relationship_advice
663,cag0ci,AllsWellEnds_745,I (M/27) am looking to get advice on knowing when the time is right to move for girlfriend (F/25)?,"Some background (may be a lil lengthy), please forgive the formatting as I am on mobile:

I met this pretty cool girl 14 months ago while I was getting ready to leave an old state, she lives in a different state that is neither my old state or new state. However we don‚Äôt live too far and have been able to see each other several times since we met last May. Officially been dating since October. 

Through a lot of posts I‚Äôve seen and read online about LDRs, it seems that it is important to have a final plan to close the distance in the end. I moved to where I am now for an awesome job oppurtunity that came up. I would definitely not mind moving to where she lives, I actually think I prefer her metro better as I‚Äôve visited there a decent amount of times. I‚Äôm just not sure how soon i‚Äôll be ready to do that primarily because I‚Äôm thinking i‚Äôd have to take a decent pay cut to move out there.  I also have currently been in the current job for 11 months, &amp; previous job was 18 months.  Current job is a great job w/ great pay and benefits too. 

She‚Äôs pretty settled where she‚Äôs at, she likes the area, &amp; her parents helped buy a house so she‚Äôs chillin pretty nicely out there. She hasn‚Äôt seemed super pleased at work but I don‚Äôt think she ultimately wants to leave where she‚Äôs working. 

I‚Äôm also a little hesitant to moving out there too because I feel like i‚Äôd be giving up a great job for a potentially less good job, &amp; if I did move out there it would be mostly for her at this point. I fear that if I were to do so &amp; take a ‚Äòlesser job‚Äô and the whole thing not work out, I would have taken a super L while she wouldn‚Äôt have really lost anything in the process. I kind of feel bad feeling that away about it, but I do...it‚Äôd be a no brainer if I could take a step up job-wise to move out there but I don‚Äôt foresee this being the case.

I love this girl, she‚Äôs an awesome character, her parent s are great and we‚Äôve been making it work great so far. I recently saw her and miss her a lot. It just made me think that it‚Äôs been over a year, it doesn‚Äôt seem like she would move, &amp; not sure when I would be ready to move yet...how did you all know when it was the right time? Any advice on all this, thanks.",2019-07-08 03:38:02,2,1,relationship_advice
664,cag07r,OOFMLThrowaway93,Is it right for me (25M) to worry and stress over about my BF (26M) due to financial and physical differences?,"So me and my boyfriend have been dating for about 2 years now and it has been great. But as the title goes, we are different in how we view the world and also he is waaaay out of my league. I grew up very poor with parents who lived paycheck to paycheck and got to go to a university on a full needs based ride. He on the other hand is very wealthy, his dad is a frequent donor to the university that we met at. 

&amp;#x200B;

We met at our university and have been dating casually for about 8 months before become a full fledged relationship. It started of great but we have had our tremendous ups and downs in the relationship due to our big differences. As said before, he is very wealthy and I am not, I stress about this because sometimes I feel like a moocher and take advantage of him since he has more money. He also knows I didn't grow up with much and am very frugal with everything I do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like to go out much or spend much on myself because I stress too much about losing everything I have or dealing with embarrassing things like my card getting declined as it has happened before or some sort of financial issue. He tends to be very callous with his money and spends a lot and is also still supported by his parents. For example, his parents pay for his rent and all other expenses. I pay my own chunk of the rent and expenses on my own and reject his and his parents' money for financial aspects because I don't want to be a burden or feel that I owe them in some way. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other part that stresses me is the physical differences in the relationship. He is extremely attractive and I know myself very well to say that I am not up to his caliber in the looks or physique department at all. I have been overweight for most of my life and for the past few years have started to lose a lot of weight and he played sports and is very fit. I would say now I am average but still have some fat that still needs to be burned off while he still stays beautiful. 

&amp;#x200B;

I always have anxiety because I notice the glances that strangers make and remarks that his friends and family members have made about our compatibility. I constantly worry that I am not good enough and that he can do better. I also have stress in regards to some things they have said about me and how I am not worthy of him or I will never be good enough for him. I talk to him about these things but he thinks I shouldn't let them bother me and have had fights about his lack of understanding.

&amp;#x200B;

That's the point though, it does bother me because I keep thinking to myself ""why me?"", ""are you sure?"". I get afraid sometimes because I know he can do better and I fear that he will eventually find someone better and I have to fend for myself. I always feel like I will also fuck it up by doing something irrational and do something that shows him I am truly not right for him.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I be worried and have all this stress or am I just overreacting and need to take a literal chill pill?",2019-07-08 03:37:39,5,3,relationship_advice

&amp;#x200B;

I(M23) love my girlfriend(F22), she's beautiful, kind and my first serious girlfriend. We've have been together for 2 years and we get along and enjoy the presence of each other ( I think we do ). But we do not have a lot in common and I was wondering where do you draw the line for opposites to attract. I have been having thoughts of breaking up with her and have shared it briefly/drunkenly with my friends. Ever since I did that I have been stirring the pot but I feel I could be looking at this from a selfish one-sided way. 

We do not have anything in common. She loves to drink, party, rave all the time, and has no other hobbies besides that. That's how we met but I have outgrown that lifestyle. I still go out from time to time, and have the casual drink with friends but not to her intensity and clubbing. That being said, when I do go out and go clubbing I go only with my friends, I have no interest to go out with her and her friends, I have gone out with her friends 3-4 times since I've been with her because I don't click with them, I feel uncomfortable around them and am consistently putting up a fake act/smile I feel I shouldn't be feeling that. 

I'm basically a nerdy CHAD btw. I love to paint models, DM in DND, play videogames all day and night. Fitness is also a critical part of my life as it dictates my day and food. It definitely isn't part of my girlfriend's life as I've noticed she has been gaining weight and her body was starting to turn me off. I've posted about this before but  I've hinted to her, and told her bluntly about my concern. I've encouraged her, pushed her, shown her workout schedules/ routines, invited her to join me as she used to be very fit but she's letting herself go. I also go camping a lot/ go on overnight hikes, and practice bushcraft with only my friends. I've invited her to these things but she never comes. 

She accepts my hobbies and I cherish that but I feel like I want someone who I can shares these hobbies and experiences with. Is that selfish of me?

We are also polar opposites in personality. 

I'm a cold and blunt person, and I can handle a lot of stress prob due to my army history and nothing really ever bother me. She, on the other hand, can't handle stress, or plans changing at the moment. She cries and has a lot due to anxiety/panic attacks. She relies on me heavily and leans on me for support and I'm always there for her and encourage her even encouraging her to get professional help. However, I sometimes struggle to comprehend her problems and worries not gonna lie it angers me. Additionally, I never lie to her so I accidentally/ bluntly say stupid/mean comments which lead to even more conflict. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing is due to my seasonal summer job, I go weeks to months without seeing her. I honestly don't care and can go days without talking to her, I obviously don't but I feel this is a hint of some feeling I have for her/ feeling I don't have for her. 

Besides this new problem, everything is smooth between us, no problems, no fighting, we stay in contact with each other and because of that I fear to break up with her because I feel it could be a dumb mistake, I like the security of the relationship, and feel she would be destroyed if I did break up with her. But I also don't know if I want to live like this and have these thoughts, I even have thoughts of cheating ( I would never do it but the simple idea that those thoughts have crossed my mind baffles me).",2019-07-08 03:29:56,1,0,relationship_advice

(Sorry if my spelling is bad, it‚Äôs because im actually from Germany)

So, My S/O (F22 ) and me (M25) decided a few Months ago to move in together.  We were a Couple for 2.5 Years from this Point. 

Last year she had to move to another City for School where she lived for one Year. We never had Problems when we were together but a Long Distant Relationship wasn‚Äôt easy for both us. 

We had our fair Share of Ups and Downs but went through all of this. 

We visited each other when we could and when we saw each other in Person everything was Fine. We had some Issues considering Money, because it was hard for her to find a new Job to pay her Rent etc. so I often payed for her Food or other Activities. 

6 Months ago we both decided to move in together. We found a nice apartment (which is beautiful) and everything seemed ok. We both had new Jobs starting this Month and I was very happy, after that one very stressful Year, to live with her. 

2 Weeks ago we packed her Stuff and brought it to our new apartment but she had 2 more Weeks before her School is finished so she moved in with her Best Friend from School (F) because her Apartment was already empty at this Point. 

Yesterday would‚Äôve been the First Day of living together but after a cold Smalltalk, she breaks up with me, telling me that her and her Best Friend are now in Love and that she wants to live with her instead. 

AFTER we paid the Rent, bought new Furniture and so on, which she couldn‚Äôt afford in the first Place and you can guess who paid for all of that...

Unfortunately I cant pay the Rent on my own so i guess I have to move yet again and also deal with her break Up at the same Time...

What are the next Steps i should take in this Situation?",2019-07-08 03:24:54,5,2,relationship_advice

At that point I was ok, I was ok with being just friends, but then she started acting like if she wanted to be more than that but not really. 

We planned a trip to another city for a music festival, she cancelled me twice before she finally decided that she wanna go, I was super happy with this and then she cancelled one week before the festival to go to another trip that she had planned. My depressed ass couldn't handle all this and i was ready to kill myself, luckily my family help me to get professional attention, i been taking antidepressants for the last 7 months. And the only times that I feel bad is after see her

Last night she told me that she has a boyfriend but she is in an open relationship, some kind of polygamy, and I feel like she was open to try something with me but I end up super drunk and crying for her

I don‚Äôt know if would be good keep seeing her

My happiest moments are when I‚Äôm with her but is killing me not been able to be on a formal relationship; also I don‚Äôt know how this polygamy thing can play out

College was in session and I had the baby full time and was working too while he just worked around 24 a week. He broke up with me out of the blue because he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know if he loved me.‚Äù I was heartbroken because this was supposed to be the love of my life. Next day he calls and says it was the worst mistake of his life and wants to get back together and like a dummy I go back to him and spend the night. I went through his phone and found out he was talking to another girl for about a week and they were going to go on dates and he was picking her up from work. When I asked him about it he said I wasn‚Äôt giving him enough attention, I left him in the middle of the night and only communicated if it involved our child. We split for a month and I was on summer break, during that month I went clubs had a brief hookup with some other guy and was happy. However I did a big no no. His best friend texted me saying he wanted to hookup I would never but him and my bestie use to talk so I told her and she wanted revenge so I had her stay the night and she texted him off my phone. We told him that it was actually her and it was a mess. A couple days later my baby dad texts me this long paragraph about how he was so sorry and wanted to be friends and he‚Äôs tired of us just being parents. I had sex with my hookup man the day we were supposed to meet and went to the gym and had sex with my baby dad that afternoon. He poured his heart out to me saying how he missed me that last month and was miserable without me and he had no one to support him. I fell for it and we were being honest and I told him about his best friend, he asked me did I have sex with anyone else and I was truthful (I didn‚Äôt tell him about that morning though) and he was hurt.

I forgave him until two weeks later I found out he picked up two more girls saying he wanted to hurt me like I hurt him. I left again and somehow I went back to him and we were actually doing good until we went camping this Friday with his family and his friend called saying he got him an oop with the girl my baby dad asked for and she wanted to see how he looked first.

This far, we've never felt like marriage was necessary, but he regularly discusses that he wants children and wants to be with me forever. It seems like he thinks his conversations are innocent, however, the comment about being free and uninhibited is a betrayal, and quite honestly not my understanding of our relationship.

685,cafuvv,Yourfavoritepsyco,Unsure of whether or not to pursue possible long distance relationship between me (17 F) and (M 19),"So I  (17 F)  haven't really dated much, this summer I got out there a bit and made a tinder,(noting the fact that I was 17, and guys I talked to knew this). I have since stopped using it but had it going for a month bordering on two. A few guys seemed promising but most just wanted hookups or sexual favors which is not what I was personally looking for.

In the process of talking to more guys and getting more used to the so called dating game, I realized because of past abuse among other circumstances, that I have a tendency to be draw to the same type of guys who don't treat me very well and it usually never pans out and I end up getting hurt and or used by them in the end.

The guy I was referring to in the title is the first guy I've met who deviates from the other type of guys I've liked. He does live 3 hours away and we were planning on meeting in the middle soon and trying to start spending more time together as we have been talking for almost two weeks. Which I acknowledge isn't really all that long. And my mom mentioned today something about me not being mature enough for a long term  relationship, and I see where she is coming from. He seems to really like me and we always look forward to talking and I've never had a guy be this interested in me, although because we haven't been talking for too long I sometimes wonder why he seems to like me so much. 

I do know I have been looking for a relationship because I haven't been getting the love and affection I needed from my family of origin. And so I've been trying to be careful, but I do like this guy, but we're going to different colleges and he already lives 3 hours away and when I leave for school I will be another hour away. So I need some advice. Should we try to pursue the relationship or should I let it go? I think it would be a lot easier for me to let it go but I don't know how to explain it to him without upsetting him because he is very important to me.

Tldr: Should I try to pursue a long distance relationship as my first relationship or just let it go?",2019-07-08 03:22:13,2,1,relationship_advice

I haven't seen my boyfriend(18m) for a month due to my father kicking him out of the house after he saw his hand on my belly. It was nothing sexual my stomach hurt and I asked if he could rub it,it does help me. Shit hit the fan with him and my mother after he found out I was using an old ipod to text him because my phone had gotten taken away. I wouldn't give him the password because he has always controlled my electronics. My mom had let me have it as well so i wasnt hiding anything.He is a major control freak and had huge anger issues. So when I wouldn't give him the password he flipped out and started knocking things off my end table. He then proceeds to pick it up and was about to throw it at me. My brother and mother step in before he can actually hit me with it. My brother put his hand on my dad's shoulder and told him to calm down. My dad reacts by putting both of his hands around his neck and choking him. We left the house after that to stay with my uncle for a while. We come back and I slowly get to have my stuff back (phone,make up,etc.) I finally can talk to my boyfriend without using my moms, and cousins phones. My brother and my boyfriend have been fighting recently due to everyone blaming my boyfriend for what's going on. When it was both of our faults for knowing the rules but not following them. My mom is super pissed about them fighting and says since my bf is 18 and my brother is 14 that he needs to ignore him when my brother says very mean things to him and starts most of the fights as well. So we had made plans to go see the new spiderman movie last night and me and my mom were already fighting because some friends bailed and it was just us and another friend. When I got out of the car my bf asked where my brother was since he was going to come and my mom yelled he doesn't wanna because you have been an asshole to him and fighting with him. My bf didn't want to argue so he responded with fair enough and my mother took that as disrespectful I guess and hops out of the car and shoves my bf into the car next to us and threatening him. I couldn't do anything because if I put my hands on her it would have just escalated and I was extremely embarrassed. So all was ok after a bit since he was obviously pissed. The movie ends and we are walking to my friends car since my mom said she would not take me home after and to find my way home. He pulled me to the side and said he can't take it anymore. He told me he has suffered a mental beating due to my family and that he loves me and that he us sorry but it's best if we break up for both of our safety. Idk what to do now.

During this time she mentioned several times that she didn't want a boyfriend, which was ""fine by me"" because I didn't expect anything else to happen. We kept on talking and getting to know each other during her time abroad, there was flirting, sexting but no nudes, in general it was very fun healthy flirting.

  


Now she's back and still says she doesn't want to be in a relationship, but keeps on mentioning that she doesn't want one right now, maybe in a few months because ""she doesn't know"". She also mentioned that she doesn't want to get physical anymore because we're not actually dating, but we went out yesterday and I impulsively kissed her, I apologized but then she kissed me back.

  


I'm confused with her ambiguous answers, her behavior also indicates that she doesn't want me to leave, she wants me to be there for her. I asked her if she thought about having a \*no-commitment\* relationship like friends with benefits and she seemed to like the idea (this was after kissing). Before we parted ways that night she confessed that the reason she didn't push me away when I kissed he and then kissed me was because she was horny. But it didn't feel like that, maybe I'm reading too much into it.

  


I would love it if she changed her mind and said she did want a relationship but I'm not ready to just drop things and would rather be just friends with benefits than to be nothing at all.

692,cafrzo,wstimpson99,My girlfriend is extremely emotionally dependent on me,"     I‚Äôm a 20 year old college guy, with a girlfriend of 3 years who I am very much in love with. I care about her dearly, and absolutely do not want to leave her. However, she is extremely (in my opinion, unhealthily) dependent on me. She has very bad insecurity and anxiety, much of which stems from abuse. She is very lonely, lacking the close friendships that she longs for. She feels like the only thing she has is me, and it makes her very dependent on me. 
     We go to different colleges about 1 hour apart, and for the last year I drove to see her every single weekend, sometimes multiple times a week, due to her need for me to lean on. She has gone through very rough times and has really needed my support. 
     I fear it‚Äôs getting to be very unhealthy, as it‚Äôs harming my studies, eating up gas money and time, and preventing me from engaging in activities on my campus. She has insisted that she wants to see me constantly, and I fear that if I don‚Äôt choose to, then she could really spiral in a bad way. I even fear her being self harming.
    I feel very trapped. I love her very much and don‚Äôt ever want her to feel lonely, but I also can feel her need for me beginning to become suffocating. Also, due to her insecurity, if I ever talk about seeing each other a little bit less, she interprets it as my not being happy with her and wanting to get away from her. This is not the case at all, I love seeing her very much, I just need to be able to live my own life. I think it would be healthy for her too if she could become more independent.

693,cafrl2,dpope2020,My(18m) girlfriend(18F) tried killing herself and her family blames it on me.,"This will be my first post on relationship advice so bear with me please. It‚Äôs been many months since this happened so I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. 



A little bit of backstory; she has been suffering from mental illnesses for a little over 4 years now from mental abuse at school and past relationships. She struggles with depression but her family refuses to believe it and did not get her the help she needed after I had director spoken to them about it. They shrugged it off now I mind you this is her 4 attempt at suicide. 

Me and said girlfriend have been dating on and off for two years now. We have both been the cause of splitting up a couple times. I had really realized her mental illnesses in October of 2018 when we had broken up and she turned to hard core pills and I did my best to get her off. We broke up because we were a classic toxic relationship over protective, and controlling of one another. You all know, you‚Äôve seen your friends or even yourself in that position. But we broke up and I felt freed from my ‚Äúcapturer‚Äù I was alive and full of energy but she still lingered in my head because I cared for her and I did not want to see her go down a bad path to ruin her life. After many months of her begging me to get back together in February of 2019 I finally accepted and we started dating again, but soon after that I realized I made a terrible mistake because she had definitely not made the changes she said she did, she was still controlling and still jealous. I did everything to get out of it but I pitied her to much and couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it. So in March of 2019 I finally gathered the courage and sent her a text because I could not bring myself to see her in person and watch her break down but I soon realized this was a wrong move as she took to the roads to find me and this is where it went wrong. After hours of her driving to find where I was, multiple calls to my parents, her showing up at my house, her calling her friends doing anything she could to find me. I caved in and called her to see how she was doing and then I caved in even more and said it‚Äôs okay and we can make things work out. She didn‚Äôt believe me and went driving(she‚Äôs a horrible driver while in this manic state)  I had to get off the phone and go to the hospital. I had heard nothing from her in 90 minutes I had a feeling something had happened but I wasn‚Äôt going to let my anxiety get the best of me. An hour later I got a call from her cousin telling me she was getting an airlift from the interstate because she had gotten into a accident. My whole world had stopped right there. I didn‚Äôt think it was on purpose no one did but it was, she was going 90+ MPH and rear ended a semi truck and tried to commit suicide. Her first question after coming to was ‚Äúhow did I live‚Äù the first responder had told us. Now her family blames me for everything that had happened that night. I still pity her that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still in her life but I have a sense of hope in my gut that I believe we can work everything out.  Her family has threatened to snap my neck if he ever sees me with her again. Her mother said I do not and will never support you two being together again. I understand this is how love is supposed to be for a family member. It has been 4 months since the accident and her family is not budging on how they see me. 

What do I do here guys, I am stuck in a pit of my own doing and I have no idea how to escape.

My gf really doesn‚Äôt like this friend but i have assured her that nothing will happen between us.,"So im currently sitting at home rethinking the situation. Let‚Äôs call my friend ‚ÄúE‚Äù. Lets call me ‚ÄúAA‚Äù and my gf is just my gf. At the beginning of today my gf and I were hanging out watching movies whenever out of nowhere she grabs my phone to look through my texts. It‚Äôs not like im hiding anything but it‚Äôs still weird but anyhow she sees that E texted me earlier this morning then I texted her back saying ‚Äúhey im hanging with my gf i‚Äôll text you later‚Äù

My gf instantly says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like her‚Äù, but my gf doesn‚Äôt even know her outside of like us having mutual friends. After, my gf continues to look through my phone kind of jokingly asking me what groupchats are what and seeing who texted me. 

I replied ‚Äúwhy not‚Äù

she said ‚ÄúI know how girls are and even if she had feelings for you, she wouldn‚Äôt tell you‚Äù

‚ÄúShe hasn‚Äôt made any advances towards me at all and if she does tell me she has feelings for me, I‚Äôll just politely turn her down.‚Äù

‚ÄúAA you don‚Äôt understand where im coming from!‚Äù she just like completely stood over me while saying that.

‚ÄúI kinda do understand but i don‚Äôt see why it has to be such a huge deal‚Äù

Then she noticed a groupchat with E in it planning to go see a movie at the theater. She acted all sad/upset about it. 

I told her ‚Äúits not just her theres like all of my best friends in it, you can come if you want.‚Äù

My gf didn‚Äôt really respond to that. She asked if i wanted a mint after we ate. I said no because I was drinking water. A couple minutes later i asked for the mint then she reached for the mints and said ‚Äúare you gonna stop talking to E‚Äù

She kept asking that at least 12 times. She kept telling me she didn‚Äôt like her and she kept saying how she was going to block her on my phone. She kept trying to take my phone so she could text her but i didn‚Äôt allow her to. She kept getting upset about it until i left but i keep thinking about it.

Married 14 years. 

3 years ago started feeling weird; lost confidence and sense of individuality.  Sought counselling to try and figure it out. Basically, I am more focused on pleasing others than myself.  It‚Äôs a guilt thing. 

Caused a huge rift in marriage - basically both of us lost interest in one another but no one left because of kid. 

Tried couples counselling. 

A year ago began to get close with someone.  Lit my fire like an inferno!  Not physically but intellectually; and emotionally made me feel safe. 

if I were in a happy marriage this wouldn‚Äôt be an appropriate relationship but since we are both miserable, am I the asshole?

New relationship is threatening to leave if I don‚Äôt make a move. 

I feel stuck because we have a 5 yr old but I can‚Äôt seem to get interested in this marriage again and feel like I may be about to lose a very important person in my life and a chance at being happy. 

Feels like I‚Äôm choosing between being happy or being responsible. 

In reality, I am a great dad - or so I‚Äôm told. And I know I will ALWAYS be responsible for my kids, and will certainly have at least joint custody and access, but it does feel somewhat like I‚Äôm leaving them (50% of the time) to be happy. 

So - am I the asshole for leaving a miserable marriage to be happy with someone else?",2019-07-08 03:10:41,6,1,relationship_advice
697,cafqbb,Mygfisworriedmoney,"My girlfriend is losing her mind over money, how do I get her to relax?","My girlfriend is going crazy about money. She literally can not go one day anymore without freaking about money. She was working 2 jobs for a while but was asked to step down from one of her positions due to her poor mental health.

She makes about 1/4 of what I make now, and it is is not enough to cover her bills. Shes been blowing through her savings, and has admitted to me, that at the end of this month, she will not be able to afford to pay her rent.

Now this is not a problem at all. I have been living with her rent free for o months, and I would love to help her pay her rent. She will not let me. According to her, she began renting this place when she could afford the rent on her own, so it's her burden to figure out how to pay it. She also mentions how I still pay rent at my old place. My lease was supposed to expire last month, but my roommate went behind my back and renewed the lease, and still needs me to help with rent till his other friend moves in, in 3 months.theres a lot of drama surrounding that, but I dont really want to get into it.

Her parents also are offering her money to help with bills. Her sister has tried to give her money, but she just refuses and then continues to have anxiety attacks every day about her lack of money. It's getting the point that she wont even let people buy her food, she'll just starve for days, or only eat ramen

Her dad finally confessed to me where he thinks her inability to accepts financial help comes from. He also suffers from mental illness, and had a substance abuse problem for most of her childhood. My girlfriend has a genetic disorder that cost her parents a lot of money. Her father said for about 10 years half their income was going to paying her medical bills. He resented her for while. Whenever her mother spent any money on her, he would flip out. He would call her a leech, a gold digger, say she wasnt capable of loving anyone who didnt have money, he accused her of manipulating her mother to get stuff, that when she turned 18 and they were no longer responsible for her he would celebrate her homelessness. Honestly its sick what he used to tell her, and I'm surprised they still have a relationship. He has changed from what I can tell, and he begs her all the time to accept money from them.

For a while her parents had been covering her medical bills behind her back (they were still sent to her parents house) but she found out and changed the address they were sent to. So now she has even more of a financial burden.

Shes considering opening another credit card to cover her debt, but shes already swimming in debt and i really dont want her to do this.

But the scariest things is that she is suicidal, and I am scared that if she runs out of money, she'll just kill herself over it. She has attempted in pass for smaller reasons. She is in therapy, but I dont know what they talk about, so I dont know if she brought up her financial situation.

How do I get her to accept my help, or any help??",2019-07-08 03:09:10,14,14,relationship_advice

She has never complimented me on my successes she‚Äôs only criticized me. Every year for her birthday I give her a birthday card and a present and she says I don‚Äôt want that I want obedience and all I ever do is obey her. For God sakes I live in her house! I couldn‚Äôt leave even if I wanted to. I remember I mentioned I wanted to go abroad and she made me feel so bad about going. She instilled so much fear in me that even if I would‚Äôve decided to go she would not allow me to leave the house to get to the airport. The worst part is not looking like my mother in any physical way, I think she secretly hates me for it. I have always been a little heavier and she‚Äôs controlled everything I‚Äôve eaten since I was a kid. When I was young I was almost 200lbs but I‚Äôve lost a lot of weight since then now I‚Äôm 140lbs. And I would assume that she would be proud and would stop being controlling about what I eat but instead she criticizes me. If I eat anything that‚Äôs unhealthy even on a cheat day she has a field day with her criticisms. Don‚Äôt eat that you‚Äôre going to get fat, all you ever do is eat candy and cakes that‚Äôs why your so fat, you have lose weight look at your stomach. She‚Äôs never satisfied.

When I try to communicate to her how I‚Äôm feeling she says I have anger problems and I need to work on not being rebellious because I have to respect her. She never apologizes for her behavior. and I‚Äôm at breaking point.

701,cafopo,throwawaybecauseuno,"When my [30M] girlfriend [28F] sits on top of me during sex, it hurts. (NSFW)","Throw away for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been with my GF for over 7 years now but this problem has slow crept up on me and I'm really not sure how to handle this tactfully.

&amp;#x200B;

My GF has (I would say) mild vaginismus.  That is to say that when we have sex, the only way I can enter her is with her on top of me and she lowers herself down gradually until she is comfortable.  After that she is fine and we can change positions.  But if I try to enter her any other way it's really painful for her and we have to stop.  Up until now, this has been fine.  We do some foreplay, grab the lube, she hops on top, in it goes, change the position, happy days.  


However now this is becoming a problem for me.  Over the last year she has been slowly gaining more and more weight.  So now when she sits on top of me it's start to actually hurt my pelvis and lower navel area.   At first I thought I would just get over it, but recently with her gaining more weight it's becoming rather unbearable. To make matters more complicated, I've actually had surgery twice on my navel for hernias on each side of my navel so the stomach lining there is weak.  So I'm also kind of afraid I might get an injury if this continues since this is where most of the pain is located when she is on top of me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I want to say right off the bat, she is not really really overweight and I don't have a problem with her being a little overweight.  She seems happy with herself and I still find her attractive as the first day I met her, but now when we have sex I'm finding it harder to control my discomfort when she sits with her full weight on top of me.

&amp;#x200B;

She is 'trying' to lost weight.  And why I say 'trying' is because she doesn't control her eating (she eat crisps like no tomorrow) and she only hops on the exercise bike when she feels like it.  But she feels she is doing the best she can with her weight.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm really at a loss on how to approach this problem.  I don't want to make her feel bad about her body, I don't want to discourage her losing weigh when she feels she is doing everything she can.  I don't want to blame her because of her vaginismus either.  So any advice on how to approach this subject would be really helpful.",2019-07-08 03:04:47,9,1,relationship_advice
702,cafodr,wearygirlfriend,Boyfriend's relationship with childhood friend driving me insane,"My boyfriend has been friends with his neighbor for the past 15 years. They grew up together, and she admitted to liking him for 11 of those years, up until two years ago. Her crush on him was to the extent that she would end relationships because she could not move on from him, and would try and sabotage his chances with other females in his life because she wanted him so badly to herself (this caused them to stop talking for a brief period because he was so angry with her for interfering in his love life).

Present day, she has a boyfriend. But she complains about her relationship with him to my boyfriend on a weekly basis, asking him to come over and comfort her and provide advice etc. I trust my boyfriend fully and know that he purely views her as a sister, but I've also expressed my discomfort to him simply because she liked him for so long and to such a large extent.

He gets upset when I bring up this issue because he never saw her in any other way than as a friend. I've explained that I would perhaps feel differently if she was now in a relationship that she is very satisfied with, but that isn't the case. I feel like if I weren't in the picture, she would still like to be with him. And knowing she's ended relationships in the past over my boyfriend just shows me what she is capable of.

I don't know what the solution is here, because I can continue to trust my boyfriend but honestly dont know how I can move past my discomfort with their dynamic in general.

Edit: I trust him, but feel a little disrespected provided that he has cancelled plans on me to hang out with her when she so desperately needs him, left the dinner table urgently to talk on the phone with her about her relationship problems, and lied to me about hanging out with her to avoid me being upset (this was after I opened up to him about all of this).",2019-07-08 03:03:50,6,1,relationship_advice

I am really confused on what to do.  So pretty much what happened is, I met her this year at school. So let's rewind a couple months before today.  At first I was just friends with her. I pretty much met her with a mutual friend. So we hanged out a bit and I used to crack jokes and all and make her laugh alot. She asked me for snap and instagram, which I don't have so I told her. But soon as time wore I got more and more attracted. Soon I got her number and we started chatting mostly innocent things, but slightly flirting. However that ended real quick in like a week or so, one day we were talking about past relationships and she said she had a ""boyfriend"". Note I put the apostrophes around the word boyfriend because, I usually see her around school and not once did the ever see her with her ""boyfriend"" also it seems really odd to me that. But didn't say anything about it to her. At this point (note is it still around two months ago) I stopped texting her, but I still talked to her, without flirting this time). But around a month ago or so, she started texting me again, it started off as questions about school assignments and all. But soon we went back to flirting again. But on the last of school I was hanging out with her and we were talking, she bought up the topic of her boyfriend again. Which kinda confused me, because if she had a boyfriend, why would she text me and even flirt with me? So I for the rest of the time we were together I kinda have her the cold shoulder by looking mostly at my phone instead of giving her attention. She causually smiled and tried to look at what I was doing and my phone and I just told her I was checking emails for a job. And that was that That was more than two weeks ago. And we never talked since, not even a text. To be extremely honest I really miss her, I know it sounds weird
Tl;Dr I have a female friend who apparently has a boyfriend but used to text and flirt with me. I am seriously confused a out her intentions. 
All of this really confused the shit outta me, I was attracted to her ngl until I heard she had a boyfriend, but what doesn't make sense is her flirting with me. I told a couple of my friends about this situation and they said she probably bought up the topic of her ""boyfriend"" to make me jealous and she probably doesn't even have a boyfriend. I am seriously confused by her and any type of advice is extremely appreciated. Just to clarify I am not the type of guy who flirts with girls who have a boyfriend. The reason why I went along with her flirting is because I though her and her boyfriend broke up or something. If she even had a boyfriend.",2019-07-08 03:02:42,8,1,relationship_advice
704,cafnq0,KindredBog,How do I tell a close friend that he should go for less attractive women?,"So I (21M) have a close buddy (21M) who I've been friends with since I was 10 years old that can't seem to get any girls. He's kind of overweight and not particularly handsome and a little socially awkward but all in all is an extremely sweet person.

He's hooked up with some Tinder girls who I would say were around his level of attractiveness. But when he tries to find girls he wants to be in a relationship with he always shoots for very attractive women.

He just recently asked out this girl he's started working with who is a lot more attractive then he can probably pull. She politely told him that she had to work that night but it sounded fun and I don't know if he's taking the hint or not. He's always really optimistic and says oh that's okay I'll just start with being friends with her and you'll never know what can happen.

He does get sad about the fact that he can't find a girl to date though. But this is the third or fourth time he's seriously pursued someone and it hasn't worked presumably because they are just not attracted to him and it's kind of bumming me out because I love the guy. 

I want to kindly tell him that he should be going for less attractive women but I don't want to say that because I feel like that would seriously hurt his feelings. It's strange because he knows that the girls he hooks up with on Tinder aren't very good looking but still continues to try and date very good looking women.

I know that looks aren't everything but it's certainly something that people start with. I just don't think he's going to find success with the girls he keeps going for. Now I know things do happen and sometimes people do date up leagues,  but just for his happiness sake I wish he would start trying to make connections with girls that want to connect with him too.

Any advice on what to say to him?

I have been dating this guy for almost 8 months now but I don‚Äôt know if I will get to completing it really.
Our relationship has been going pretty good for the most part!We love hanging out,going to the movies,the theater,whatever comes up to our agenda!He always comes home and is super friendly with my mom and dad

The problem starts with the two of us.He is a very jealous person and I definitely didn‚Äôt expect that when we were friends.

In order to get to the point,I have stopped talking to a male friend of mine due to his jealousy and honestly any time I end up going out with male friends (one who I‚Äôve known for more than a decade) he has jealousy crisis and wants to act like a child.

Meanwhile I support him going out with his male friends from community college and he loves it (before anyone says there is no cheating that‚Äôs not even part of the problem,I am also friends with his female friends and chat normally with them when I go to his college).
We fight almost everyday when we get together but we have always been a little on the fighting side but normally I could calm it through and comfort the situation but these last weeks even I can‚Äôt keep calm having to get angry every single day

Thinking if this is a temporary problem and if I am making him to be a monster is honestly breaking my mind in half.He is the most lovely person normally but the bad points are bad.Would appreciate help!

Today me and my dad spent the day together and I noticed whenever he was on his phone he was constantly checking a few message boards and texting a lot if different people. This caught my attention because this is very unlike him- however my parents just moved to a new area and I figured he was trying to make some friends or join a gaming group. 


Well I thought that until I had a gut feeling to check the websites he was using and found it was a lot of single women in the new area looking for hookups or from what I read of his phone ""looking for Passion in -new home-""


Part of my thinks this was a fluke, that I just caught him looking at the one NSFW profile. Part of me wants to check his phone to see what else he has been doing. He was very secretive with his phone and I saw him message someone asking if they wanted to go get coffee. I'm just in a mix of wanting to cry and needing to believe my dad wouldn't do this, because when he's around my family everything is normal. My parents are talking about retirement- I can't be the one to ruin that. 


Should I talk to him about it? Bring it up to my mom? Find more concrete evidence before moving forward?

711,cafmbn,dogslifelovin39487,I had sex too early and now I feel awful.,"So, I (25f) started seeing this guy...let's call him Tim (25m). 

  
So Tim met me at a local brewery. I was there by myself and trying to meet friends. He approached me and asked me on a date. I thought he was cute so of course I said yes. First date goes well, and we didn't do anything physical. I explained to him after, though, that I really wanted to be cautious about things and wanted to talk in person about what I wanted and what he wanted, ect. I didn't want to get  hurt. I've been lied to about guy's intentions with me (or saying things I wanted to hear) for sex or physical stuff. I really wanted to avoid this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, we end up somehow going out one night as he invited me. I impulsively said yes. Note that Tim doesn't drink, but I do. This was before we had our talk. In hindsight this was a pretty shitty decision.

&amp;#x200B;

I end up getting pretty drunk from the bars with him and his friends and go back home with him. We end up having sex and since I hadn't had good sex in so long, I pretty much enjoyed myself. However, He was sober and I was VERY intoxicated. I barely remember anything other than feeling good.

&amp;#x200B;

We never got our talk I guess. I didn't think much of it and I think maybe I can just go with the flow. I come to realize after awhile that having sex with him all of the time didn't really make me feel secure. I had an odd, gut feeling that I was being used and I couldn't describe it. Tim would take me out on dates though...and that seemed to counteract  my feelings. I went over last night and surprise, we had sex. But when I got dropped off this morning, I felt empty. Like a pit in my stomach. I didn't really feel good.

&amp;#x200B;

I would get ""I miss you"" texts but...I just felt like something was missing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was so upset about this...like crying upset today and I don't know why. I felt like I went too fast and just went with it because I liked him so much. 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to talk to him about it and tried so hard to keep my composure but ended up crying, telling him that I really needed to not have sex so casually. I told him it was hurting me and that I didn't know him well enough to really trust what he was saying to me was true. He took it personally, like an attack on him and said that he didn't want someone with baggage or any insecurities. He said he didn't want any drama and that he wanted things to feel natural. I understood but I felt kind of weird about how defensive he got. I just repeated myself, saying I didn't want to have sex for a month (which is what I estimate to be what it'll take to gather enough trust). He then told me that I was pushing him away by doing this. He said that an ex withheld sex from his as a manipulative tactic and that it hurt him, so he was worried.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt even worse and felt kind of backed into a corner, and started crying pretty hard and saying ""this is just what I need"" but he kept taking this as if I was convinced he was using me for sex. I'm not, I am pretty sure it's my own problem and if he couldn't oblige with what I needed that was fine, but i feel guilted about my decision to do so...kinda like I was carrying baggage or insecurities.

712,caflh6,Withlovefromme,I‚Äôm Developing Feelings for my Best Friend‚Äôs Boyfriend,"I think the title speaks for itself. The feelings I have developed have been pretty recent. I guess I‚Äôll start from the beginning.

 I [24f] matched with my best friend‚Äôs [22f] boyfriend [26m] on Bumble before they even met. At the time, I had decided it was too soon for me to date again because I had unresolved issues with my ex. So we didn‚Äôt end up going on a date. 

The following week, my friend told me about this cute guy she matched with on bumble and showed me his picture. I actually thought the two would make a good match so I told her I matched with him too and he seemed like a good guy. 
I supported their relationship from the start, he made her happier and helped her get over her ex, which was extremely toxic for her. Each time I spoke with him, I was surprised by how much I got along with him. As I got to know him better, I started to admire qualities about him: his smile, his laugh, his honesty, his helpfulness, and his kindness. I kept telling myself that, since he‚Äôs atheist, and I believe in a higher power out there, things probably wouldn‚Äôt have worked out between me and him anyway. And for a while that was enough. 

But then things got a little more complicated. My best friend actually proposed the idea of a threesome. (She‚Äôs always been bi-curious. Her boyfriend actually told her last week that she can sleep with women and explore her sexuality if she wanted.) Initially, I declined, because I didn‚Äôt want to look at my best friend differently/ complicate our relationship dynamics. But we ended up having the threesome last week (under the influence...). And now that I know that her boyfriend and I have sexual chemistry, it‚Äôs made it even harder to push away my feelings. 

So I guess my question now is: what do I do? Do I admit this to my best friend? Or do I keep it to myself and keep my distance from her and her boyfriend for a while? The absolute last thing I want is to screw up my friendship with my absolute best friend. Her and her boyfriend have been especially supportive of me, after I lost my dad in January and broke up with my ex-fianc√© a few weeks later after he broke my trust (long story). 

Another thing I‚Äôve considered is that maybe I‚Äôm just jealous of their relationship and wish I had a strong bond with someone I loved and vice versa.

I don‚Äôt know how much I should include so I can answer to comments and edit to add more information as needed.

Basically, I‚Äôve suspected my dad of cheating on my mom since I was like in 7th grade. So probably about 3 or 4 years. Recently he‚Äôs done a lot of shit and gotten our family into a lot of legal and financial trouble. Whenever I mention it to my mom, she always mentions how my dad is a mess/something along those times. When I ask her why she married my dad she said it was because she was silly and stupid. She mentioned maybe divorcing him after the legal issues calm down.

Yesterday my boyfriend and I were on a facetime call and he essentially dropped the fact that his mom mentioned to him that one of her friends mentioned to her that my dad is a scumbag womanizer who cheats on his wife. He said it kind of nonchalantly and I was kind of just floored because all the sudden my dad‚Äôs infidelity is dinner table talk for my boyfriend‚Äôs family.

I was kinda just shook because it was a ‚Äúwell, I know that, but how do YOU know that?‚Äù moment.

So today I went through my dad‚Äôs phone. Inappropriate messages to random women on instagram and straight up just soliciting a prostitute and asking her prices on Twitter. I cried in my mom‚Äôs arms for about 15 minutes.

Our relationship before this was already dead but now I want him out of my life. His infidelity is the talk of the town apparently. I talked to my brother (20) and he confirmed that my dad has cheated because he‚Äôs overheard calls, seen texts, and seen online purchases.

I know I have to talk to my mom about it because 1. I want to 2. I want to tell her why I had a breakdown in her arms.

I don‚Äôt know how to bring it up to her and I honestly just don‚Äôt know where to go from here. I have a therapist but I see her in 2 weeks so I have to wait for that support.

715,cafkf9,Wandering55,How to approach a situation when I might not be compatible with my girlfriend?,"I‚Äôve been in a situation where my girlfriend and I were great (mid 20s) , had a lot of things going for us , but recently we‚Äôve been questioning if we‚Äôre compatible. We have many of the same likes and dislikes when it comes to things like raising a family , politics , fun activities , but the one thing we don‚Äôt agree on is intimacy. I‚Äôve never thought of myself as the kind of person that needs intimacy at the level of sex all the time or even that often , but moreso that I need a level of intimacy such as cuddling , kissing , the small things . My girlfriend does not enjoy these sorts of things and we rarely do them anymore and sometimes it bothers her when we do. I‚Äôm not totally sure how to feel about this. We agree on so much but not this one simple thing of me enjoying more intimacy and her wanting less. Is it a case where maybe we‚Äôve just fallen out of love? I truly do care about her well being but I feel as though without that intimacy there‚Äôs little more connection than a friendship between two people . What sort of direction should the relationship go in?",2019-07-08 02:52:31,5,1,relationship_advice
716,cafk6z,walmartpretzels,I think My (18m) girlfriend (18f) is being controlling but idk if she really is,"First time poster and on mobile so forgive format. Before I start some background is due. Me and my girlfriend have been on and off dating since we were both 16 Im not going to outline those past problems in the post bc I feel that she has at least tried to change since.  Whenever we got back together again this time I felt things were going good. At the beginning of this try I had just broken up with an ex girlfriend and about 2 days later she texted me just talking and offering help, a few days of that she wanted to meet up. We met at a restaurant and had a conversation about what was going on and what we wanted if we were to get back together. She basically said that she wanted more dates and time with me and all I had said is that I expected basic decency, respect, and no physical fights (I know already bad) the discussion went well and I felt we understood each other, except I told her I didn't wanna shout it from the rooftops yet, she claimed to understand.

As time goes on I feel more confident that she is good however a couple weeks go by she starts pressuring me to let the cat out of the bag I wasn't entirely comfortable bc I knew the backlash I would receive from friends and family. However I did it was about a week of ""what the fuck are you thinking"" but truth be told I believed her and trusted her. Fast forward a bit things happen (I can't really recall at the moment) and I start saying that I want her to be nice, more mannerly, and respectful towards me and her family (she has been diagnosed with bpd im sure it stems from her childhood as she had shitty parents at the time which didn't change whenever her dad abused her at her grandma's house after she got custody however at the same time her grandad would give her anything she wanted regardless of if one grandma objected, by now she's been through absolute hell while still getting spoiled) now she swears at her parents and grandma (grandpop passed before we met) and it burns me up because her mom has since come back into her life as a positive figure and her grandma has always and continues to support her and she can treat them like absolute dirt and always continue to demand things and pitch a fit when something is up to her standards (I'm talking like profusely crying, saying no one cares about her, that she should just disappear etc.) 

Now to me as of a while we've been arguing over lots of things. First she told me she wanted me to impregnate her at 18 I tell her no that ""we have no jobs, no income, we are going to school, and that we would have no way to care for this baby ourselves and I don't want to bring a kid into the world whenever we are both trying to pursue higher education"" she didn't seem to care ready to put the burden of care on her mom and grandma (both work) and my family (both 48 state truckers) and she also does this with her 4 pets with her family, I also feel she only wants the baby as a status symbol and something to deal with when she wants to and to top it off ""all the other seniors are having babies"".

Second after I finally squashed baby fever she decided she wanted the pocket fence and marriage right now. She kept on saying she loves me so much and that ""I must not care about her feelings"" and that ""I'm an asshole and that I don't care about her at all"" after I said we are too young to be getting married (on top of only dating for a few months now on this try) and I also said it is not in our best interest to get married bc she just got accepted to college and will be in a sorority and that she may change her mind, (I'm doing online courses at home) she's gonna be an hour and 10 minutes away from me. And again I feel it's for vanity because she also said ""all my classmates are getting married and posting their rings on insta"" I squash it not giving her a time as to when I would wanna propose.

This upsets her and she starts telling me that we are getting married and living together in a year even though i don't know what's gonna be happening in a year but I say "" if you can settle down, be mannerly, learn respect and decency then we will get the ball rolling. Now she keeps mentioning it over and over. Then I get invited into the truck with my parents for a month to see the country and ""I don't care about her for doing that"" will elaborate more on a few sentences. Before I left I had my senior ring on my car keys, the night before I leave she takes my ring puts it on and refused to take it off because ""I'm abandoning her and wants something to remember me by"" I try getting it a couple more times but give in bc I don't wanna make her cry more before I leave and so far I've been regretting it. Also while I'm on the trip in the truck she snapchats me saying ""we are engaged"" I say "" how, I didnt propose"" then she says ""yes you did"" with a picture of my senior ring on her ring finger. I again say ""no we aren't"" to which she sent a streak photo (I believe to just me now) that says ""he proposed"" with the ring on her finger, this pisses me off and I reply "" I will break up with you over this, I love you, but you aren't pressuring me into an engagement"" to which she says ""it was a joke asshole"" and got mad at me.

Everyday since I the first day I left she says ""I need to come back because she misses me"" of course I say no bc I can't stop my parents from making money which pays our bills just bc she wants me back, and I thought she would stop but she's been offering to buy me plane tickets in Denver, Seattle, portland, salt lake City and now somewhere in Montana so I can come home to her. That's a huge waste of money (that I absolutely know she will try to make her gma foot the bill for) and since I said no ""I'm an asshole"" I don't care about her or her well being"" and that I don't love her. I'm getting absolutely tired of it, it's the same shit different day and it's only been a week since I left. And before I told her I was going to leave 2 weeks after I got back to go to spend time with my friend who is graduating basic training, she said she was going to get a ""male cuddlebuddy"" she can't exactly defend herself while her foot is messed up I told her she could get hurt and she says""I don't care"" so I said no and again I'm an asshole who doesn't care.

Fast forward to whenever I told her that I'm going to attend my friends graduation and spend 5days with, she absolutely explodes saying that again I don't care about her and I'm an inconsiderate asshole, and then says she's going to visit other dudes (whom she's been sexual with before) and that she's going ""the club"" to get drunk and get hit on bc ""I don't care about her"". I'm at my wit's end and I don't know what to do because I really love her and she's also my first sexual partner. Can she ever change? I don't know what to do.",2019-07-08 02:51:49,4,2,relationship_advice

718,cafjt6,fusthrowaway362617,Girlfriend doesn't know how to orgasm during sex. How to help fix a dying bedroom?,"Firstly, my girlfriend and I have been together for not even a year yet and sex with us is becoming few and far apart. We've both had things that got in the way of having a fun sex life, mine physical, hers are mental (and maybe some physical). I've been able to sort out my challenges by seeking doctors which helped and previously have never had so much difficulty in the bedroom for either person. My girlfriend on the other hand has never orgasmed during sex (not just with me, but any of her other partners too -- she DOES orgasm with masturbation by herself) and I'm pretty sure it has to do with the fact that she experienced significant trauma a few years ago that is making it very hard for her to (subconsciously) relax. I've discussed this many, many times with her that we should try and figure out how to make sex more appealing for you, even though she says just because she doesn't orgasm that she still enjoys sex. We've discussed her going to therapy, something she's very against, we've tried to include sex toys, more foreplay, etc. But there seems to either not be a desire to try. 

Everytime we have sex, it's almost always me initiating it. Sometimes she will even say things like ""if you order me a pizza, I'll have sex"", which she is 100% serious... or they'll be times where we're going to have sex and she immediately puts herself in a position for penetration, almost like it's a chore for her and for me to just get it done with. 

They'll also be times where I'll bring up that Im in the mood for sex as we haven't had sex in x amount of weeks and she'll say something like so I haven't orgasmed in x amount of years... 

I don't know what I'm doing wrong, I've tried to have us work together to help her figure how to make her orgasm and I've always made an effort for her to try and orgasm before I do (clit, fingering, oral, etc, and she usually tells me I'm doing a good job) before she tells me that she wants penetration-- so I don't think I'm a selfish lover, but she just doesn't seem to care to try and resolve this.",2019-07-08 02:50:46,5,1,relationship_advice
719,cafjpi,nega-psychic,"How to get over an older girl who I have no chance with, and who hasn‚Äôt really reciprocated?"," I‚Äôm a 16M. I live in the USA. I have had a crush on this girl, 19F, for the majority of my teenage years. For a few months, my crush evolved into a giant mess and it was all I ever thought about. It got really out of hand, and it pretty much dominated my life. I‚Äôm really ashamed of those couple of months, because I did some stupid stuff that probably screwed me out of a relationship with this girl, if I even had a chance to begin with. 

 I realized in these past couple of months how little of a chance I have with this girl, and I came here to try and get some advice for ways to get over her. I have struggled with this for the past few months, and I can‚Äôt find a way to break out of it. 

 First of all, the biggest red flag. She is an adult, I‚Äôm still a minor. I don‚Äôt really have a problem with the almost 3 year age gap, but in some friendly conversations, she has made it clear she wants to date guys who are older. I‚Äôm perfectly fine with this, I understand why she would. 

 Second big red flag is another guy. This other guy is a really awesome guy. I like him, and I think they would be perfect for each other. We are acquainted, but I haven‚Äôt been around to get to know him. He is probably waiting for her to get a bit older anyway. If I had to take a guess, I would say she is interested in him. 

 Finally, I‚Äôd like to explain *my* situation.  She is obviously very pretty. She works out regularly, so she has an attractive figure. She is kind, friendly, interesting, and just all-around a wonderful person. She is a quiet non-talkative person. (I am too, but mostly because of social anxiety, she just doesn‚Äôt talk much.) I‚Äôm explaining this because It‚Äôs very hard for me to not be attracted to that kind of a person. I do find her very attractive. 

 I want to clear out my feelings because I am going to college this semester, and I don‚Äôt want to miss out on a potential relationship because of previous obligations. I want to build a healthy long-lasting relationship with a girl who is interested in me. Only problem is, our two families are very close friends. We hang around with each other multiple times a week, and the frequency at which we see each other is going up because I‚Äôm going to college. I like her friendship and want to see her succeed and find happiness.

 I have a crush on her, but I also like her as a friend. I want to stay friends with her because she is an awesome person. I want to hang out with her and her siblings, and continue to have them in my life. I don‚Äôt want to completely cut her out in an attempt to kill all my romantic feelings. 

How do I move on from this? What if she really was interested in me the whole time and I find some girl at my college? She has some two older sisters and a younger sister (all older than me) what if I end up with someone else but they were waiting for me to do something and I let them, and both my families down? Am I being naive? I need someone to just tell it to me straight. I am way too young to be making sense of this whole situation. I have no idea what to do from here.",2019-07-08 02:50:31,0,2,relationship_advice

721,cafja6,NewRecord3,"The older we get, the more my wife (36F) and I (35M) don‚Äôt fit in with anyone. What can we do?","My wife and I have been married around thirteen years now.  While our relationship hasn‚Äôt changed much at all other than improving with time, and while we haven‚Äôt changed a lot over time either, it seems to us as if some of the people around us have changed.

In years past, it seemed like our main friends that we see most of the time as well as some other friends we don‚Äôt see as much as we‚Äôd like all accepted us as equals and included us in fun things whenever they could.  However, in the past few years it has felt like things have changed a bit.

Recently it feels like we‚Äôre a bit out of the loop or outcasts to an extent because of our situation.  It feels like we don‚Äôt really fit in anymore with the other married couples because they‚Äôve had kids and we haven‚Äôt.  We also seem to not fit in that well with friends who are still single because they‚Äôre dating around.

Of course I realize that time changes and people change with it.  Friends can often come and go, that‚Äôs just life.  But in these same recent years we‚Äôve had a harder time meeting new friends because the older we get, the more we realize we‚Äôre kind of on our own in our particular situation.  There just seem to be no other couples in their thirties with no kids.

This, plus it just feels like we‚Äôre left out of so much.  Married couples we know seem to spend all of their time on their kids or their careers.  That‚Äôs fine, but we can‚Äôt really relate and are typically left out.  The same goes with the single crowd who is always being flirty and playful with one another, while we just feel like ancient potatoes who are unattractive and unwanted.  Anytime we try to be flirty or play along in that count, we‚Äôre suddenly treated as if we‚Äôre gross and that sucks.  It‚Äôs almost as if our age or uniqueness counts against us.

My brother has ADD, anxiety, and depression. This makes him a very irritable person and really impulsive. He's also off his meds, and even my mom and I agree that he's extremely rude all the time. 

He doesn't shower, brush his teeth, wash his hands, and is pretty much a hermit. He doesn't leave the house and has really poor posture. He hasn't really had many friends in his life because of anxiety so I guess the combined stress of all that makes him take it out on me. Keep in mind I do have better hygiene and a (somewhat) better social life than him so I can see why he's angry.

Whenever I eat something, he says that I only eat and that I'm fat. Whenever I play video games he gets angry because ""i'm not doing enough"". I'm Christian, so whenever I refuse to work on Saturday, he says I'm ""pathetic."" 

I try my hardest to ignore what he says but it does get through to me sometimes, and I start crying and get really mad. Throughout all of this, my mom refuses to intervene. She says she ""can't do anything about it"" and ""it's your job to figure this out. You're a grown man.""

724,cafirs,Barryzechoppa,"M27 - Cheated on GF of 1.5years, broke up, she wants to get back together but I don't. We see each other see sexually but I want to stop but can't. Help.","Hello. A brief description of our relationship: I met her when I was 25 and she was 20. I liked her cause she was out of my league (I later found out that that doesn't make sense, she wasn't ""out of my league"" by any means). Immediately from the start of the relationship I began to hide parts of me that I knew she wouldn't like, like some of the music I like and some of the type of entertainment I like. Regardless, I start dating her after I was persistent. I see our relationship in (3) 6-month increments. The first 6 months was great. We had so much fun and enjoyed ourselves. I gave a lot of time and effort to her. I devoted too much time to her and made her the center of my life. We slept together around the end of the 6 months. That is important, because the type of people we are, we don't sleep around. I had previously a few times, but I did not tell her this, and lied when she asked me. She told me she was a virgin (which I believe).

  


The next 6 months, the issues arose. Here, it was medium quality relationship. We had arguments. We were out of the honeymoon phase and things started to get worse but we stilled loved eachother and I still devoted my time, effort, money, and myself to her. Every piece of me I devoted to her, I saw as an investment in the future. I believed I would marry her.

  


The 3rd 6-month period was rough. This is when the relationship started to take a downward dive. We began arguing a lot and I saw she would make no effort to fix the arguments, but rather just wanted to be mean to me. She was horrible to me sometimes... She didn't trust me and we had lots of arguments. She yelled at me in public twice. She didn't appreciate me. I still cared about her but the relationship truly started to decline. We nearly broke up during an argument we had but decided to stick together to try to make it work.

  


Finally, I did the worst thing to anyone I've ever done. I don't have an excuse for what I did, and I know I'm a scumbag. I know many things I could have done differently. I was on vacation for a week away from her and during this time, I began talking to another woman online. I told her I didn't have a gf and we talked for 3-4 days. During that time, the nature of our conversations and video chatting was sexual, but I never met her, touched her, got coffee with her. Nothing. It was purely ""virtual"" if you will. After some time, I felt bad about this and stopped talking to her. After 3 days of not talking to her, I came back from my trip and messaged her a message something like ""I really like you, but I'm sorry, I have a girlfriend. I can't continue doing this until I fix the issues on my side."" Well, that was a mistake. She didn't reply, and instead found my Facebook, found my girlfriend, and messaged her and told her everything we did.

  


So this was a pivotal point. The woman told my GF that I had slept with women before and what we did. My GF naturally broke up with me. To me... This was kind of a good thing. I wanted to break up with her but I felt I couldn't. Thats a whole different story. I know I should have had the balls to break up with her, but I felt trapped, I didn't want to hurt her, more reasons beyond that. I know what I did was not good. I know I'm a scumbag. I don't deny that. No one deserves that. Regardless, we broke up.

  


So life should continue and all should work out, right? Well, no. A month and a half after we broke up, we met up to talk, and ended up getting sexual in the car. A month later, the same happened. 2 months later we were in a hotel room. Not dating, not seeing each other, but looking for each other sexually. Recently about 2-3 months ago, she told me she wants to get back together with me and she forgave me. I didn't want to. I said I don't know if I can go back to her after what happened. I told her I need to work on myself too. Both are true.

  


Now here's my predicament. After a month of me being away from her, not talking to her, I get this deep desire to see her, and to get sexual with her. I don't want to just go sleep with other women to get over her. I have been talking to other women casually, and I've found some women worth continuing but haven't found someone worth dating yet. I don't know what to do. I know that I don't want to get back together with her, but it's that damn aching feeling you get at 12AM in your bed at night, looking at Instagram, wondering if she posted a picture on her story. Did she post? Oh she did. I should message her. And then it's all downhill from there. I'm at that 1ish month again of no talking and it's hitting me again. This time I blacklisted her texts (I don't see when she texts me but I can unblacklist her to see if she texted me in that time), and uninstalled my Snapchat to avoid that. The only way to contact her is via IG.

  


I don't know what to do. I can't get her out of my mind. It's so annoying. Any suggestions? Is there any good ways to mentally get over this?

  


Thanks for listening.

So...Ex gf‚Äôs mom left $900  in an envelope in my car and told me I could pay it back any time. I was very hesitant to take the $$$ but eventually obliged. Ex used some of ‚Äúmy‚Äù gift from her mom to pay for furnishings for our brand new apartment. Ex used it to buy a mattress, more specifically, that she used to cheat on me with. I broke up with ex and still wonder how much $$$ i actually owe the ex gf‚Äôs mom. No written or oral agreement ever happened. How much do I owe her?

More elaborated version.. 

To be clear, I never wanted to take any money from my ex‚Äôs mom. I was very uncomfortable with the fact and refused several times, before finally my ex took the cash in the envelope and physically left it in my car. Hesitantly, I used around $600 to pay off bills and a credit card. Then, since I was starting to move in with my ex, we used the other $300 in cash to buy apartment decorations and a brand new mattress. Not even a week later, my ex cheated on me in our brand new apartment and ON the same mattress we had just picked out.

I moved out and left my ex. The new mattress and apartment decorations were also left behind. I know I used my ex‚Äôs mom‚Äôs $600...but I don‚Äôt think I should pay her back the other $300.

Also...there‚Äôs no way the ex gf‚Äôs mom could ever track me down. Would there be any legal consequences if I never ended up paying her the money back? Is that even moral?


Honestly, I‚Äôd like to pay her back eventually...but I‚Äôm very bitter because I did NOT want to borrow money and repeatedly told them no before being pressured to take it and ‚Äúsave‚Äù our relationship.",2019-07-08 02:47:44,2,1,relationship_advice

Which I‚Äôm okay with. But during occasional times she would say words like, can you lend me some money? I‚Äôll pay you back. Started small like $100 for dry cleaning for interview clothes, $300 for contacts for interest preparedness, $1000 to buy yeezy shoes online for resale cause I know they will sell (which didn‚Äôt), $700 for something unknown, never mentioned, $2500 because she has no more money in her bank account. $500 more just to be safe. This was over a span of 4-6 weeks. There is more but under 100 I‚Äôll just skip. 
I remember these because I didn‚Äôt intend on spending these money, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm anything close to being cheap. Many would disagree with me. But many will agree. 

I‚Äôm from Michigan and she‚Äôs from New York. I think in her mindset deep down she just looks down on people who doesn‚Äôt know fashion or luxury living the life etc. before meeting her idol what yeezy were or supreme, never heard of it. 
I drive a Honda CR-V and she thinks it‚Äôs ugly. 
So recently I got hit in a auto accident. Insurance claims me not at fault. I was hit. The car was totaled. I‚Äôm fine. No injury thanks for asking. Getting a new car. Planning on getting Acura RDX. She hates it and gives me many insult comments like it‚Äôs a bad car. And that it‚Äôs cheap. 
So I went for a Lexus. 2020 RX 450h F Sport. Thought she‚Äôll be happier finally when the night before she says things like. You‚Äôre gonna pay that much for a ‚ÄúLexus‚Äù in a very insulting and negative way. More like not intentionally meant towards me I think. But very insulting. Wanted me to get a Mercedes. 
After careful consideration. And other friends advice. I plan on not listening to what she thinks on the car. I‚Äôm gonna get the Acura which is 22k cheaper. 

So I‚Äôm not exactly happy in this relationship, but at the same time I am. I just feel like she‚Äôs trying to change me into a New Yorker. Change me into someone more fashionable and be more of a appearance person when I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm not super old school I don‚Äôt think but to her she is. I feel suffocating at times. 

Reasons why I can‚Äôt or feel like I shouldn‚Äôt break up. She, at times deeply loves me and let‚Äôs me do whatever crazy sexual things I want. 
She does care for me when I meet her ‚Äústandards‚Äù. She recently had a miscarriage with my baby. 

I don‚Äôt want to change so much, I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt be with someone that can‚Äôt like me for who I am and respect that I work hard in making my money and spend them accordingly so it isn‚Äôt spent on random and useless stuff. 

During the recent car crash, she made me get 2 rental cars back to back just so she can have her planned July 4th bbq. Which cost me around $800. Then food and equipment and everything about $1500 more. Went from 1-2 week of planning dropped to 1 day due to car crash  and hospital visits. 

I should break up right?",2019-07-08 02:45:05,3,1,relationship_advice

I got super drunk and ended up at a party with a bunch of older guys and a few girls and long story short I ended up going back to a guy‚Äôs house and sleeping with him. We had sex twice. 
I feel disgusting this morning. I feel like I broke my own heart.

Is this a sign that we should break up? I‚Äôve been seriously doubting our relationship for the last few weeks...

731,cafgs5,TDB003,Husband catches brother in law (his sister‚Äôs husband- who also happens to be his childhood best friend) being a peeping Tom,"So. Going to try to make this as short as possible. We go to visit my husband‚Äôs family every so often. We usually stay w his sister &amp; her husband bc his mom is getting older &amp; our kids are wild &amp; like to play w their cousins (his sister‚Äôs kids). So it‚Äôs just easier to stay w them. They‚Äôre also very accommodating &amp; we have a blast w them. I mean my husband was/is childhood best friends w his sister‚Äôs husband . Anyways. During the holidays (happened last year) w decided to go and see his family. As usual, we stay w his sister &amp; her family. They have a nice piece of property way off the road which has resulted in no blinds bc they‚Äôre so far back &amp; hidden. Well our kids are little so I always bathe them in the big tub &amp; the only big tub they have in their home is in the master bath (all other bathrooms have showers), then hop in myself &amp; bathe really quick. Soooo.... here‚Äôs where it gets interesting. When we arrived to their house my husband noticed a step ladder deal on the back porch. (Back to this in a moment). We eat, socialize, then I take the kids &amp; start the bath process. My husband stays out in main area &amp; socializes w everyone else. Brother in law disappears sometime during all of this. AND. I should include, everyone is drinking, except for me, so my husband‚Äôs narrative of where and what is a little foggy. So. I‚Äôm bathing kids, my Husband comes and gets kids, then I jump in. Well.... during my bath time my husband‚Äôs sister decides she wants to go sit out on the back porch &amp; drink her wine. My husband goes with her &amp; immediately noticed the ladder is no longer propped up on the back porch, and his sister tells him to go get brother in law so he can sit out back w them. Well.. My husband then walks in &amp; starts looking for his brother in law. No brother in law. He looks out front, no brother in law, then outside under carport &amp; finds him- brother in law is under carport AND so is the step ladder. Propped up against the far backside of carport. Master bath w WIDE OPEN WINDOWS &amp; NO BLINDS is located across backside of home directly in between carport &amp; back porch. My husband is pretty intoxicated @ this point and walks in the bathroom where I‚Äôm still taking a bath &amp; drunkenly tells me he thinks he just caught his brother in law watching me take a bath. So, yeah. . . I make him stay in bathroom w me so I can get out &amp; get dressed &amp; we leave the next morning (fake I‚Äôm sick). Also, this isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened. The last time I went there to visit I was sans my husband &amp; no one could find my brother in law (of course this all happened while I was taking a bath!) . They found him out in backyard in the trees (he said he needed a break from the chaos) but I think this was the start of it ( you can see into bathroom if you walk back far enough- into trees) &amp; he‚Äôs just become more and more brave ‚Äî hence the stepladder &amp; while my husband is there, &amp; the first time my in laws were there! I mean.. the balls! My husband is a former marine &amp; twice his size! 
To this day we haven‚Äôt said anything to either of them. I don‚Äôt want my husband‚Äôs relationship with his sister to diminish bc of her creeper husband bc I know the end result would be total radio silence on their end since he wasn‚Äôt actually ‚Äúcaught in the act‚Äù but I still think there‚Äôs a really big issue here that needs to be addressed. 
We don‚Äôt go visit any of his family anymore, and of course we get asked all the time why we don‚Äôt come down &amp; why we don‚Äôt stay w them. Bc.. get this... we‚Äôre their favorite &amp; they love us staying with them so much. Even brother in law tells his wife how much he enjoys us staying (gross) &amp; she even says, he never likes for people to stay- it‚Äôs just y‚Äôall he can tolerate (it‚Äôs sick, seriously) ! I hold my tongue and try to be as nice as possible but it‚Äôs very, very disturbing. I‚Äôve told my husband it really concerns me because I may not be the only one &amp; what if he‚Äôs taken pictures! So... all this to ask. How would you proceed?!",2019-07-08 02:42:02,3,1,relationship_advice
732,cafgl3,Noi3skill,I [24M] have a very difficult time trusting/liking women.,"Some backstory:

When I was 19 I dated this girl who was a year younger than me and she was going to be going to the same university that I went to. She lived about twenty-five minutes out of time by bike (important), but she would ask me to come over to talk with her at night outside her room after one night when I was riding my bike near her house and decided I'd leave a gift (it was just a playing card) on her car (I used to bike around my whole town for about 4-6 hours a night so being that far out wasn't unusual for me). I texted her and told her that I left a card on her car and she was surprised I made it out that far (we had been texting for a while at this point just as friends). She then asked me later if I would like to come over and talk with her under the stars, and she told me she'd leave a blanket out for me in her car for when I got there so I could lay next to her window. Well, I loved biking so I was down to hang out for a while under the stars and talk about whatever. One thing leads to another and we end up going on a few dates before we break up. It wasn't exactly a clean break as she said some nasty things about my parents and I'm pretty sure I said some hurtful things as well, but that was it.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to September:

University started back up and I was going back to school. One day, however, I got an email from housing stating that I was to meet with them in their office. So I went down and there I was met with a police officer who told me to come with him. I did and I was brought to a room where I was confronted by her and another police officer. I was questioned for a little bit and she stated that she was afraid of me (this was the first I'd ever heard of her being afraid of me), she then told the officer and I that someone who looked just like me had showed up to her house unannounced on multiple occasions over the summer. I, now feeling like I'm being personally attacked somehow, am attempting to save face by asking if she remembered when exactly she saw this person. She told the officer and I a series of dates and times, and a few of the times she listed, I told them, I was at work and had proof if they just called up the local market that I worked at over the summer. Even though she was caught lying, the officer told me that she still felt afraid of me and that I was to avoid her at all times unless she specifically requested to meet with me. I remember I even got an official university email stating this exact thing except that the email stated that she had to email me, but the officer told me that it was only if she requested to meet with me (you'll see why this matters later).

&amp;#x200B;

Another two weeks later:

I was playing video games in my dorm when I got a text message from her stating that she wanted to apologize to me and she asked me if we could meet in the lobby to which I said sure. We meet up, and she told me that it's hard to make friends and that she's having a hard time in college. She invited me to have lunch with her and so I, hungry myself, thought it would be alright to go grab a bite to eat and talk for a bit if that's what she wanted to do. So we went to the school cafeteria and talked for a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometime in late October:

I was again playing video games in my dorm in my old pajamas with a hole in the crotch when my roommate and I heard a knock at the door. He got up to answer it and told me that it was for me. I left my game to go to the door and she said she wanted to talk to me in the hall. I agreed because what's the harm, but when I sat down across the hall from her to talk (as was customary in the dorm's culture) she almost instantly leaned forward to put her hand in the hole in my pants that I had almost forgotten about up to this point (I had boxers on underneath). I was dumbfounded for a second, and nobody saw what happened but I remember alarm bells were going off in my head and I remember quickly shutting down any notion she had of going to dinner with me at the cafeteria. I went back inside my dorm to change before going for a walk.

&amp;#x200B;

The day after Valentine's Day:

She texted me again and said that she wanted to meet up because something happened and she wanted to tell someone about it. I texted her that we should meet in a public place and agreed to meet at the cafeteria. She told me that she has a new boyfriend now and that she told him that she loves him. She hesitated for a bit, but then she decided to leave and I'm just sitting there dumbfounded like ""I thought something horrible happened and you needed to confide in someone, but okay... whatever..."" and I left after I finished eating.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, shit hits the fan and my grades catch up with me. I was already on academic probation because I wasn't focusing on my studies as much as I should have, and so I was suspended from school. As anyone whose ever went from getting straight A's and B's to getting suspended knows, it's devastating and I quickly became very depressed. By the time September rolled around and it really sank in that all of my friends were still going to school and I was not, I made the irrational choice to end it all. I was planning on electrocuting myself in the bathtub because I thought it was the best chance I had of not ending up a vegetable (nowadays I don't think my reasoning on that was correct). Anyways, one of the things that was gnawing at me was that I never really understood her motives for why she did those things to me and I was curious and stupid. In my head I was thinking that it wouldn't matter since I'd be dead soon anyways. So I created a fake Facebook account and messaged her, pretending to be a secret admirer from university. We talked for a few days, and she started ""liking"" me but the things she said just made me feel sick. Still, I wanted to know what was really going on because none of it made any sense to me. Anyways, at one point she mentions me, the real me, and she says that I'm a creep and a stalker. I'm thinking this is a bad idea and I decided to shut the whole thing down right away. I stopped talking to her for a while to get my thoughts straight, but at the back of my mind I was still thinking about everything that happened to me and what she said was just the icing on the cake. That was it, I was going to do it. So, I got my things in order and cleaned up, but I thought it would be okay to let my friends know that I was going to be gone so they wouldn't be wondering what happened to me. I, unfortunately, also made the mistake of telling her as well over the fake Facebook that the guy she thought she was talking to wasn't going to be around anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I couldn't go through with it as easily as I thought and I spent the next hour crying on the bathroom floor, this was my lowest point and then the cops showed up at the door and they said they had to take me to the hospital where I was put on a seventy-two hour hold. I felt awful for what I did to my family and friends, and for what I put them through but they were there for me to lift me up and they really helped me to get some of my hope back of reapplying to school so that I could finish my degree (they missed me in their study groups because I was three years ahead on the math side of things).

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks later:

I'm again playing video games in my room (it sure seems like that's all I do) when my mom called me to come to the front door. I got up and went to the front door where I was confronted by two officers who told me that the girl had filed a restraining order against me, but that I could appeal it in civil court. She had listed the times that I was ""seen"" by her house (the times when I was working) as the main piece of evidence that I was stalking her, and she had the final messages I sent to her over the fake account along with the no contact order that the university initiated as evidence that I was harassing her. Anyways, I didn't want anything to do with her and I didn't think she had a leg to stand on since I could easily disprove the stalking because of my work schedule and she was the one who told me she wanted to be friends again, the no contact order was nullified as she had apologized to me for it over text. I just had to dig out my old phone and show the judge the evidence.

&amp;#x200B;

One month in the future:

I have to go to the pretrial, and I'm feeling pretty confident. My mom was worried, but I assured her that she didn't have a leg to stand on since I had all the evidence I needed to show that she was the one who requested to meet me and void the no contact order, and that I was at work when I was supposedly ""stalking"" her.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, the pretrial goes horribly out of my favor as the judge isn't asking any of the right questions and nobody gave me a chance to even present any of my evidence. He just asked me things like, ""were you the one who sent these text messages?"" and ""Did you visit her house at night on these dates?"". I answered honestly, but I was worried that the real trial would be like that too, and I wouldn't get a chance to present any counter-evidence since nobody questioned her no contact order.

&amp;#x200B;

The trial comes around, and, long story short, I messed up... I, at one point, raised my hand and requested to speak so that I might be able to provide some insight into why I did what I did. I tried to explain that I was just trying to treat her with the same respect that I would anyone and that I was only speaking with her because she wanted to talk to me. I told him that she voided the no contact by apologizing for doing that to me in the first place and that all of the text messages that I initiated were almost a year after she voided the contract as designated void by the university if she was the one to initiate any contact with me (or so I thought). I already had the chance during the pretrial to show that I wasn't stalking her, and I thought the fact that I had proof she lied about that was enough to show that she was willing to lie about other things as well. I told him that those text messages were really just my minds way of calling for help and that I was getting the help I needed so that I could get my life back on track. I even had my roommate testify that she knocked on my dorm to see me in person.

&amp;#x200B;

But no... he told me that the university's no contact order was, in fact, not void as the university still maintained that the no contact order was present. I was flabbergasted that he would think something like that and I didn't have the email prepared but I asked him if I could get it to which he replied that he already knew all the pertinent details and that the restraining order would be officially maintained for the next four years.

&amp;#x200B;

I reapplied to go to university so I could be in my study group with my friends again because screw her, nobody was going to keep me from living my life and if I had to not make contact with someone who was toxic for me then I was perfectly fine with that. I still had hope, but they rejected my application on the grounds that the restraining order was in effect. I tried to tell them that the reason for that was because the university had maintained the no contact order, and I tried to show them proof of this via the texts to which they directed me to the exact wording of the email which stated that she would have to email me anything in order to void the no contact order, but that no such email was ever sent or received. This was some serious bullshit and, yes, I did raise my voice and tell off the dean after he said I had no chance of going back to school there while the restraining order was in place. I told him that it makes no sense that the type of contact would matter at all under this circumstance. I'm pretty sure I even told him to go fuck himself... not my proudest moment, but I felt justified.

&amp;#x200B;

The End:

Thank you for getting to the end of my story, I know it's a lot to read but I tried to break it up into as many pieces as I can so that I could get it all out there on why I still, almost four years later, have a hard time trusting women. I've had a number of girlfriends over the years (I even tried dating guys but none of them were the one for me), but I just can't get things like this out of my head and every time I get into a fight with a girl, no matter how small, my first instinct is to immediately call the police and ask them to come mediate. I'm just so scared of someone else doing the same thing to me that I spend so much time meticulously detailing all of my interactions with people. I'm going to university again in a different city and things are going great on that front, I'm just worried that I won't be able to get past this.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: A girl got me kicked out of school for four years instead of one semester and I have a hard time trusting women now. Help please.

I was convinced she cheated(I am very insecure and am considering counseling for it at this point now), and broke it off. Afterwards she explained and essentially had a bulletproof alibi. It ended badly but not horribly. Few days later she finds out from my sister who‚Äôs apparently a rat, that I said some nasty things about my ex which I regretted the second I texted them to her. I was confiding in her, I was drunk, sad, angry and to make myself feel better about the fact that I believed she cheated(this was pre breakup the day before), and said things that were horrible but untrue. She finds out, says to go fuck myself and that I have completely crushed her in a very long text. 

Few days later I apologize, she doesn‚Äôt respond right away but a few days later at midnight she calls me in hysterics because her friend was in the er and she said I was the only person she wanted to be with. I go there, she says I cannot forgive you and we can‚Äôt just get back together, but I love you so much. She says that all night and was all over me. Eventually we go to her place and again she was all over me saying she misses me and loves me so much. 

That night crushed me because it was the best night I think we‚Äôve had in a long time, I had butterflies. Now all the feelings are back about how we just broke up. It‚Äôs been two days since that night and we haven‚Äôt spoken since and she still has all her stuff at my place.

He‚Äôs turning everyone against her; what should we do?,"My friend (19F) and her friend D (?F) are international students and decided to rent a place. So they decided to rent it with a third guy (24M) that they knew from class. Dick is very popular with both of the teachers and students, since he‚Äôs the best cinematographer student they have.
    
All three are in film school. They‚Äôre also working in the same group and he‚Äôs the leader, too. He‚Äôs also the main tenant and is chummy with the landlord.
    
At first, everything was great. Dick knew from the beginning that my friend has a long distance boyfriend, so they would joke around and hang out together. However, red flags started popping up.
    
He claims to have a Kpop ex girlfriend for 10 years, and every photo that he had of her was from her Instagram. The wedding photo he had of her was due to her marrying someone else. he claimed that they met when he wanted to kill himself since she was also going to do the same, right next to him. Furthermore, he claims to have a back surgery and did it when my friends were out of the country for a few days, but when my friend and D came back, he was cleaning the house, buying groceries, and didn‚Äôt seem like he even had a surgery. These were just many of his pathological lies.
    
At one point he wanted to place a go pro camera in the living room (he claims to have 28). Dick claims at one point (I‚Äôm not joking about this) that he went to medical school AND HAS A SCALPEL IN HIS ROOM. But that wasn‚Äôt the worst part.
    
The worst part was that he started harassing my friend into dating him. When she kept rejecting him, he went to everyone and told them that they were dating, kissing, all that. Everyone believed him. He also stumbled and broke her door, leaving a gaping hole and claimed that he did it on purpose. 
    
For the past few days, she‚Äôs been avoiding him. And Dick decided to spread rumours that she‚Äôs a bitch, that she‚Äôs avoiding him for no reason, blah blah blah. They bought that too.
    
Now the whole class hates my friend and D. He‚Äôs got the teachers and their classmates on his side. At one point when my friend and D we‚Äôre going home, a girl that‚Äôs Dick‚Äôs friend followed them back and reported everything to Dick.
    
My friend confronted him an hour ago (she was with D) and told him that she was avoiding him due to family issues. He got pissed and broke stuff in his room. And just now, a Canadian friend just accused my friend of being insensitive since Dick just had back surgery and couldn‚Äôt she have been more caring?

737,cafb04,Martin_Builder,So my best friend [17F] and I [18M] have been very close the last couple months. Somewhat to close.,"TL;DR At bottom.

The last coupe months we have been hanging out a lot more. First it was just a couple hours during the Day. Only sice the last 2-3 weeks she calls me over everyday. And when I'm with her she wants me to stay as long as possible some days it will be 3:00A.M. before I leave.

2days ago we where watching a movie together. We where sitting on a corner couch I was located in the corner with my legs stretcht on the couch and she was sitting in the middle of the couch. 20minutes into the movie she crawled between me and the backrest and began lying against me. Halfway the movie she was suspiciously silent when I looked at her I saw she was fallen asleep in my arms. 2 days later we were going to a party until late so she stayed over at my place. I didn‚Äôt have something for her to sleep on so she slept in my bed. This is a wide 2 person bed with 2 separate blankets/mattresses. When I was almost asleep (I think she thought I already slept.) She crawled against me puts my arm around her and puts her head on my chest. When I woke up she was literally hugging me. She also wants to go on a (somewhat romantic vacation) to Greece with me with just 1 bed.

Now here is the catch. My friends have asked her if I was something for her she answered with that I'm not her type. Every time someone brings it up she answers that I‚Äôm not her type or with a disgusted face. I‚Äôm scared that my confession of love will damage our friendship.

738,cafadu,skylinepk,How to not get hurt from girlfriends doubts and possible mind change?,"In my passed, I have had some bad girlfriends who cheated and other terrible things, such as my first real girlfriend ever. Therefore, I am very cautious about getting attached to someone ever since these relationships. I met a girl and we hit it off amazing, and continued to date for a little but of time. As amazing as this girl is, I was super intimidated to get attached to her for fear of getting hurt. Long story short, she decides she wants a relationship with me and commits exclusively, etc. Due to her commitment, I decide its okay to let my guard down as it is a committed thing, and start to get attached. Things are going great for a month or 2, talking about things down the road, and randomly she has a complete personality change, says she doesn‚Äôt know, is thinking about everything, needs time, the usual bs.
Here I am expecting a conversation where she is going to dump me. How do I not get hurt after allowing myself to get attached to her?
I know everyone is entitled to do whatever they want, but I think its a little messed up to commit someone, after asking if its what they really want, to then bail very quickly after.",2019-07-08 02:24:07,1,2,relationship_advice
739,cafa72,redrusttusk,I (19F) miss my old best friend (19F); How do I approach her?,"Hi everyone!!

&amp;#x200B;

**Backstory (feel free to skip)**: I met my best friend (We'll call her Cici) in middle school. We were thick as thieves, and even after I moved and changed school districts, we still always hung out and were like sisters. During around sophomore year of high school, we both suffered from severe mental illnesses and broken families and so we, naturally, went our own ways. Cici and I would talk every now and again, promising to meet up and rekindle our friendship, but it never worked out. I suffer from BPD, bipolar (unspecified), anxiety and dysthymia, so I was a HOT mess. As time went on, I've lost most of my female friends for a variety of reasons (usually my fault), including Cici. 

**Last September**, she asked me to draw a portrait of her and her boyfriend. At the time, I was dealing with the worst of my mental illnesses without medication or any help, while moving out and dropping out of college, so my mental state was awful. Unfortunately, I treated Cici terribly, promising to do the portrait, but then blocking her weeks later as I couldn't accomplish it and I isolated myself. I should of said no, but I was immature and irresponsible, especially because the portrait was a gift to said boyfriend.

 Since April, I've become medicated, I go to therapy, and I've gotten a full time job and I'm living in a very stable household.  My therapist recommends I seek female friendships, and I long for the friendship Cici and I had. I only have two male friends and my boyfriend, so there is a hole in my heart for a bff. I know that people change, especially from middle school, but I at least want to make amends, even if she denies my friendship.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is: how do I mend this friendship? I'm thinking of  messaging her apologizing for my behavior and offering to take her out to eat somewhere and catch up. I do not want to make myself out as the victim, or be manipulative, so I don't know how to word it. I just miss her.

740,cafa69,Anonecho,I don‚Äôt think my marriage is going to last. Should I feel this way?,"I (20F) have been married to my husband (22M) for 2 years. We also have an infant. My husband is very private. For example, He was taking a personality quiz (which triggered this post) and I looked to read the questions  and he got very defensive, telling me to stop looking at his answers. When I asked why, he responded ‚Äúbecause you didn‚Äôt let me see yours‚Äù...I didn‚Äôt even take the quiz. He uses the privacy browser on safari. When I ask him to share things with me, he‚Äôll tell me he won‚Äôt share things with me until I share with him first. He didn‚Äôt even want to put me on his life insurance until I showed him that I put him on mine and I don‚Äôt even think he changed it because I would‚Äôve gotten a letter in the mail stating that there was a change. I plan on changing mine to where my daughter receives everything. We have two completely different views when it comes to financial and occupational stability. I have my future set. I‚Äôm working on my second degree, I have certifications, a side hustle, etc. and he doesn‚Äôt care to go to school, he doesn‚Äôt know what he wants to do when he gets out of the military (in less than a year), he has no drive/motivation and no hobbies other than being at home playing his video games. I want to travel, he doesn‚Äôt care for it. I want to invest in our money, he doesn‚Äôt care for it. He acts like he doesn‚Äôt trust me. He looks over at my screen whenever I‚Äôm doing something, I‚Äôll ask him to pass me my phone and he has to look at it first. But then he deletes his messages, emails and no telling what else. He wouldn‚Äôt tell me the correct password to his computer. When he was typing in his iCloud password, he would check to see if I was looking over his shoulder. While I was pregnant, he questioned the paternity of our daughter when I‚Äôve never cheated on him. He said it‚Äôs because the ultrasound didn‚Äôt look like him. Because he had doubts about our daughter being his, he planned to cheat on me with women/escorts that he met online until I caught him about an hour before he was supposed to meet with one at a hotel. He‚Äôs also lied to me about things big and small.

I love him and want to be with him because he takes great care of our family. He helps around the house, when I ask. He‚Äôs sweet to me. I know he truly loves me. Whatever I ask of him, he does. He loves our daughter and takes amazing care of her. He has a sense of humor and he has a soft side. He can be a great man. 

I feel like us being young could also have a lot to do with it. I want to say that things will change/become better overtime. The secretiveness, lying, deleting things, sneakiness, etc.

I met her in December of 2018, and we both caught a vibe, we started off as just friends but I clearly saw what we both wanted and so did her best friend (at the time). He best friend was like ""He's mentally unstable, he doesn't deserve someone who is as strong as you"", ""He's a kid who says he has a dream to leave behind his family and get out of the hood, who even talks like that"" So Crystal blocks me on everything and I move on cause I didn't get myself in to deep. 

&amp;#x200B;

Jump to February 2019, I get a call from her, I picked up. She said how she felt and she said I'm someone unique because I'm sensitive and actually care about people and how they feel. So we started to date and well we kicked it off. At one point me and my ex had a fallout because of my abusive ex popping up again but otherwise we were great. The passion, the connection, the sex, literally everything was great minus a little bit of communication otherwise we are literally the movie couple. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now Jump to May 25th 2019, and she calls and then says I'm sorry Mike I'm done. And then she blocked me on everything and I tried everything and anything to get ahold of her. Whether it be using a no caller id making a new social I wanted and felt I DESERVED an explanation to why she left.

&amp;#x200B;

 Jump to July 5th and my abusive ex calls cause she's out of state and Cali had those earthquakes and I live in Cali so she called to check on me then told me things that my good ex was supposedly doing, so I called from a no caller id on the 6th, I was blocked and left a voicemail saying how I was disgusted that she would do that after a breakup. She called within minutes of leaving that voicemail saying how my abusive ex lied to me and she did it just to get at her. So after that we talked for like 4 hours, she ended up unblocking me and telling me that she left because I was manipulative and isolated her. She even noted that she knew I wasn't aware I was doing it. Im just really clingy but at the end of the call I said I love you still and she said I don't anymore.; That broke my soul, I almost went into a full panic attack. She then said ""the feelings will most likely come back, just give me two weeks."" Should I give her the two weeks or bite the bullet and cut her off. I still deeply love this girl, and I know for a fact her feelings will come back, I just feel that I will fuck up again and lose her for good.

But I also don‚Äôt want to put that label on him right off the bat. 

Pretty much some of the characteristics I have noticed are blame shifting, gas lighting, and outbursts of anger. 

An example of something that has gone on throughout our relationship would be that he has said to me that he does not care about my feelings and that they don‚Äôt matter and I should just change them if I want to fix things between us when we are in a fight. If I say something that he doesn‚Äôt particularly like he may stick onto that comment until I correct it to something that doesn‚Äôt portray him as an asshole or his wrong doing. Which I usually do. And if I don‚Äôt and hold my ground it will turn into a big blow out with alot of yelling and threats.

746,caf5sk,thetinybirb,"(19 F )with trust issues, in first real relationship (19M) of over 2 years now, how do I help myself?","For some context on why I have trust issues...My mom and dad got divorced when I was 4 because my dad cheated on my mom and got the woman pregnant. They had been married for ten years at that point. Growing up, I lived with my mom but all her relationships are pretty rocky from broken trust. Not only was that my environment but she even tells me to this day that men just want sex, porn, whores...etc etc etc. Needless to say I don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôve grown up in the best environment, long story short, stopped making contact with my dad almost 3 years ago now and mom picks fights with me frequently (sorta unrelated I realize). 

Fast forward to today, I have a great healthy relationship with this great person whom I couldn‚Äôt even imagine being better than they already are. I am really ready for the long haul with this person (we‚Äôve discussed it). But every time he goes out with his friends like he is right now, and I‚Äôm at home I feel paralyzed by these thoughts that he‚Äôs thinking of or talking about or going to see someone else. I get so lost in my overthinking that I really make myself very sad. We‚Äôve talked about it but even when he reassures me, my mind doesn‚Äôt fully let me rest with the truth. Deep down I know this is irrational but it happens every time. I feel though that I‚Äôve even had this sort of jealousy or even mindset with just friends, like they‚Äôre backstabbing me when I‚Äôm not with them even if that‚Äôs not true.  

If anyone has had similar issues is there anything I can do? Being insecure doesn‚Äôt help my thoughts either but I‚Äôm making progress on myself, I just can never seem to shake these bad thoughts though. 

I feel stupid sometimes for having these trust issues when I‚Äôve never personally been cheated on but I‚Äôm just afraid. 

I‚Äôd love to hear what you have to say though. Thank you!

747,caf5rh,LiteratureQueen,I‚Äôm (18F) starting to relapse into my depression. My bf (19m) is supportive usually but I don‚Äôt know if I should tell him.,"I want to because, right now, I know I need the support. It‚Äôs hard to go through stuff like this alone. But I don‚Äôt know if I should or not.

Me and him have been together for about 4 months and we were friends for about a month beforehand. I think we‚Äôre pretty close and I try to be open about my feelings, same with him.  However, recently, things have kind of changed.

We go to the same college so the first 3 months of our relationship we were able to talk pretty often. The last month has been much different. We both went home (san diego for me, Sacramento for him). He was home for a week and we‚Äôd talk and text a little but he just never seemed interested. Then he went on an international trip and we couldn‚Äôt talk for two weeks because he didn‚Äôt want to spend too much money on his phone bill (understandable). 

It‚Äôs just that, since he‚Äôs gotten back (which has only been 3 days to be fair), he doesn‚Äôt seem at all willing to put in the work to text/talk to me. I had been thinking about us going on a picnic today and asked him about it when he first got back (Friday) but he said he‚Äôd probably be busy. Okay, I get it, he‚Äôs living with his sister for right now and he starts a new job tomorrow (Monday). Then, today (Sunday), I checked to see if he was busy and he said no. I was super excited and found out one of our friends was in town so we could do something alone then meet up with them. 

Then I get the text ‚Äúhey *my real name* I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm gonna go‚Äù. For one, he rarely uses my real name. Two, that terrifies me. I know it‚Äôs my dumb anxiety ridden brain but being rejected to hang after almost 3 weeks of no contact hurts my confidence in his feelings for me...

I asked him why and he just says that he‚Äôs got a lot on his mind (not helping the idea that he doesn‚Äôt want me anymore) and he has work tomorrow. That wasn‚Äôt an issue before but I try to be understanding. I tell him I won‚Äôt bother him anymore and goodluck on the job. He justs sends ‚Äúthanks‚Äù.

I know it‚Äôs probably me overreacting because I‚Äôm slipping emotionally but I don‚Äôt know if I should bring up my issues with myself and us or keep it to myself.

748,caf4tl,throwaway59283768,I'm (25/m) worried about my boyfriend's (25/m) weight and health,"My boyfriend and I are moving in together after about a year of dating. We're extremely happy and compatible, and we love one another dearly. However, I'm starting to worry about his health. I am naturally skinny, which I guess makes me lucky, but I was also raised by parents who were really tough about eating healthy food and eating in moderation. My boyfriend was overweight for most of his life, but about a year before we met, he slimmed down. He's still technically overweight I would say, but it's not like he's 300 pounds.

I know that his weight has (and does) affect his self esteem, so I'm *very* hesitant to ever mention anything within this realm. I don't want him to think that it's about aesthetics for me, because I truly love him so much and am fully attracted to him the way he is. However, he has gained a noticeable amount of weight in the past few months, and it's difficult for me to watch him eat chicken fingers and ice cream all the time while this is happening.

I don't want to micro-manage his diet or life choices. I love to eat unhealthy food once in a while, obviously, and I want to be able to do this with him, but it makes me upset when he wants to order unhealthy food all the time and he's overweight. It's hard for me to imagine even being slightly overweight and continuing to eat unhealthy food. We always talk about marriage and having children and our future lives together, and I don't want to constantly be worrying about my husband's health. I want him to take care of himself.

It's such a delicate situation. I try to just lead by example, and encourage him to be healthy as much as possible, but it's hard for me to not also be annoyed when he breaks a healthy streak. He belongs to a very expensive gym and does work out occasionally, and he does eat healthy food a lot of the time, but he'll only keep it up for half a day at most and then will reward himself by eating ice cream or something else like that. It's *not* sustainable and clearly it's not working for him. I don't know how to help him without pushing him in the other direction.

**TLDR: I want my bf to get serious about maintaining a healthy weight and overall healthy lifestyle, but I don't know how to go about this in a way that is effective and won't hurt his feelings.**",2019-07-08 02:08:26,4,0,relationship_advice

However, I discovered that she is planning a c-section or medicated birth for herself. I am not against this at all, everyone has a right to decide how to give birth. I had a natural birth with a doula and my husband present in a hospital. It was the most empowering experience for me and I feel like I can climb mountains after that experience. I chose this route as I educated myself in the impact of pitocin (synthetic oxytocin) on your own natural hormone production and the latching process during breast feeding. As well as the impact it has on causing harder more unproductive and unnatural contractions that has led to an increase in C-section rate from 6-9% up to 30-40% within the US. I am personally friends with a few maternal-fetal medicine physicians and have heard from them about how the use of medication is often just a matter of convenience rather than necessity.

Anyway, all this being said, I don‚Äôt know if I should share with her some of the scientific resources I read to better guide her decision? Should I just leave it be? I love my sister dearly and would feel like a bad person not to share, but I also don‚Äôt want to overstep.

755,caf257,womblemeep,Worried girlfriend will leave me if she knew about my sexuality.,"Hey everyone, this is a really hard post for me to make, since I've never spoke about this to anyone, but right now I'm really stressed out and I need some advice and somewhere to vent.

I consider myself a straight guy for the most part. I've always dated women and always found women sexually attractive. I've never wanted to date a guy and I've never seen a guy I thought was handsome or been necessarily attracted to. But, when I get turned on, I have gay fantasies. Whenever I get turned on, I imagine men or women, depending on my ""mood"". And Ive watched gay and straight porn. Though after I ejaculate, men become disgusting and am I still attracted to women, but when I am aroused, I feel as if I could possibly have sex with a guy, but I'm not really sure. I think it's mainly just me being aroused, but I dont really know. But like I said, after I ejaculate, men are disgusting to me and I couldn't imagine ever having sex or kissing or being a relationship with a man at all. I know I shouldnt use labels, but I dont know if I'm bi or straight. I've heard that straight guys having same-sex fantasies is a common thing and some straight-identifying guys watch gay porn. 

The real problem is with my girlfriend. She was raised very conservative Christian and doesnt hate gay or bi people, but I know she would be uncomfortable knowing that I've masturbated to gay porn and might possibly have sex with a guy. I obviously wouldnt since I'm with her but think hypothetically. And like I said I only consider having sex with guys when I'm turned on, never in my normal state of mind, which makes me think I may be straight since it's not in my normal thoughts, they are purely sexual arousal generated thoughts. But I'm still stressed that she would leave me if she knew this about me. I know most people would just be like ""dont tell her then"" and I dont plan to, but it still hurts that I have something that this girl I really care about might leave me for if she knew about it.

756,caf1nt,miniestlop,Me (20F) and my roommate (21F) of three years are no longer as compatible as we once were.,"I'm really not sure where to start. I (20F) met my current roommate (21F) in our freshman year of college. She was my suite-mate and we were both out-of-state students. For the first year of college, we were each other's only friends. We've been roommates since, and we currently live in a three bedroom townhome with our mutual friend (21F). My roommate and I used to get along great, but recently I've begun noticing things that bother me. 

For one, I've begun noticing how messy she is. When filling out our lease applications, we both stated that we were relatively clean people. However, I've noticed that she leaves dirty dishes on the coffee table, dinner table, and on the stove. And it's not just one or two dishes. I'll clean before going to work and when I get back, there will be dozens of dishes, cups, and mugs sitting out on the table. She doesn't rinse her dishes before putting them in the sink, so when I go to do the dishes, I put my fingers in her food. She also doesn't do the dishes. The other day, I was in the middle of emptying the dishwasher when I got called in to work. She was sitting there, watching me do them, and ended up closing the dishwasher and leaving all the dishes there. I had to rewash them because when I came back, there were dirty dishes stacked on top of the clean ones. Additionally, she uses our shared laundry room as her closet. Every time I go downstairs to wash something, her clothes are in both the dryer and the washer. And I'm talking piles and piles of clothes, on top of the dryer, in the machines, in a basket on the floor, etc. I used to do her laundry to get it out of my way. Her clothes hang dry in the laundry room for anywhere between a few days to a couple weeks before they're removed. She leaves her shoes everywhere as well. I continuously trip over her sneakers and flip flops when I come home from class or work. Anytime I ask her to pick up her shoes, or put her dirty dishes in the sink so I can wash them, she acts like I'm being ridiculous. I know she's not the cleanest, but she keeps her room in better shape than our shared space and it's beginning to bother me. 

Another thing that's been bothering me lately is how blatantly she excludes me from things. If we plan a party together, she calls it ""her party"" and asks that I clean while she's away. She'll come home, see me lounging around, and tell me that she's going to hang out with her friend. I feel it's important, for context, to mention that she met this friend through her ex boyfriend. They instantly clicked and now they do everything together. I'm happy that she has someone that she feels this close with, but I can't help but feel like she's thrown me aside for something better. And I've had this conversation with her. I've told her that I feel left out and that she doesn't want to be my friend. She said that wasn't true, that she wants all of us to be friends, but her actions have proved anything but. I'll invite her to do something, and her answer is always along the lines of ""I can't, I'm broke"" before she leaves to go shopping or drinking with her friend. If we do end up going out together, she's glued to her phone and doesn't respond to a word I say. Her boyfriend had to plan a movie night to get her to hang out with her little sister and me. She's even asked me to be the designated driver for an event I wasn't invited to. I would understand if she told me that she didn't want to be my friend, but she keeps telling me that we're best friends before leaving me to spend the my time alone. 

I know these are all little things, but the fact that they all happen daily is pushing me to the limit. I know I'm not imagining it, because our other roommate is moving out because of everything that's happening (and more). It's gotten to the point where I spend the night crying because I feel so helpless over the situation. I'm miserable at home and I can only be around her for short periods of time before I'm consumed with frustration. As a result, I've begun thinking that I should move out. We re-leased for another year, but I have the money available to break my contract. She wouldn't have to pay any extra rent since we're on separate leases. My grandparents have offered to let me move in with them while I finish up my final year of school, but I know I'd be giving up some of my independence if I did that. I could really use some advice. I know that the first step is to talk to my roommate, but she gets defensive anytime I bring up things that bother me. Our conversations always end with her telling me that she's going through a rough time, that she feels bad about herself, and how I shouldn't be feeling the way I am. In the end, nothing gets solved and I leave feeling worse than I started. How do I start a conversation that doesn't catch her off guard and make her defensive? Am I overreacting? Would breaking the lease even be the right thing to do?",2019-07-08 01:59:41,3,3,relationship_advice
757,caf1if,anotherchanceneeded,Update I seen my ex after 12 yesrs and want him back,"I posted here the other day. I received some very good feedback. Some say its over I had hurt him so bad not to bother him. Others say to text or write him to apologize. Thats what I did earlier this evening.

I wrote how nice it was to see him again."" I thought I would never get the chance to express how truly sorry I was on how I treated him. I would have liked to say this face to face so that he would see the depth of my sincerity. I hurt those people in my life who were trying to help. My mother, my friends and most of all you."" I said a few more things about him. I stayed away from any of the struggles I have had, as this was about him. I did not ask him to contact me, I just wanted to apologize. 

He wrote back a few minutes ago. He was also glad I was doing well. When he had pictured me in his thoughts over the years he saw me as aged by 15 years, an old drunk with 3 kids that did not know their fathers. When he saw me all put together( his words), with the hair style, the clothes, he thought I looked stunning. He said I was always pretty to him, but this caught him off guard. Then while we were talking he saw the wedding ban. He thought to himself "" I have been living a miserable life for a dozen plus years,  because of this woman. Look at the success she is having looks, career, marriage, probably a family."" ""Life has not been fair to me"". This how he ended it. 

 I feel terrible that he has had a crappy life. He said he was doing well. He kept a positive face to his life when we met up. Do I console him? Do I reinforce that I am not married or have a family?

Edit: After reading your replies I have contacted him again this morning. I told him that I was not married and do not have kids. I told him up to the last 3 years I have struggled also. I am in a better place in my life. I again asked to meet up to talk.",2019-07-08 01:59:19,18,32,relationship_advice
758,caf10p,Rellen10,"Saw my ex dating someone, feel sick to my stomach.","Hi reddit,

About one year ago my GF of 2 years broke up with me. We  were each other‚Äôs first loves, lost our virginities to each other, and had gotten really close with each others family‚Äôs. Looking back we had such a great relationship, but at the time I was just turning 21 and wasn‚Äôt appreciating her as much as I should have. Since the breakup I have graduated college and started my career. She just graduated college and started her job this summer and I always had this thought in my head that some day we might be able to make things work better.

Immediately after the breakup things were hard, but after a couple of months I moved on with my feelings and accepted being single again. I‚Äôve been shy and had a hard time dating, and deep down I never really wanted to move on from her. I tried hooking up with other girls casually, but nothing seemed to feel the void of what I had before.  

I felt that I was finally starting to accept moving on from her until yesterday I asked to see our old dog and she told me I should give her some space as she just started dating someone new. Then I saw a photo of her with another guy on the 4th of July. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. I knew this day would come, but the thought of her being with another guy just hurt me a different kind of way that I never felt before.  What can I do to make this feeling better and ultimately get past this?",2019-07-08 01:57:59,15,23,relationship_advice
759,caezyp,Biglce,"Broke up with girlfriend, then tried to get her back because I thought I made a mistake.

She declined my advances and I pursued her heavily, calling and honestly just going hard to get her back. I know this turns women off more but I was so blind that I kept going. I caught her with her babyfather and confronted her about it. Her friends have spoken to me, most of them telling me to leave her alone and give it space, many of them telling me shes not worth this stress, but that she will come back, due to her telling them that she really loves me but is afraid I'll break her heart again blah blah...

760,caezqg,JeremiahWeeeed,"My 8 year relationship recently fell apart, I was going to propose in December. What are my next steps? (30/M)","Hello to anyone reading.

As the title says, I had been in a relationship for 8 years with the woman I thought I'd spend the rest of my life with. However last month she made the difficult decision to end our relationship.

I am not looking to try and salvage what we had, I respect her decision and completely support her right to be happy and unfortunately I was unable to be the person that could do that.

Without going into much detail, I've been suffering from depression for as long as I can remember and was unable to be open with her when I was down. I was scared of letting someone in to the dark incase they couldn't find the light neither. This is no excuse. 8 years is a long time to be in a relationship with someone who closes themselves off in order to maintain a status quo level of happiness. It was not fair to her at all and it wasn't fair to me. Somewhere in the middle I lost my self worth but more importantly, she lost hers too. Sometimes being in a comfortable relationship will do this.
 I'm not looking for sympathy at all nor am I trying to change the hard facts. I didn't love myself enough and doubted her love for me because of it.



We both lived together in a foreign country for the past 4 years. Every friend I have made here is equally a friend of hers. I do not want a division in our/her group. She moved out of our apartment and will continue to live in this country but I can't physically or emotionally continue my life here. I will leave at the end of this month.

I have no idea what to do next. I've spent more or less all of my 20s in a relationship and didn't want that to change.

I don't have many people here that are real friends, most of them are at home. However at this point in life it is next to impossible to rely on these friends as they have their own lives and loves to focus on and that is completely fair.

I can't move home. I tried for a month and there is nothing there for me other than those friends and family but even at that, I did nothing but spiral into the void.

I've watched all the YouTube videos and have read all of the articles online on self acceptance and improvement but I need practical steps in order to better myself and forgive myself. I have an overwhelming guilt that this could have all been avoided.

Therapy and medication aren't an immediate option as I genuinely have no idea where I will be in two months, if even in the same county as I currently live in. Money is also a small issue as I've been paying for our apartment alone since we broke up.

I need advice on how to build a better relationship with myself before I can even begin to think about someone else if that's even an option in the future.

Again, no sympathy is necessary. I need practical advice and what options I have at the minute. I am at no risk of self harm or suicide. 

Any life advice or experience would be very helpful.

Thank you.",2019-07-08 01:54:32,2,3,relationship_advice
761,caezgd,Throwaway41698,Issues with fianc√©e and her sister today.,"Typing this on mobile

Went out to the lake today with my fianc√©e, her parents and her sister with her 1 year old daughter. Before we got to the lake. We carpooled(I,fianc√©e,sister of fianc√©e and her daughter). My fianc√©e‚Äôs sister gets agitated from her daughter‚Äôs crying and almost made us cancel the trip but we were able to convince her otherwise. In the meantime her parents got lost on the way there due to the fianc√©e‚Äôs dad being a bit hardheaded and refuses to use a gps. We get everything squared away and get to the lake. After our short fun at the lake we decided to head back to my fianc√©es parents house. They decided I should drive the way back while my fianc√©e sisters stays in the backseat with the baby so her crying can calm down a bit just in case she starts.

We follow her parents back home but Once we start driving back I notice we‚Äôre driving around in circles since I have my gps on. I tell everyone in car about this and to call the dad to tell him to just follow me. They brush it off but after 20 minutes of going in the wrong directions we pull up next to the dad and I tell my fianc√©e to tell him to just go behind me and follow us home but brushed off again. After another 10 minutes or so I see we‚Äôre about to turn and I say it‚Äôs the wrong exit. I made the turn ahead and I told everyone to call the dad and tell him to put on the gps to get back home.(idk why I did this since I kinda hesitated either going up ahead to take the right turn or just follow behind but I didn‚Äôt want to hold up traffic). After taking the right turn my fianc√©e and her sister blew up on me saying how I could leave them behind. Both screaming and cursing at me to get out the car to and just hop in the back. The sister kept saying how I was a piece of shit and telling my fianc√©e not even her ex husband could do such a thing. She said this is what you expect you from a guy who Doesn‚Äôt understand family.(her family is real close). She kept going on and on and I said to just drop it and drive. She threaten to leave me on the highway. I told her not in this car it won‚Äôt happen. I own it but it‚Äôs a gift to my fianc√©e while I‚Äôm paying it off for her. My fianc√©e said nothing the whole time and I‚Äôm considering breaking off the wedding. I told her every time there‚Äôs a issue with her sister Against me she does nothing to stop her. It took 3 years for me to just get on her sisters goodside so she can accept me. My fianc√©e does say time to time she‚Äôs just jealous of our relationship because it wasn‚Äôt anything like Hers. But after today I‚Äôm not sure anymore. I told my fianc√©e she never has my back when it comes to her sister. It‚Äôs always something with her. I told her how can I commit to You 100% when you can‚Äôt. She stayed quiet the whole time afterwards while I went to The backseat. I told my fianc√©e afterwards I‚Äôm not 100% sure on the wedding anymore.",2019-07-08 01:53:43,3,2,relationship_advice
762,caezc0,laksa-girl,My (24f) Chinese family said racist things to my Indian bf (24m). I don‚Äôt know how to make the situation better.,"We‚Äôve been together for four years. Both of us were born and bred in North America. For what it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôm the first one in my family to ever date (never mind be in a serious relationship) with someone who‚Äôs not Chinese. My family left China decades ago for higher education; they‚Äôre scientists and businessmen. His family is equally ‚Äî if anything, actually more ‚Äî ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù: all doctors or scientists at the top of their fields, and have been living in the West for even longer than my family. My family is fully aware of this. I only mention all this because they can be very status-conscious about superficial things like this (to my chagrin). So what happened over the last few days has thrown me for a huge loop.

My boyfriend and I are staying together with my family for a few weeks (everyone has previously met and hung out, but never really any quality time). They like him a lot ‚Äî they offer on their own initiative to take him out for dinner and even praise him when he‚Äôs not around! They even talk about wanting to treat his family to dinner. 

Which is why I was SHOCKED when a few days ago, my uncle (while drunk and drinking beer with my boyfriend), went on a rant about how Indian immigrants in my hometown have a bad reputation for milking government benefits and leaving their residences uninhabitable for future tenants. He even called them refugees! When my boyfriend asked what other immigrants do my uncle responded that they‚Äôre not as bad and just come here to have a better life/ education. I was incredibly angry but kept calm and respectfully changed the topic to how our own Chinese people do disrespectful things. The next day I called my uncle and told him that what he did was incredibly awkward, disrespectful and to stop ‚Äî he agreed to be more mindful in the future.

The next day, while my bf and I were talking about the rigor of PhDs in different countries with my father, my father suddenly went on a tangent about how all the Indians in his PhD program failed while all the Chinese passed ‚Äî all in a very proud tone. Again, I was shocked! On the spot, I spoke to my dad in Chinese that he shouldn‚Äôt say things like that ‚Äî mentioning that my boyfriend‚Äôs own Indian grandfather completed a highly regarded PhD program in a similar field. My dad told me in Chinese that he didn‚Äôt mean it like that, and then switched back to English (my bf can‚Äôt understand Chinese) and mumbled sorry.

To make it all even more confusing, apart from these instances, they‚Äôve gone far and beyond to genuinely treat him well. They said those things to my bf as if..... he wasn‚Äôt Indian.

Honestly, if I knew this was going to happen, I would have warned my bf or not brought him home. But the things my uncle and dad said are things they have never even discussed amongst our own family, so it‚Äôs all really thrown me for a loop. If you‚Äôre wondering where my other family members are, they‚Äôre all currently on vacation. When I called my mom to tell her what happened she was as shocked and angry as I was. 

All this happened within the short span of two days (the incident with my dad was yesterday) and has understandably caused a riff between my bf and I. I‚Äôve apologized countless times for the shameless actions of my family. I‚Äôve reiterated many times that I disagree with them and that I have immense respect for his family and his culture. He‚Äôs not angry with me and knows it‚Äôs not my fault, but I can tell he‚Äôs very sad and uncomfortable. Our interactions just aren‚Äôt the same. I keep apologizing for bringing him into this environment and telling him I love him, but I don‚Äôt know what else to do to make the situation better. It seems that the damage has already been done ‚Äî nothing will ever change his perception that my family members inherently disrespect his culture, and that they think our Chinese culture is superior. He even told me that if he‚Äôd hate to have kids whose grandparents tell them that half of their ethnic background is inferior.

Has anyone been in similar situations or has ideas on how to repair this situation?

So, Matt and I have been dating for four and a half years and I absolutely adore him. We have had our ups and downs, but mostly things are great between us. 
Until we fight. When we fight, Matt gets crazy. He is NEVER physically harmful, but he will cuss at me and scream and get super in my face. He has also purposely made me look bad in front of strangers by yelling that I‚Äôm racist (I‚Äôm not). From time to time he will also do things to make me cry intentionally. 
However, when things are good, they‚Äôre great. We talk about marriage and my family loves him, and his family loves me. 

Matt was offered an amazing job out of state, and asked me to go with him. At first, I was super excited because that was the next step I wanted with him, but the more I think about it, the worse of an idea it seems. 

To start, my parents are VERY against cohabitation because they‚Äôre quite religious. Even though I‚Äôm not, it‚Äôs been hard. Not to mention that I have siblings that are much younger than I am, and leaving them will be hard because my parents said they aren‚Äôt allowed to visit until Matt and I are married. 

Secondly, I feel like I am chasing his dream. Which, of course I don‚Äôt mind and I can finish my degree and work anywhere in the country that‚Äôs not an issue, I just feel like I‚Äôm uprooting the only life I‚Äôve ever had. 

Lastly, is it a red flag that I am feeling apprehensive about this? I overthink everything, but is this a good time to do so?


So really, I guess all I want to know is if it‚Äôs normal to question your relationship before a big step like this? Or is it bad that I‚Äôm suddenly questioning everything?

&amp;#x200B;

The title my husband immediately responded to here on reddit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've actually never wrote on reddit until he has been secretly searching for secret extravaganzas. First on craigslist, then other mobile apps like Skout. 

&amp;#x200B;

He's still young and of course, very active online with social media, blogs, sites like these. I've never really paid much attention to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two years ago, I found out he cheated. It hurt like hell. I cried. I thought, was I not attractive? too old? Did he get bored of me already? 

I love him, so I stayed, hoping it was just a mistake. Being traditional, i'm very family oriented coming from an Asian family, but I'm American-born.

but because he's in the Navy, he has to deploy. 

I found out that just a year ago when we were supposedly working on us, he has been searching for Japanese girls to sleep with (he's in Japan as of now). 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been here with my daughter, busy working, taking of the dog, the house....I forgot how to take care of myself, always putting my family first...because i was taught that's what a wife is supposed to do, to make sure everyone in the house is thriving. 

&amp;#x200B;

But what about me? 

My husband cried and said he'd never hurt me again. 

&amp;#x200B;

but i'm still hurting. 

&amp;#x200B;

i've gained weight and I don't feel so pretty. 

&amp;#x200B;

My career...i don't even know what to call it..it doesn't pay well. I'm 31 years old and my job isn't fulfilling. Because I have a young daughter, i've chosen to work remotely as an online teacher so I can take care of her and help her with school and whatnot, while my husband is away. I didn't want to leave her in daycare all the time, so I've chosen this position for a more flexible life as a working mom.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just stuck in a self-loathing state right now. I know that there are people out there with bigger problems like starvation and lacking basic survival resources.....but sometimes, I end up crawling back into this hole of depression. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some days i'd get bursts of motivation to exercise and work on myself and my goals, but then it'll last about a week...and this repetitive cycle goes on like this.  

&amp;#x200B;

I hate when he tells me ""move on from the past."" I get it, I have to move on to heal, but it still hurts so much and it did a lot of damage.

768,caew4g,DjNutCream,Girl at work thinks I'm creepy?," 

A few months back I started to become, what I thought, was friends with this girl I work with. We would talk all the time, and she quickly became one of my favorite people to work with. It seemed like she genuinely enjoyed my company as much as I enjoyed hers. But a couple weeks ago I was talking with a different co worker, and this friend came up in conversation. This other co worker just decides to casually drop ""Oh yeah, I heard that (the girl) thinks your like... creepy."" Not only that she also said (and this is honestly still hard to even think about) that she was afraid I would molest her...???????????????????????????? Like the crime that people go to jail for??????? I was completely at a lose for words, I couldn't believe it. I asked the friend who told me this why she thought this. He didn't know as he was told by the person who she told directly. So, Girl &gt; Friend 1 &gt; Friend 2 &gt; Me. At this point I'm thinking back on the last 2 months of interactions I've had with this girl trying to figure where I fucked up so bad that this person associates me, with being a molester. I've never ever done anything inappropriate, no sexual advances, jokes, I don't think we have ever even made physical contact. We did do the whole ""teasing"" flirting often enough, maybe that was it? She always seemed to be enjoying herself though. I almost thought she was into me. As far as I know I've never come across this way to anyone and am mostly a quiet person. I thought I had an actual friendship with this girl and I don't remember her once ever looking uncomfortable or upset with me or anything like that.

So I decided I was done interacting at all with this person, we've worked with each other since and I've been trying to avoid her at all cost. I don't start conversations, I don't look at her or anywhere even in her direction, I even stopped talking to her friends. But what has me confused is she is still always wanting to talk with me. She is still always starting conversations and being nice to me. Even when I try to make it seem like I don't even know she's around she'll find something to talk about. I usually carry out the conversation until she needs to leave, but I've been very careful of what I'm saying. It just doesn't make sense to me that she could be that creeped out by me, to go as far as to use the word ""molest"" but still act like everything is normal between us.

771,caevrd,McDonaldsnapkin,I [18m] am struggling with the fact that I'll be leaving my GF [17f] for the military in a few months,"I met my current girlfriend in October and things have been great between us, but I leave for the military in a few months and I'm starting to get worried about how it will effect our relationship. Even though we met in October last year I have been signed up for the military in late August of last year. I told myself I wasn't going to date my last year of HS when I was going in and I've only ever had one 4 month relationship before joining so I was pretty confident staying single would've been easy lol. Anyway fast forward to October and I quickly fell in love with my current GF. 

I made it clear in the beginning I was signed up for the military and she's always been supportive from the start and even encouraging to pursue my passions. After high school though she plans to attend college for business in state. Meanwhile I'll be stationed somewhere in America or maybe overseas. Also during her senior year of high school I'll be doing BMT in September and then go straight to school training for my job that lasts like 8 months. So that means for 10 months I'll have very little to almost no time home. Meanwhile my girlfriend will be living her senior year of high school. 

I want to join the military and I really think it's the best decision for me, but I also don't want to be away from my gf for so long. I'm excited to leave, but at the same time I'm fear this long distance won't work. I just feel like it's not realistic and if I was a senior in highschool culture it'd really suck to never have your SO around. I feel guilty. We spend a lot of time together and it's normally quality time, but we have been butting heads a little here and there lately. We never bring up or talk about me leaving really but it's a thought that scares me in the back of my head. Sometimes she briefly brings up how she will miss me when we have deep talks, but not much besides that. We both know it's something that will suck and be hard at first. Deep down, I think I'm more worried than she is but it's hard to say really. What can I do to stay positive about my future and to assure her are relationship will be long lasting? My girlfriend has always been extremely loyal, honest, and trustworthy (I trust more than just about anybody). I know she'd never cheat but I just can't help but think she'll fall out of love due to my absence. We always say that it's okay not to always see each other but we're just a bestfriend type couple so we are always around each other. So yeah, I feel like I'm leaving my best and my girlfriend. I never tell her any of these thoughts. We're pretty good at being open with each other but this topic of me leaving feels like there's a barrier between us. What should I do to open her up about the subject?

TLDR: I'm leaving for the military soon and need help being open with my girlfriend about my thoughts and worries about leaving.",2019-07-08 01:43:15,9,1,relationship_advice
772,caeu3d,StrngThngs,I (57M) am trying to approach my wife (53F) of 16 years about her weight gain...,"Yeah, I know, there is no way right? When we married, she (C) was 5'2"" and \~125, and reasonably active. I (D) thought she was attractive. Well, after our only child was born, and two miscarriages, and some tough relationship problems (I'm not all that easy to live with), she's steadily gained weight to the point she's just under 200 lbs now.  

About a year ago she came home, after a Dr's appointment, and cried telling me she was out of shape, high BP, high blood sugar, etc. and that she was really worried. She started an exercise (Crossfit) and eating healthy regimen and started to lose some weight be more importantly began to feel better about herself physically and make improvements. 

The other day I was out jogging and saw a woman about her size and a few years older painfully walking up the driveway to get the paper. You could tell her joints hurt...that LIFE hurt, and I don't want that for my wife. To complicate matters, about 5 years ago, I felt I'd gained too much, and went on a fitness (weightlifting) and diet regimen and lost \~50 lbs of fat while building about 20 lbs of muscle.  And I still work out regularly and watch what I eat.  For me now, this is a habit, but one that pisses her off as she sees me as having working out as a priority instead of doing something else she wants me to do. (I get to what she wants later tho). 

And honestly, this affects our sex life. I don't find her attractive physically now. And that impacts other areas as you can imagine.

Instead, she spends a lot of time lying down in bed playing on her iPad. And eats without any ability to restrain. I see snacks sacks hidden around the kitchen (sugary granola, chips, crackers), and every time my son has dessert if we go out, she has one also. (I've talked to my son about not ordering dessert, he forgets...) Cake on the table today after church, had to have a piece.  She does the classic ""I had something healthy for breakfast, now I can have a treat"" thing. 

But this is not a physical problem I think, it is psychological or relational. I think sometimes it is her way of putting distance, actual physical distance, between us. Sometimes I think I""m the problem; but in the end, each person is responsible for their own behavior.  But no matter what, I want her to be there later in life for our son, for us, and for herself.  Life repeats: my mother and grandmother both died of diseases that had to do with being obese and inactive, and both were miserable for their last years. I don't want to see that for C.

Edit 1: yes, after 2 months promotional membership, she stopped going to CrossFit and eating well.

No, cheating has never been an issue. But we come from two very different lifestyles and even 16 years later my approach to something is completely different than she wants. For instance she's very sensitive to what others think, I usually don't care.",2019-07-08 01:38:54,218,266,relationship_advice
773,caetrn,SqueeSpleen,I (29M) was dumped out of blue by my girlfriend (27F) and I'm looking for closure.,"Well, I am going to write a little of context.

&amp;#x200B;

I moved from my country to work and a study a master's degree. I started seeing this girl, and she started to include me on her life. I meet her friends, after 40 days of dating she asked me to be his boyfriend (A little fast to me, but we had a lot on common and we really turned on each other).

Well, the thing is that she included me on her life very fast... we hadn't dated a total of two months and her friends were saying that they never saw her so in love, and she presented me to... her uncles, aunt, grandfathers, mom, sister, brother-in-law, nephew... she even brought me to a jail to visit a friend of her family that's like a big brother to her (I think that this is a red flag, but I was comfortable with them so I went along 4 times).

Well. There was one thing... I'm working as a TA on the university, and I have arrived four months ago to the country and I still haven't been payed (but I will be payed on a month or less, apparently, this friday the last step of bureocracy before paying was fixed), so I was trying to save money and I'm renting a room in a lady's house.

&amp;#x200B;

So that, was our largest problem, we wanted to have sex but we had few opportunities as she lives with her mother. One time we even went to the backyard where the temperature was very cold.

&amp;#x200B;

She talked to me more than one time about me moving with a roommate, for obvious reasons, she even told me of a friend of her who rented a relatively cheap house. Perhaps I should have been more upfront, but until start receiving my salary I cannot afford to do that kind of thing, and I'm starting to know better my classmates so I can see if I can share room with one of them. But she and her family have way more acquisitive power than mine so there were some differences in which I felt that she didn't really understood me.

&amp;#x200B;

Both of us work and study on the university, so we hadn't a lot of free time but I always made free time when she had. Well, during the last month she brought me to every familiar even/party she found, but we had little intimancy.

And some weeks ago she traveled 300 km, and when she came back from that ity she started to be distant on whatsapp. I tried to ask her is something had happened or to see each other in person because I felt that something was wrong and I wanted to know if she had issues (more than the stress of finals and work) or what the hell was going on. Well, finally the day before my hardest final she dumped me.

&amp;#x200B;

She said that this wasn't working for her, and that the lack of time and will to see us made her realize that she didn't want to continue anymore. This was a short relationship, we dated 3 months. Oh, and she said this using whatsapp, after that she deleted me from facebook. She also said that she might give me feedback but she hadn't the time. I didn't ask her for feedback because while I know that I have things to improve, I think that asking feedback to her in this context is humilliating.

Oh, she also once said that more than 300 km away it wasn't infiedility, half joking, but this is a red flag that I didn't like (or perhaps sense of humour, is hard to tell).

&amp;#x200B;

My plan is to finish this years and after having organized my finances I want to move to another place, because there are some things of adult life that are uncomfortable when you rent a room. But even if I know it's not exactly true, I cannot stop thinking that if I were to move we might try again. And that's very self destructive to my selfsteem. Also, I was very busy so I started gym one week before she dumped me because I wasn't able to find a gym near where I live (finally I started going to a subpar gym on university). But without exercise I'm not assertive and I feel like a project a lot of insecurity. When I go regularly to the gym I'm more sociable.

&amp;#x200B;

And well, the last night we meet was on a friend's of her house, one of which she said ""was friend and enemy"" and her friend hitted on me but I rejected her and avoided contact.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, my brain is overanalyzing everything and trying to make me feel regret when I should move with my life. I'm in a beatiful university, in a country in which girls hit on me because I'm exotic and I should move on, I barely met her. But I'm naive. I had my first relationship at 26 and these things hit me really hard. And I know I should not expect much from tinder, I have been dumped more than one time and the girls that dumped me told me that they created tinder to forget someone months after dumping me.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, this is very disorganized, but it hurts me to think about this and I needed to do some

774,caetqj,stevogmaz,Dealing with your ex/best friend sleeping with someone else for the first time,"Hi there, so my ex (18F) and I (19M) broke up in early 2018, but since then have maintained a really close (yet rather toxic) friendship which has involved regrettably consistent sex weekly over the past two years. Recently, she started talking to a guy, who is not a direct friend but I have spent a lot of time with him in groups of my friends. Every time she starts speaking to a guy, I just ask her if she sees anything in it, if she has feelings and if she would progress with that person etc etc. I do this because I don‚Äôt want to be having sex with her while she is pursuing someone else, for not only mine and her sakes but for whoever she‚Äôs talking to‚Äôs sakes. Almost every time she has confirmed that these relationships were completely platonic and that has made me comfortable enough to continue being sexually active with her, and with one bloke who she did express she liked in a non platonic way, I denied all sex with her so that she could pursue him without me as a factor. That never panned out, and we eventually went back to having sex again once she decided she didn‚Äôt want to pursue things and I became comfortable again. (Keep in mind I‚Äôm aware this shouldn‚Äôt have been happening at all but I just always get sucked in so I wanted to take at least some measures to make myself comfortable. Anyway the guy that she‚Äôs started speaking to she constantly told me she saw nothing in, didn‚Äôt want to pursue anything and that it was purely platonic. Idm either way but it just effects whether or not I‚Äôm consenting to sex with her. I believed her and we continued doing our thing. Then yesterday she confessed to me that the night before (just hours after I left her house where we hooked up) she invited this guy over and they had sex. This is the first person she has slept with since me (we were both virgins when we met) and while that in itself is really troubling to me emotionally, I understand and respect that she is well in her right to do so. However, I found out later on that all of my friends (the boys, who this particular guy is a part of) knew that my ex and him were more than platonic and that they had expressed attraction to each other and that it was ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù that they would have sex. This was a massive shock to me given that My ex had told me the exact opposite when I asked, so that I felt comfortable having sex with her. Now I feel gross and if I had known the truth I wouldn‚Äôt have been consenting to anything I was doing with her. I feel this intense anger towards her and she was crying saying she needed me and regretted it but I‚Äôve attempted to cut all things off. Every now and then I soften to her but then I remember what happened and it hits me again like a freight train. In the same bed that we‚Äôd hooked up in hours earlier and countless times before she invited a guy over and had sex with him, in a room with photos of me and her all over the walls. It just fucks with me man, I can‚Äôt sleep at all and I‚Äôll forget about it for a moment then it‚Äôll hit me again. I understand she can do whatever she wants and I would respect that fully despite my upset, but the lying about what their relationship was and how soon she did it after she did with me seems disrespectful to me , especially when she knows I‚Äôm not comfortable having sex with her if there‚Äôs the possibility of her being intimate with someone else. Idk how to wrap this up but I‚Äôm just feeling it and it‚Äôs distracting me from my work and sport and I can‚Äôt let that happen. would appreciate any response, and you can check my post history for a more detailed description of my relationship with her and how I find it difficult to cut things off.",2019-07-08 01:37:48,5,1,relationship_advice
775,caetjp,timeofthedoves,"My friend is in an extreamly toxic relationship, how can I support her even if she wont leave ?","My (24f) closest friend who is like my older sister (26f) is in a very toxic relationship for almost the last year. This guy is terrible to her, he's manipulative, he gas lights her, he yells at her fir no reason and calls her vile names, he takes her on vacations and straight up abandons her, the list can go on. And every time they ""break up"" and she claims they're done, they end up back together.

How can I continue to support her? Recently we thought they were done for good, but he was relentless about getting in contact with her, and now they are back together. I'm always here to be her support system, and I know how important it is to be her support system as he has managed to isolate her from most of her friends. But it does get rather tiring to repeat the same mantra of ""he is toxic he is emotionally abusive you deserve better"" for her to be back together with him in a couple of weeks. I am starting to have thoughts like ""stop complaining if you keep going back to him"" but emotional abuse is a legit thing and I dont want her to be isolated. I also fear that the more I openly hate him the more she is going to not come to me for support.

What's the correct way of approaching things like this while also holding back just how much I hate him and want her out of this relationship? Should I still be openly dissing on him? I try my best to not make it seem like I'm implying she is stupid for this relationship because again, emotions are a hard thing to get past. 

I try to see her at least once a week as she lives alone, I text/call when I can. I just know when I dint hear from her for a couple of days its bc they're back together and maybe she's embarrassed to outright tell me. She talks about marrying him very often, and reddit friends I tell ya if she does marry him idek what I am going to do at that point.",2019-07-08 01:37:16,15,1,relationship_advice

780,caeris,Writer-49er,Should I break up with my Boyfriend?,"To start off this is my first real post to reddit! Anyway for context I‚Äôve been dating my boyfriend for about 7 or so months. I‚Äôm 17 and he‚Äôs 15, and there is an age difference but at first he seemed like a mature guy so it didn‚Äôt really bug me. We have similar interests and tastes in music and we‚Äôre both in band at school. I‚Äôve been thinking about our relationship and some things really irk me more than they should. I don‚Äôt really have a good comparison for anything relationship related because all my past boyfriends have either been dicks/borderline abusive to just not working out well. Anyway, let‚Äôs get into this.

To start out I‚Äôm for the most part a quiet introvert who can be loud and energetic when I need but I prefer to be quiet and do my own thing. He‚Äôs strong willed and arrogant with a love for politics, old wars, and cars (this isn‚Äôt a political thing, I‚Äôm just stating facts).

I guess I‚Äôll start out with the big things that caught my attention than to the little things. 

Sometimes we like to go for food and one time before band we went to a burger place and got food, which is all fine and dandy. He paid and whatnot and we got our food. I‚Äôm in general a slow eater as he got done way quicker than I. I was eating my fries one at a time and he reached over, without asking and took one of my fries. I said something about it because I wasn‚Äôt done and he replied with, ‚ÄúI paid, so these are my fries‚Äù or something like that. I wish I said something when he did this but I didn‚Äôt because well, I didn‚Äôt really want to start an argument or anything. That happened several months ago and I can‚Äôt shake that. I wouldn‚Äôt have minded if he simply asked me for a fry and even if he took a fry to say he was hungry or something, but the response he gave rubbed me the wrong way.

Next thing that rubs me the wrong is the way he talks to his mother. (For context his whole family is super nice, though him and his parents have a little beef) For example one time his mom didn‚Äôt do something she was supposed to or ask and whatnot and he gave her attitude, like I don‚Äôt know about how his parents are in that way, but I‚Äôd be in huge trouble if I talked back in the way he does.

Another big thing was when I told him I was depressed. He straight didn‚Äôt believe me even when I told him I‚Äôve felt depressed for over a year and it eventually took me telling him I‚Äôm on antidepressants for him to see that I was. That‚Äôs how he is with a lot of things but this is the best example I can remember.

Another thing is his political views (I don‚Äôt want this turning into a political thing, I‚Äôm just using these as examples). He‚Äôs very strong in his beliefs and it‚Äôs hard to have a conversation with. For example he‚Äôd be talking about something, let‚Äôs say for example something I didn‚Äôt particularly agree with (or at least how he was explaining it) and if/when I am able to get a word in edge wise on my side he‚Äôd double down on why his side‚Äôs right. It‚Äôs hard to hold a conversation when you feel you‚Äôre talking to a brick wall. I don‚Äôt mind talking politics every once in a while but too much makes me uncomfortable, especially when the person I‚Äôm talking to can‚Äôt even see my side. At one point when they were driving me home he commented that he should let me talk more, so it isn‚Äôt just me that‚Äôs noticing this.

Now I said I‚Äôm in band and I play a fairly large saxophone. I wear something called a  harness that goes around my shoulders and cuts down the middle of my chest. I hate how it brings out my chest and it doesn‚Äôt help I‚Äôm self conscious in general but it‚Äôs either that or my neck dying so I deal. Anyway one day I guess I was wearing a tight shirt, (I tend to avoid because again, self conscious) and he came up to me and said that the harness drives him crazy. That still makes me uncomfortable and I felt like taking it off. I again didn‚Äôt say anything but I stayed quiet. 

One time me and his family went to a concert for his father‚Äôs Father‚Äôs Day present. I was walking a little faster then the rest, (now his father has knee issues so I completely understand why he‚Äôs slow) and my bf was keeping his pace. I was super excited for the show and told them to hurry up (playfully, considering) and he‚Äôs like don‚Äôt run off. Now mind you i was a few feet ahead and I was clearly in eyesight of them when he grabbed my arm and told me I could get stabbed or something. I mean fair enough but you didn‚Äôt have to yank me back like that.

Another thing about him is that it feels like I‚Äôm dating a lawyer, (no offense to any lawyers or anything) but one time I was telling him personal info about myself and the first thing he said was sue them. Now I explained to him if I sued my family would probably have disown me (nothing horrible mind you what I said) but he was like the lawyers understand. Like how can I sue my family and then expect to be let in? Instead of being comforting he immediately jumped to sue. 

Speaking about my parents I feel like he doesn‚Äôt like to come to my house. It feels like we‚Äôre always at his house and when I bring up the idea of coming to my house he glosses over it and insists we go to his house. Now what made me think this was one day we were talking about games and I brought up I recently got Detroit Become Human, a free game that was on psn, Now that same day I asked him if he wanted to get ice cream and come to my house and his response was an we play the game i mentioned above. Now it was stormy and I hate driving in general, much less in a storm and he said that it‚Äôs stormy and whatnot and ok we ain‚Äôt doing anything, though he never said anything about cancelling so I guess I just assumed. Anyway he asked if I could drive, and for the reasons above I said I wouldn‚Äôt want to, so his parents dropped him off. Fine and dandy I suppose. When he got here he pretty much played DBH the whole time, which led me to write the whole time because well I do play videogames he seemed more interested in the game then me so I let him be.

It‚Äôs also a good thing to note about myself is that I am usually distant because that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised. I go through periods of wanting to be single to wanting to be in a relationship. It doesn‚Äôt help I‚Äôm pretty much lowkey a hermit at home and I don‚Äôt like to leave the house, so that doesn‚Äôt help.

783,caeqyq,needadviseplsssss,"Parents want to take my Girlfriend (29F) and I (26M) out on an all expenses trip, but she feels pressured.","Hi All,

I am in a tough predicament.

 My Dad is retiring from his work and wants to take our entire family (my parents, sister and spouse, and my girlfriend and I) out on a trip to celebrate the next phase of his life.

My father has been talking about retirement for the last couple years, and has finally decided to end things by flying out our family members on an all expenses trip to Costa Rica at a high-end resort. This trip would be next May and would be for about a week.

To my Father (and both of my parents),  there is nothing better than having all of his favorite people in one place, my girlfriend included. Retirement to him is extremely scary and would be the start of a new life. 

The problem is that my girlfriend does not want to go on the trip. She has never left the country and feels pressured to go to this new place. Additionally, because my parents are paying for the trip, she feels like she doesnt get a say on the matter. She also feels pressured that they are planning a trip with her in mind without her saying yes before. Granted this is a year in advance.

My girlfriend wants me to tell my parents that she will not be going on this trip. 

Here's where I feel a little unsure of what to do. I believe that my girlfriend's concerns are valid, but I also know that my parents are extremely understanding. I believe that if we brought up that Costa Rica would be tough for her, my parents would happily change the location to the US. Same goes for the money. My parents would rather her pay and be on the trip than to leave. My dad just wants to celebrate this new life event  with his favorite people. 

My girlfriend however, believes that if she were to tell her concerns (through me or directly) and they made the changes, that she would feel bad that she was influencing my father's retirement party.

I worry that my parents will feel bad that she cannot come or feel like she doesnt want to be around them and this will stain their relationship.

786,caeq18,Mightyb10,My best friends mom likes me better than her. What do I do?,"This is pretty long so if you want to just skip to the last paragraph that works too!

Okay, so I (19 F) am usually really good around parents and they tend to be very found of me. Well, my best friend (19 F) has a pretty rocky relationship with her mom. 

Her mom will disrespect her a lot, disregard her opinion, in private she will yell at her, she will threaten to cut her off for nothing (the last time was two weeks ago because me and my bestie were going boating and she didn‚Äôt like that), and just stuff like that. 

My best friend is no angel, however, and is almost equally disrespectful back and has a tude. When I am with her and she is being sassy, her mom will text her and say she is being ugly or ask her to go to the bathroom with her to yell at her, but never calls her out blatantly in front of me. My bestie, on the other hand, will sometimes snap around other people and straight up tell her mom she is always mean to her. For example, yesterday I was with my bestie and all of her family/ relatives and her mom told everyone that she was really glad my bestie had me in her life because I am a very good and a kind friend, but my bestie was sad because her mom never says anything like that to her and in front of everyone goes ‚Äúyou never say nice things about me‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt want y‚Äôall to get the wrong idea about my bestie, because while that sounds bitchy her mom was being a little bit mean to her all day and it built up to her snapping. 

After this incident we went up to our hotel room and she was crying about how her mom treats her and about how her mom likes me better and treats me way nicer. Her mom earlier that week had given me a bracelet from her jewelry box that she never wears but matches the bracelet I wear everyday, and my friend was sad because her mom has never given her anything from her jewelry box. I couldn‚Äôt not take it because that would have been rude and I honestly wasn‚Äôt expecting it at all. While I do not know if my best friend has or has not received jewelry from her moms jewelry box, my best friend has trouble seeing how much her parents give her and is under appreciative in my opinion. (She has many gucci and Luie stuff and David Yerman bracelets and doesn‚Äôt work and really can get anything she wants)

I told her she should talk to her mom and tell her how she feels, but she insisted her mom would never listen and just get mad at her.
My problem is that I just never know what to do in these situations. My mom and I are super close and so I never really have experienced this mutualistic destructive relationship. I also cannot find it in myself to be rude to her mom, because her mom has not been rude to me. I do not want my best friend to resent me because of how her mom treats me either. She is hands down the most important person in my life. I just do not really know what to do, should I start being less chatty with her mom, should I just continue being myself and let them fight, should I side with my friend? Currently I‚Äôve been avoiding being around her mom to avoid the situations, but I‚Äôm just looking for advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation, where their friends mom treats you significantly better then them .",2019-07-08 01:27:25,3,1,relationship_advice

We met my freshman/her sophomore year of college and meeting her has honestly been one of the best moments of my life. Us being together just feels so right, like we get along so well, we can talk hours non stop and I love every minute I spend with her. I know she feels the same way as well. Anyways, she just finished college in May, now she works full time and plans to enter a master program part time next year. I am entering my senior year. Since she‚Äôs working full time and I work part time, she asked me to get an apartment with her today. We have discussed it before but never seriously just as a possibility in the future. We talked about a lot of stuff and how things would be divided and honestly I feel ready to make that commitment. 

We‚Äôve been together for a while, we trust each other, we are in love and I feel it‚Äôs the next step. However, there‚Äôs just one issue. Her dogs are annoying. She has a mutt and a Yorkshire terrier and I‚Äôve never met dogs I despite so much. I am not really an animal person, I think they‚Äôre fun but I‚Äôm not one to cuddle them and have them lick me and I know one not ready for the responsibility but that‚Äôs not even the issue. They bark all the time. Like the slightest movement or someone comes in and the bark for hours. I‚Äôm not even exaggerating, I‚Äôve slept at her house and heard them bark for four hours. She sleep through it, but I can‚Äôt. A lot of people don‚Äôt go to her house because of them and even I don‚Äôt want to but I don‚Äôt want to be a jerk about it. 

I told her how I felt, I could tell she was disappointed but she said she understood and said she‚Äôd consider returning her dogs to the shelter. Honestly that‚Äôs the last thing I want, she loves those dogs and I don‚Äôt want to put her in a situation to chose between us. But I do want us to move in together, I want to go to bed with her every night and wake up next to her but I can‚Äôt do it with those dogs barking constantly.

Sorry this is a huge wall of text! A TLDR will be at the bottom! 


My boyfriend (who we will be calling Brad) and I have been dating for 21 months. We met while I was visiting family in the US (I‚Äôm from the U.K.) and I met him there and we‚Äôve been long distance for about 20 of our months. We‚Äôve been making plans to see each other but we‚Äôre so occupied with school and work it makes it a little hard. 

But, for the better part of those 21 months, we were great. We had/have trust in each other, good compatibility and good sexual compatibility. I had and still do have insane amounts of trust him in, and can swear on my life that he‚Äôs never been unfaithful.

It might be important to mention he was the victim of an abusive relationship before me. This girlfriend is evil personified for a lack of better terms. She lied about him raping her, cheated on him right infront of him, ignored him for some online roleplay group, stole his money, and even kicked his cat at one point. And that‚Äôs about 1/7 of what she‚Äôs done to me. ai felt like
this was important to mention for a reason. 

It‚Äôs also important to mention he has an abusive stepfather. His stepdad came into his life when he was no older than 10 and has hated him for not being his own child. He throws him down stairs, breaks his things, and constantly insults him. 

About maybe two or three weeks ago, I don‚Äôt remember, Brad suddenly became very distant and upset. One world replies, being silent on calls, etc. This obviously worried me, so I kept asking him if he was okay and if he needed space or if he wanted to vent to me. He told me was fine and he returned to normal, only to return to emotionally distant about two days later. This cycle repeated a few times.

One night, out of the blue, Brad told me he was really badly depressed. I was worried, naturally. I asked him if he had gone to therapy, if he could tell me, and if he needed space again. I suspected it had something to do with him recently graduating college, so I asked him about post-graduation depression and he said that was a small part of it so I have that going. I was really taken aback by this, to be honest. He‚Äôs always been so open with me about all of his feelings and has never hidden anything from me.

I feel like now is an important time to mention I‚Äôve been depressed before. I know how depression makes you not want to share anything with anyone and makes everything a grey blur but I‚Äôm not asking how to get him to share with me. 

The past week was the lowest I‚Äôve seen him. He didn‚Äôt want to call (he usually always does and is always the first to ask) when I asked to, he told me I should kill him so his miserable life ends, and that so much is going on in his life he feels he has nowhere to go. I was completely lost at this point. I had no clue what to do. 

This morning (for him, it was 4PM for me) he told me his dad had been calling him lazy and said he would
amount to nothing. I felt this was necessary to put in too. 

Tonight, we had our most explosive argument. He essentially just told me he hated everything about his life and he wanted to die. At this point, I began pleading for him to tell me what I could do, or to get help. I told him he didn‚Äôt have to tell me, he just had to tell someone. He then told me that I had to respect that he was never going to tell me and left to go to bed. I‚Äôm writing this confused. I don‚Äôt think I overstepped his boundaries. 

Question: What am I supposed to do? I‚Äôm slowly watching him cave in on himself and I have no idea what I‚Äôm supposed to do. How can I help him?

791,caeow4,mallrat47x,Scared to make the first move,"Long post, TLDR at the bottom 

I‚Äôm a female in my mid 20‚Äôs and I‚Äôve stopped making the first move because I have NO game and I can‚Äôt tell when someone is flirting or not. 

This is a pretty random post, but it‚Äôs just something that‚Äôs been on my mind. I know if I were a guy this would sound like such a friend-zone complaining m‚Äôlady post. 

I have a very hard time figuring out when someone is flirting with me. I often romanticize situations that are just friendly, or downplay situations and completely miss when guys are coming on to me. 

Here‚Äôs some examples of what I mean:

I met a guy at college orientation named Steve. He had a girlfriend that he was head over heels in love with. I thought he was cute but respected the boundaries of the relationship and never flirted. I asked him to come to a few school events with me, but he always declined because he was a commuter. He transferred to be with his gf and I didn‚Äôt hear from him for 3 years. Senior year he started talking to me again. We talked all day, everyday for several weeks. He brought up that his gf broke up with him and reminisced about how he wished he‚Äôd hung out with our friend group more. I asked him to hang out but now that he had transferred he said it was just too out of the way. The more we talked, the more I romanticized that he not only liked me, but was infatuated with me. One night I finally decided to make the first move because I thought there was no way I could be wrong. Turns out I was. He admitted that talking to me 24/7 might have given off the wrong impression but he pointed out that he talks to all his close friends a lot. I figured reaching out to me after 3 years must have meant he liked me then and now, but he admitted that when him and his girlfriend broke up, he lost many friends that they had as a couple and he remembered how kind I was to always include him freshman year. 

On the flip side of this, I have a very hard time noticing when someone is in fact flirting with me. I once went to a bar and a guy approached me. He talked to me about fashion, how accepting his parents were of his life, and he talked to me a lot about following my dreams. Eventually we went to play pool. While I was shooting he was talking to my friend and looking at me. I kept smiling and nodding although I couldn‚Äôt hear what they were saying. At the end of the night he asked to share a cab with us. He asked for my phone number at the end of the night and I gave it to him because I had such a great time. He then leaned in and kissed me. I turned around to my friend completely shocked. I told her not only did I have no idea he was flirting with me, but I thought he was GAY the entire night. Not for one second did I think this man was straight, even when he was complimenting me, because those compliments were the kind I usually only get from gay men. My friend thought this whole thing was hilarious. She said she thought I was into him because when I was shooting pool he was talking about how badly he wanted to sleep with me (sorry I know that‚Äôs cringe to say) and I was smiling and nodding so they assumed I could hear them. 

I have a crush on a friend from high school but I‚Äôm afraid to make a move, and I haven‚Äôt so far. My friends say all signs point to yes, that he does like me, but that‚Äôs what they said about that guy Steve too. I think if he wanted to go out with me he would say something, but I wonder if he‚Äôs thinking the same way I am. Sometimes I think he flirts with me, but I try not to assume that because I know how I can twist it. I asked him to hang out once in a group and he declined due to being busy but didn‚Äôt reschedule. He also doesn‚Äôt drink much and we were going to a club. I have had a crush on him since high school and I hate not knowing how he feels, but also am afraid of rejection and losing his friendship. 

TL;DR: When guys are being friendly, I assume they like me romantically. When they‚Äôre flirting, I assume they‚Äôre gay. As you can see I have no game. I want to flirt more with my friend but am afraid I‚Äôm confusing the signs and will be rejected.",2019-07-08 01:24:13,1,1,relationship_advice
792,caeonh,gdgrf,I (21M) am considering confessing to a close friend (21F) although there‚Äôs little chance it may be mutual.,"TLDR: I like a friend but idk if should jeopardize our friendship but letting her know how I feel.

As the title says, I am in a dilemma as to whether I should even say anything about how I‚Äôm feeling. We‚Äôve been friends for about 3 years .I did have feelings  for her at the beginning when we first met but managed to suppress them completely because I didn‚Äôt think I had a shot. We were always relatively close but we got a lot closer over the last few months. She studies abroad now (UK) and when she‚Äôs there the only we talk is that we‚Äôd Skype every other weekend and I‚Äôd drop a text sometimes. I started developing feelings again and as soon as I did I tried not to let it grow or do anything about it. I THINK the only reason we are able to get this close is because she thinks that I have no feelings for her and it‚Äôs purely platonic. 

I thought that I have managed my feelings pretty well  only until recently. She came back from her studies as she‚Äôs on break and we went out the other day. We spent about a good few hours together, had lunch and window shopping at a place we‚Äôve both never been to.  It struck me that I really liked her a few days after we met when I was out with another group of friends I was walking by a store and remembered the pair of shoes she wanted to buy when we were hanging out that didn‚Äôt have her size. I went in the store to check and there was one in her size so I called her to ask if she wanted me to get it for her then. I did ALL of that, subconsciously; I was not thinking of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna buy it to get her to like me‚Äù. Afterwards was when I realised oh man I may really like this girl. 

I honestly feel like telling just so that she‚Äôll know about it and I do not expect her to feel the same wayi because it she probably does not. However, it might risk a reaction that will throw our whole friendship away. She does have a history of ghosting or not entertaining guys that try to make a move on her (I would know she tells me these things). What do I do? Do I confess or just let it pass?

Edit: She‚Äôs flying off back to the UK in a couple of days so it‚Äôs unlikely that I get to meet her and tell her before she leaves. Therefore I‚Äôll only be able to tell her through text or on the phone, both of which aren‚Äôt desirable to me so I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll do it if I do decide to.",2019-07-08 01:23:34,5,3,relationship_advice

My best friend I told her 3 years ago that I had feelings for her, unfortunately it was not the same for her. She got into a relationship, during that time we saw eachother less because life. 

Recently she broke up and we see each other a bit more. Last month during dinner, she said I was thinking of you, that's why I messaged you to have dinner. I am real potatoe when it comes to flirting so I didn't really pay attention to this, but when I got home I realized I could've say something about this. 

Anyway fastforward to the present, still speak and see each other occasionally, when we go out and we get close to talk, she does this strange thing by giving a small squeeze/pinch when she holds my arm or hugs me (i like the way she does it, does she also do it with others?). During alle the times that we meet I figured I still have feelings for her. 

How do I find out if it changed for her, am I delusional because of my own feelings? And how to casually start flirting, as mentioned before I can't flirt.

We‚Äôre both in college and our schools are 4.5 hours apart, but the biggest reason that we broke up was because we argued all the time over stupid miscommunications. Otherwise, we get along very well. 
Since we broke up, we‚Äôve both gotten a lot better at dealing with the things that caused problems in our relationship, and as a result we‚Äôve gotten a lot closer than when we were dating.

I know it‚Äôs harder for women to cum compared to men, but it‚Äôs not impossible. He has made me cum, but I would say maybe &gt;10% of the time while of course, he cums 100% of the time we have sex. He isn‚Äôt into forelay either. Typically I give him head and we move onto sex. If i verbally ask for it, he would finger me or eat me out, but it‚Äôs rare of him to initiate. I would also need to ask him to make me cum, or he never tries. When he does, he tries for a little bit and if I don‚Äôt cum soon enough he just gives up. I‚Äôll continue to express my dissatisfaction but he will just have sex with me other ways and ignore me. 

The thing is, it does feel great during sex, and I am loud so I moan a lot. I think to him, that‚Äôs an indicator that I‚Äôm happy enough. Yes, I‚Äôm not unhappy during sex but I‚Äôm not as happy about the fact that I again didn‚Äôt get to cum.

The last time we had sex, I initiated, gave him head, and he pulled my pants down and sat me on his cock. No foreplay for me - the usual. Long story short, he gave up on making me cum again so after he came, I told him I‚Äôm gonna masturbate to make myself cum. He was totally fine with it and doesn‚Äôt seem to give a shit that he isn‚Äôt making me cum. 

I‚Äôve tried expressing my dissatisfaction about this but he doesn‚Äôt seem to care enough to actually change. His sex drive is lower than me in general and he is super vanilla while I am super kinky so I feel like he doesn‚Äôt understand my needs. I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I‚Äôve even thought about doing a r4r thing when I‚Äôm out of town to ‚Äúblow off my load‚Äù without letting him know (so it doesn‚Äôt hurt him) but idk if that‚Äôs a great idea. I expect people to jump to the ‚Äúbreak up with him‚Äù advice but anyone who can provide constructive feedback would be more appreciated :)

799,caem20,Quinc-a-lot,"My (30f) Mother (55f) continues to date man (55m) who cheated on her, wants is to accept him.","TLDR: Mom is dating a man who cheated on her, broke up with her, lied about cheating, then she for unknown reasons took him back. She is very happy despite dating a piece of shit. It hasn‚Äôt been long and she is gearing up to ask up to accept him back into the family events and to be allowed to be around my family. I‚Äôm not ok with it, and it‚Äôs gonna be a thing. Looking for advice.

Quick backstory: My father passed away three years ago. The end of his life was not easy (alcoholism and major accident). My mother has since started dating and we (my brother and I) are very happy for her. She dated a few guys for a short while and then found a guy (Scott) whom she dated for a year. I am extremely close with my mom (talk daily) and I was the cheerleader. He made her happy, he‚Äôs smart,  seemingly nice guy, in the end I was all for her being with Scott.  In fact, of all the family I was the one saying ‚Äúhe makes her happy ray is what matters more‚Äù. She changed A LOT in that year, lost a ton of weight is very ‚ÄúI do what I want‚Äù etc. I learned my mother doesn‚Äôt move slow in dating. So in that year he was at all family events, holidays, you name it. There were some moments I struggled bc I felt she was putting him before everything else and had changed so much.... but she was so happy I let it go. Chalked it up to mom has a new phase of life and I need to adjust.

Present: Out if the blue in early May he came over to her house and dumped her. Seriously it was super unexpected. They were spending the night... the night before, then boom ‚Äú we‚Äôre over‚Äù. She was heart broken. Two days later we find out through connected friends that Scott has been dating another woman (also a widow) for THREE months. Telling her that my mom was ‚Äúa friend‚Äù and full on dating this other woman. We also find out that the day he broke up with my mom... he drove straight over to this other woman‚Äôs house for date. He denied cheating to my mom... until the other woman sent her literal proof (emails, texts)....then he admitted it. He said he ‚Äúwent to therapy bc he wasn‚Äôt being a good man‚Äù  and a bunch of other bullshit about how he feels bad... despite literally showing no remorse until my mom had proof. He‚Äôs a fucking shit bag. The level of hatred I have toward him is hard to put into words. Seeing his picture makes me angry... that level of hatred. 

Well my mom let him have it. And while she was hurting post beak up she was still trying to go out with friends etc. I believe it was the normal healing post beak up. Well....Less than a month later on Memorial Day weekend she called me to let me know she took him back (this was also pretty sudden). Now here‚Äôs the thing guys. From what I know, SHE reached out to him for ‚Äúclosure‚Äù then it was ‚Äúwe‚Äôre back together and he deserves a second chance‚Äù.  She told me she was unmoved and that it was ‚Äútrue love‚Äù. They dated for a year.... he cheated for 1/4 of that time and yes she thinks it really ‚Äúlove‚Äù. I also learned that part of his reasoning for cheating on her was ‚Äúi take full responsibility, I fucked up, however you didn‚Äôt want to talk politics and dint seem open to religion so I felt that was not healthy so I acted out‚Äù. To me... this is gaslighting and frankly he supports trump which is why the political bullshit came up and that, in and of itself, is distributing to me. He has three daughters and this is how he treats women. I am disgusted to say the least. 

So my mother has made clear she is WITH him. Myself and my brother (separately) made clear we do not respect him and he is not welcome around us. We both have young children and I do not trust or respect him, therefore I do not want him near my son. As a rule I don‚Äôt allow people who I don‚Äôt respect let alone trust near my child. My mom said she will respect my wishes. However, and here is where the advice comes into play, she said ‚Äúin the future if I‚Äôm still with him we need to discuss him being included. I plan to take it slow but even if you don‚Äôt like him you need to be polite and invite him to things bc he is my partner‚Äù.  At the time I told her, ‚Äú we can discuss this again in the future, I make no promises‚Äù. My brother told her similar. 

Well it‚Äôs not even two months later and she is NOT moving slow. Every weekend their together. Most weeknights. Romantic weekend away too. She asked me to ‚Äúsupport her in her happiness‚Äù. I told her that I am glad she is happy but that does not change my stance on Scott. So she tells me how her and Scott did all this great stuff, and I say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you had a good time‚Äù. I AM glad, I really truly want her to be happy. She deserves to be happy....but it in no way changes what I think of this asshole she is dating. 

Advice:  My mom has not officially asked for him to be included.... but it‚Äôs coming. She is hinting at it though talking about him constantly. When I speak with her she is Talking about how HIS daughters include her.... his daughters do not know this happened and my mom hasn‚Äôt cheated so of course they don‚Äôt have a problem. 

Well at the beginning of September my best friend is getting married. My mom is of course invited and before Scott showed his true colors,  he was assumed to be her date. She is gearing up to tell me she wants to bring him. I am NOT of with it AT ALL.  I am in the wedding, maid of honor. I can‚Äôt NOT attend. We have a family member who lives near the wedding venue and had all planned to stay, I am NOT staying under the same roof as him. This is not just for me, I will tear him a fucking new one and my mom will not be ok with my telling him exactly what I think of him and his actions. Outside of this, my brother is getting married this year too.... and I am pretty sure she wants him to come to that wedding as well (my brother is already stressed and told me she better not even fucking ask... but she will). Logically I get it, she sees him as a partner so why shouldn‚Äôt he get to go. However he fucking cheated, and even when he was caught lied until the other woman sent my mom proof! I do not understand why ANYONE would allow him near our family again. He is not trust worth and frankly I think he‚Äôs a sociopath)he had no remorse) I do not get it. Maybe if they were together for another year and he was a saint in that time.... but it‚Äôs been not even two months.

To add to this my mom has said some things which are IMO untrue and unfair. She is claiming ‚Äú if your husband cheated on you, but you said you really loved him I would forgive him‚Äù.... mind you my mother also is still mad at my husband for snapping at her ONE time bc her dog shat in our house 10 times. I think she is being unrealistic and the anxiety of knowing what she is about to ask is killing me.  It‚Äôs coming, and when I say ‚ÄúI am not ok with him being around my family‚Äù I might seriously hurt our relationship. I think in the end she will choose Scott, over family. And if we don‚Äôt bend she will be upset. If we do bend and say he can attend, I‚Äôll stop coming to family events. It‚Äôs going to be a shit show for my small close knit family.

801,caekug,Jpetrean19,A confused and distracted heart.,"Hello, people of Reddit. I know my situation may not be as grave as some of the other ones I‚Äôve seen on this subreddit but I could use some advice. So grab your popcorn and kick back because this could be a long one. Ok, here goes nothing. 

First off, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Jonathan, however, everyone just calls me J, I‚Äôm 20 years old and on June 2, 2019, I broke up with my girlfriend Emily after being together for 1 year and 6 months. Emily is originally from Wisconsin but now, she‚Äôs in Tallahassee attending Florida State University. We met via snapchat in March of 2017 when she ‚Äústole‚Äù Harriet‚Äôs (a mutual friend of ours) phone and sent ‚Äúsnaps‚Äù to all of Harriet‚Äôs ‚Äústreaks‚Äù, and I was one of those ‚Äústreaks‚Äù. I sent a snap back to her jokingly saying ‚ÄúWho are you and what have you done with Harriet?‚Äù Eventually, I got Emily‚Äôs snapchat username and we started texting and getting to know each other more and then I eventually got her number. We then texted more and more until one night, we decided to Facetime for the first time and that‚Äôs when I fell for her‚Ä¶ hard! I was all gushy saying things like ‚ÄúLook how beautiful you look‚Äù and we ended up FaceTiming that night until about 3am. We officially got together on November 11, 2017 and everything was great, we always talked and came to a solution whenever we had reached a road bump in our relationship and she was also one of my best friends and she always looked out for me and loved me unconditionally. 

The reason I decided to end things was because my parents kept saying that she‚Äôs not the one for me. So I prayed and asked God (because I am a Christian) if it‚Äôs the right thing to do and, sure enough, it was because whenever I was specifically in church, I always had this feeling that something‚Äôs not right in being in a relationship with Emily. I then broke up with her over FaceTime on June 2, 2019. It was an ugly FaceTime and both of us shed tears. I told her that I could never hurt her and that I loved her to bits but I wanted to obey God and my parents. 

However, on May 30, 2019, a mere few days before I was going to break up with Emily, I had a dream about this girl from my church, Lois. The dream I had was similar to the dream that Thor has in Avengers: Age of Ultron in Barton‚Äôs house: Flashes of Heimdall and of Asgard. Only instead of those, I saw flashes of Lois. [She‚Äôs in my church‚Äôs girls choir and the mixed choir and I‚Äôm also in the mixed choir as well as the men‚Äôs choir.] I thought this was a bit strange that I had that dream because at the time I had it, choir practice was cancelled the previous 2 Mondays. (the 27th and the 30th of May) (Choir practice is every Monday) So she has no reason to be in my dream because she couldn‚Äôt have been fresh in my mind when I haven‚Äôt seen her in about 2 weeks. Another reason the dream is weird is because I don‚Äôt talk to her at all. I only see her around but that‚Äôs about it. We never ever spoke before.

The day after the dream, I decided to shoot her a quick ‚ÄúHello there.‚Äù DM on Instagram. I wait for a while and let her take her time. Nothing, she left me on ‚Äúseen‚Äù. I send a message identifying myself. Still nothing. My mother then says that I should talk to my aunt Roxanne because she‚Äôs a good friend of hers and she often went out with Lois and her friends on a girls night out. Roxanne then fills me in on some info on Lois. She tells me that she‚Äôs just a bit younger than me (by 30 days, to be exact), she‚Äôs a very nice and sweet girl, not temperamental at all and that she attends the same college that I do. My mother brings up the idea that Roxanne should introduce me and Lois to each other. That idea remains up in the air but then Roxanne decides to take matters into her own hands.... 

Fast forward to Sunday night, June 9th, 2019. Our church was being visited by a youth choir from Canada and we hosted a dinner after service for our esteemed guests. During the service, my mother texted Roxanne behind my back to perhaps introduce me to Lois later that night after service. My mother told me what she and Roxanne have been planning and throughout the entire service, I was absolutely crapping myself. My heart was beating fast, my hands were shaking and I‚Äôm pretty sure I was a bit pale as well. After service ended, I decided to go down to the basement area of our church where the dinner was going to be held and wait for Roxanne. I sat at a table with some youngsters from our church and browsed my phone and made small talk for a while, still petrified and having no idea what‚Äôs about to happen. Around 10-15 minutes pass and I‚Äôm sitting at the table eating when Roxanne comes out of nowhere and taps me on my back and says to me ‚ÄúSo I talked to her, I‚Äôll tell you later‚Ä¶‚Äù and she just ran off holding Abby, her 2-year old daughter, leaving me in suspense and curiosity. I finished eating and then I drove home where we had a get-together with some family members, including Roxanne. She then came into my room to talk to me. 

She told me that on their way down to the basement, she pulled Lois to the side and told her that she has a secret admirer. According to Roxanne, Lois‚Äô face then started getting all red like she‚Äôs blushing. 

Lois then asked ‚ÄúSeriously? Are you kidding?‚Äù 

Roxanne says ‚ÄúNo, I wouldn‚Äôt kid about a subject like this‚Äù 

Lois asks ‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù 

Roxanne says that it‚Äôs me and she told her that I DMed her but Lois said she left me on read because she thought I was ‚Äútrolling‚Äù.

Lois said ‚ÄúI thought he had a girlfriend.‚Äù (She must‚Äôve seen pictures of me and Emily on my profile). Roxanne covered for me and said that I had broken up with her. Lois then said she was going to take some time to think about it. And then Roxanne saw that Lois went to the entrance of the basement and she said that Lois looked straight at me (according to Roxanne, it was around about the same time that I was sitting down with the youngsters at the table) and her face was turning more red‚Ä¶

At this point, I was ecstatic. I felt like I was on top of the world and could conquer anything. Until the very next day. Monday, June 10th, 2019, at around 3-4 PM, I was at work when I received a DM from Lois herself on Instagram saying ‚ÄúHi Jonathan, I spoke to Roxanne and I just wanted to let you know that I am not interested.‚Äù Now, I‚Äôm not gonna lie, this crushed me. When I first read it, I had to do a double-take because I couldn‚Äôt believe what I just read. Then as I processed it in my mind and the day passed, I was very confused and I still am to this day.  

Here are my viewpoints on it. It could be God‚Äôs way of saying to me that I‚Äôm too early because I had just broken up with Emily about a week before this incident. My mother and Roxanne said that maybe she never had a guy crush on her until now, so she was a bit nervous and decided to focus on school rather than a relationship. These are both very possible. 2 days after being rejected by Lois, the idea came to me that maybe I should talk to Simona about this, a very good family friend of ours, and a long-time member of our church. (My mother actually went to her for advice back in the day on what to do with me and Emily because she saw no end in sight) (Simona also has 4 children, 2 of which just recently got married. That‚Äôs why my mother went to her, because she knows a thing or two about dating/relationships). 

I tried to move on from Lois but I still have this feeling about her and she‚Äôs always on my mind and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about her. Maybe, just maybe, there‚Äôs a small chance that she‚Äôs the one. Maybe alarm bells are going off in my head because that‚Äôs God saying ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the one, but not yet.‚Äù because why else would she react like that only to reject me the very next day? 

Thank you for taking the time to read this immense novel-like post. Any and all pieces of advice would be very much appreciated. I‚Äôll try to update you on whatever happens next, if anything, and I‚Äôd be more than happy to answer any questions.

I have tried not to romanticize her in my head and I've tried my best to date other people but I can't seem to move past these feelings. I want to be clear that the last thing I want to do is come between her and her boyfriend. I see how happy they make each other and I find that very meaningful. I've been friends with both of them for years before they even knew each other and I actually helped set them up. I also recognize that me and her would likely not work out, not do to with anything bad about me or her, rather we just don't have that special connection needed. I really value my friendship with her and I would hate to lose that. I also can't stand the though of losing one of my closest friends (her BF). I've thought about just putting distance between me and her and kind of avoiding her for the most part but I know that she has had past experiences with friends ghosting her and how hard that was for her. I don't think that is fair to do to her but it could also be the right thing to do, I don't know. Like I said I don't want to lose her as a friend. I am at a loss for what to do because I don't want to feel this way but I'm not sure what to do to help me to move. I worry confronting her about my feelings my risk my friendship with her and her boyfriend. If anyone has been in a similar circumstance I'd love to know what did and didn't work for you. Even if you haven't what do you think would be the best?

807,caehss,PullingElephant,My (23M) girlfriend (20F) is really cheap,"We‚Äôve been dating for a long ass time, like almost 3 years and we recently moved in together. She‚Äôs great and I love her but some of the shit she does is soooo frustrating like God damn 

We get those sale magazines in the mail and I always throw them out bc it‚Äôs garbage and it takes up space on the table and she gets mad if she finds it in the trash. She spends so much time on that shit like she will sit there for hours reading everything and cutting coupons out for shampoo and soap and toothpaste like it‚Äôs 30 cents you‚Äôre saving. Is it that serious. It‚Äôs embarrassing when she uses them in the stores bc it takes forever and I tell her it‚Äôs fine and she insists on using them 

She also collects cans and bottles for the 5 cents back. that shit is so annoying. She needs 400 cans for $20. It‚Äôs a waste of time she‚Äôs just making shit harder for herself 

And when she gets Starbucks, she gets a large size with no ice and then rations it throughout the week and adds her own ice every morning. I will gladly buy her a drink every day, a normal small size with ice so she can drink it and throw it away but she likes doing this 

Not only that but if it‚Äôs past fucking 4 pm she won‚Äôt go out to eat because the time for lunch specials is over. Like damn sometimes I wanna eat out for dinner. And when we do go out, she takes extra plastic spoons and forks and napkins home bc apparently they‚Äôre more sturdy and better quality than the ones from the store. 

Also if I‚Äôm taking a long shower, she knocks on the door and says our water bill is gonna be too high. Sometimes I want a long shower and I just wanna stare at the wall while hot water is rushing over me. It‚Äôs therapeutic",2019-07-08 01:04:03,18,2,relationship_advice

811,caef7b,80sfamilyguy,Advice: Ending an eight year relationship. What to do about the dogs?,"I've been in a monogamous, long-term relationship with a guy for eight years. He's just over 10 years older than me. There are a number of reasons why I want to end things. The most glaring issue is that we want very different things in life and are at very different places right now in our lives. I'm happy where I am, and he wants to move to a state I have absolutely zero desire to live in. Earlier in our relationship, he talked about wanting kids. I had no desire to have kids, but now that I am thinking about kids I know that I don't see myself raising them with him. We have had a good relationship, though the sex fizzled out after a few years. We've had great times together, but I think it's time for me to move on. I haven't been happy in a long time and have felt more like his roommate for several years. We sleep in the same bed, but sex is a rarity. I want more. He's a very sensitive guy, so I'm trying to breach this delicately so I don't send him off the deep end.

We have two dogs and we both absolutely love them. I paid for both dogs and have paid their medical bills and for most of their food and other care over the last few years. While it will tear me up to lose one or both dogs, I think it will tear him up the most. I'm considering letting him have one or both dogs in the breakup because I think he will need that to cope with the breakup even though I think I would be able to care for them better. I do still love him, but haven't been in love with him for a while.

813,caeder,poopoopanther,I‚Äôm extremely mad at my parents and I don‚Äôt really know what to do anymore.,"My dad threatens to kick me out whenever I make a mistake. 

So my parents recently moved and I was home in their new house for the summer from school. The garage is extremely tight and it‚Äôs almost impossible for any movement except for getting in and out of the driver door. I accidentally parked their car and parked the front where it slightly was dented into one of those plastic tubs that you find at Walmart that had old games in it. 

And my dad came home furious and I apologized. So I started crying because I felt like his rage wasn‚Äôt necessary. He started guilt tripping me saying that I wasn‚Äôt taking care of their things because their car isn‚Äôt nice and I‚Äôm being careless. It was truly just an honest mistake and I only checked the rear to make sure the garage wouldn‚Äôt scrape the back and didn‚Äôt really pay attention to the front. And again it‚Äôs really hard to check as there‚Äôs almost no wiggle room for anything. And it was like my first week of parking in their new garage. 

Whenever my father gets mad, he guilt trips and stays mad for about a week bringing up other shit that you‚Äôve done in the past. So just so sad as why he made such a big deal about this, I cried to my mom and then he comes barging in and screams, ‚Äúwhy did I do so wrong? Why am I the bad guy?‚Äù And so then he proceeds to yell at my mom saying ‚Äúyou are enabling her right? Calling me a psycho? She thinks I‚Äôm a psycho now because of you‚Äù and all this other garbage. I didn‚Äôt say anything and then he told me to pack my things and get out of the house. 

I ended up apologizing to him because he was making life a living hell for my mom and my mom begged me to apologize because he threatened to stop paying for my school. So I did. And things have went back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ever since. 

But I‚Äôm still furious. It‚Äôs been a year and I still haven‚Äôt been able to let this go. I went back to school miserable knowing that he was paying for my school. I still have two years of school left and I don‚Äôt think I can stand him paying for my schooling.

814,caed6h,nub96,BF(24) cannot understand me F(23),"I am one of those people that have a hard time multi-tasking. When I first worked as a hostess I often got scolded for not hearing phone calls because I was focused with other things. It took me a long while to learn how to focus on alarms that customers rang from their table, while I was working as a server.

My boyfriend is saying that what he says isn‚Äôt important enough to me if I‚Äôm not able to hear him while I‚Äôm on my phone and that FB is more important. I‚Äôve told him numerous times that if I‚Äôm on my phone it means my attention is on it. I get furious (inside) if he tries to talk to me while I‚Äôm trying to text something important, because I can‚Äôt text and listen at the same time.

I do not CHOOSE not to hear him, if I‚Äôm reading an interesting news or post I end up zoning things out.

People miss bus stops while reading books, surgeons have assistants to listen to alarms while performing jobs because it‚Äôs possible to not hear things when focused.

He refuses to believe that can happen and he cannot understand why I am mad. I am mad be cannot believe some people are different. He is accusing me of not putting enough importance on what he has to say, which is not true. He could‚Äôve talked about one of my family members being in danger and I may have not heard him.

I never stay on my phone for long periods when I‚Äôm in a car ride with him. Even yesterday in a 6 hour long drive I was on my phone maybe less than 5 minutes. I try to keep him as company as possible especially on long drives because I know it‚Äôs tiring.

TL;DR : Bf is upset that I don‚Äôt put importance on his words (I only show upright uninterest when he talks about the manga (cartoon) he reads.) when I didn‚Äôt hear him because my attention was focused on my phone. Bf cannot understand some people have a hard time multi-tasking. I am more upset than him RN because he is believing I couldn‚Äôt hear him because his words weren‚Äôt important to me. He is asking me why I am upset. How should I settle this?

818,caea6j,jakea522,"Me, 20M, need advice on relationship with boyfriend, 21M.","Hey everyone. I haven't turned to reddit before in the past but I am just feeling insane lately and I don't want to make a rash decision.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been with my boyfriend, 21M, for a little over a year. We met on Grindr. Neither of us wanted a relationship, and the first time he came over we just exchanged blowjobs and he left. Since then, we have been together almost every day with the exception of weeks one of us is gone or whatever.

I'm basically just going to try to go over every major thing in the relationship I can think of and put it in chronological order

&amp;#x200B;

We met on June 20th, 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything was fine for a while, the first major conflict we had was regarding his roommate, who would be rude to me behind my back in a group chat with the other roommates. She came home blacked out and on coke and started arguing with my boyfriend and I who were drunk that night and tackled me to the ground. I confronted her about it a couple of weeks later and she accused me of stealing her phone that night, which I knew nothing about. I yelled at her, she yelled at me, whatever. Then my boyfriend and I argued for days about it and nearly broke up. He told me I needed to apologize but she didn't want to speak to me so I just sent a text saying I was sorry and out of line (not because I felt bad but because my boyfriend told me to). He then told me I was texting her that I was sorry to be problematic basically and I was wrong for accusing her of doing coke and blah blah blah basically he said I was wrong. I don't really remember what happened after this, but I know I ended up giving in to get him to stop arguing with me. Months later my mom (who was in town with her friends this night, but left when the roommate got home and started causing a scene) confirmed that she was on coke. I guess one of the other roommates said something when they were walking in and my mom heard. Since then my boyfriend has told me he was sorry and he was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Another big source of conflict was one night when we went out with my best friend to the bars. She was clearly drunk by the end of the night but he seemed fine. On the walk back he said something and I think I told him it was rude? I don't really remember. What I remember was that he backhanded me across the face and chipped my front tooth and made me cry. We get to his apartment and I get my backpack to leave. He goes into a rage and grabs me by my backpack and throws me on the floor. My friend walked out the door. I left my backpack and left the apartment. My friend and I walked back to her place. It was locked. We call an Uber. My boyfriend calls and is crying and wants me to pick him up, so I ask the Uber to get him. On the 10 minute drive back to my apartment, he attacked me from the backseat continuously. I mean he really hurt me. The Uber driver kicked him out a little ways from my apartment but within walking distance. My friend and I get back, I lock the doors, get her in the shower bc she was puking. He shows up, bangs on my door. I let him in, he continues to hit me. I lock him out of my bedroom and he bangs on my bedroom door. I let him in he continues to hit me. Eventually I went into a rage and hit him back and overpowered him. Looking back, I am a little scared of the person I became for those 30-45 seconds. I was overcome by just pure anger. He is now crying so I get him to bed. The next morning I tell him what happened but I lied and said I didn't hit him back. I know this was wrong. Eventually I tell him yes I hit you back, it was self-defense. I'm sorry I lied to you. We had a few large arguments regarding whether I was justified in the amount of force I used. He, although he was blacked out, claims to remember laying on the floor and watching me hit him. I told him that I was defending myself and he had been assaulting me all night. The argument goes on for so long that I break down into tears and tell him I'm sorry I hit you too hard. In hindsight, I think I did use a lot of force and I feel bad for that, but at the same time I feel it was justified.

&amp;#x200B;

The next thing I want to talk about: I cheated on my boyfriend. In August I slept with someone else. I didn't think about it again for months until about January when I became conscious of it. I didn't want to tell him, and lied about what had actually happened before I told the truth. E.g., I told him it happened in June rather than August. Once I told him the truth (I cheated on him in August), he hit me in the face several times, left me with bruises and an enormous black eye I had for weeks. I didn't leave my house for days. This sent me into a major depression. My boyfriend told me that I needed to go to counseling if I wanted to stay in a relationship with him, so I did.

I met with my counselor probably around 10 times over the course of 4-5 months. I think there were a few good things that came out of the counseling:

1. When I was 14-16, I would get on Grindr and have older men (anywhere from 20-65) come over and have sex. I don't know how many people I had sex with, but I'm guessing between 50 and 60. This really weighed on me because in the years since I developed guilt and shame. I have only ever talked to my boyfriend, my best friend, and my counselor about it. Prior to opening up to my boyfriend about this, I had lied and told him the number of people I had sex with was much smaller. As the relationship progressed and it became apparent that I hadn't only had sex with 7 or 8 people like I had told him, I broke down and explained and he hugged and forgave me for lying. Counseling has really helped me come to terms with my past and accept that I was a child then and didn't truly understand what I was doing.
2. I have a much better relationship with my dad and younger brother, which was previously very strained. I could go more into depth but it isn't really related
3. I don't think of myself as a liar anymore. Not that I thought of myself as such prior to counseling, but looking back I would definitely consider myself a liar. I've learned to live my truth.

&amp;#x200B;

When my boyfriend and I were going through this, I remember he told me I was ""just a slut"", that I only needed a warm hole to be happy, I wasn't worth his time, that he has plenty of people who want to have sex with him and maybe he would, etc.. I understand where these things were coming from. They still play like a record in the back of my mind when I'm alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, we haven't really had any major sources of conflict, but rather small things that are becoming increasingly bothersome over time. Lately, my biggest issue has been that I do not feel like I am respected in the relationship. My boyfriend often commands rather than asks me to do things for him. ""Open the door"", ""close the curtain"", ""turn the light off"", rather than ""could you \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, please?"". I have brought this up with him several times, telling him it feels disrespectful. My friends agree that he is disrespectful, but not in a blatant outright way, in a more subtle way that makes me feel wrong for bringing it up. When I do say something, I am met with ""did you have to bring this up right now and ruin the mood?"", ""why can't you accept me for who I am?"", ""I know you're a sensitive person but you should know me better by now"".

&amp;#x200B;

Today, we had an argument which is what prompted me to get on here and ask for advice. Last week I lost his house key. I apologized and told him I would pay for it. We have both been gone over the weekend, so he called and asked them to have the new key ready today. He called me at 3:40pm and told me that he need me to leave and go pick up the new key now. I thought this was disrespectful of my time, but I knew I was the one to lose the key so I went. Since I was in a hurry, I left my backpack at my apartment. When I get to his apartment complex, they told me he didn't order a new key but they were going to come unlock the door. I get the door to his apartment unlocked, and he wants me to stay for 20 minutes and wait for him before I go back to get my things. I told him I didn't want to stay. Nobody else was home so I knew the door would stay unlocked. I leave, get my things, come back. I knock on the door, he doesn't answer. I Facetime him to ask him to let me in and he answers with ""go home"". This is not the first time he was done this to me and I expressed how unhappy it made me last time. I told him to open the door or I was going to break up with him. He hung up. I call back, and say again, open the door, or I'm leaving you. He hung up, so I left.

&amp;#x200B;

I texted him to please get my things together and I would do the same. He told me he was balling his eyes out and that he felt so blindsided. He wanted to call and explain. I said I didn't want to talk and I didn't need an explanation. 30 minutes later I did eventually answer one of his calls and told him that I have already talked to him about feeling disrespected and this was just the straw that broke my back. He told me I'm not perfect either, he is sorry, he was mad because I left when I wanted him to stay and I make everything all about me all the time. I asked for an example because I didn't think it was true and he said he would not provide one. I said okay, I need time to myself to think it over. He said he loves me, and I said I love him too and hung up.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess where I am at right now is feeling like I am going through a lot of suffering and pain because of his actions. I feel like I am expected to help him out whenever he needs it and do whatever he asks me to do when I've told him before I would rather he do what he needs to do on his own and I do the same. I've expressed frustration with having to do favors constantly for him and brought up that I rarely if ever ask him to do anything for me. I feel like I am constantly making sacrifices for him and each one goes unnoticed until I bring it up, when he tells me that it isn't unnoticed and he appreciated it, but it doesn't really feel like I'm getting any kind of resolution.

I love this man. He was forgiven me for a lot of shit that I regret. When things are good, they're great. But somehow I feel like I've lost my individuality in the process of trying to please him. Or do I feel this way for some other reason? I don't know. I want to know whether to stay or to go but it seems unclear. I don't know what to do and I feel like I'm going insane because of it.",2019-07-08 00:42:25,1,1,relationship_advice
819,cae9zs,sashaaa333,"I (F20) fell for a guy (M29) who has two kids, one he didnt tell me about for weeks - advice please?","TL;DR at bottom
So basically I met this guy on a night out and immediately hit it off personality wise, had unbelievable fun and a great laugh. I initially wasnt attracted to him and had no intention of sleeping with him. My friend (housemate) ended up talking to his friend and intended on bringing him back to ours so I invited the guy I was talking to back to mine for a drink and a laugh.
We get back to mine and end up sitting in my room laughing and talking for hours and he tells me he has a 3 year old daughter which is no biggie that happens when you go for older guys. We ended up sleeping together that night and I actually became really attracted to him and the sex was mindblowing.
I initially presumed it was gonna be a one night stand however he took my number and we kept in contact and he came over to my house quite regularly to have a laugh and sleep together over the course of a few weeks maybe 3 months or so.
I made it clear that I didnt want a relationship (due to him having a daughter and being a good deal older)  and he agreed and said he felt the same and a few days later we lost contact.
Fast forward a few weeks and I moved back home to my parents house which is about 200km away from where I was living and I get a text from him and things click right back to how they were before - getting on like a house on fire with a spark between us.
We talked everyday for a few weeks and I eventually decided to go meet him for dinner and drinks and to spend the night at his.
Everything was going great we had a really good night and stayed up talking for hours. I could feel myself developing feelings for this guy as we've been meeting up and talking for weeks/months at this stage and he is the total opposite of every guy I've ever been with.

He then tells me that the reason we stopped talking a few weeks back is because his ex girlfriend (with whom he has the 3 year old daughter with) gave birth to his other daughter! 
Obviously I was quite shocked and didnt know how to react so I just asked why he didnt tell me and he said because we weren't going to get into a relationship he didnt feel comfortable telling someone he was seeing about it which I can understand to a certain degree but he also said that we had confided so much in each other over the past few weeks that he felt guilty not telling me and felt it would be better in person.
I went home the next day and we rang each other that night and talked about it properly when we were both sober and I could tell he felt serious guilt about not telling me but he also told me his newborn was quite sick when she was born and he didnt want to be around anybody.

So, I need advice!
Do I continue whatever 'this' is knowing he has two kids even though I'm quite young myself knowing that a relationship between us is unlikely? I wish I could just cut things off but I have feelings for him and just enjoy the natural spark we have between us theres no pressure for anything when were together we just naturally thrive off each others energy. 

TL;DR - met a guy out, was meeting him for weeks, we lost contact and I moved home, we regain contact a few weeks later and everything goes back to how it was, he then tells me his ex gave birth to another daughter of his that he didnt tell me about, at this stage I already have feelings for him - what do I do!?",2019-07-08 00:41:56,2,1,relationship_advice

A few weeks ago, the girl I like confessed to me, which really confused me as I heard her talk about her boyfriend at the beginning of the year. I am a very skeptical person, so I straight up asked her if she was joking (looking back, that wasn't the greatest idea), and when she replied that she wasn't, I told her that I liked her as well. It went pretty well after that, and we texted for several hours a day, during which I learned a lot about her. I found out that she did actually have a boyfriend, however, she broke up with him several months ago, which cleared up that confusion. 

Now here is where the advice is needed. I also learned that she facetimes him nearly every day and goes out with him pretty often (shopping and movies). I'm curious as to whether it is normal to spend that much time with an ex, and if she really likes me or is just confused and still likes her ex. I really like her, but whatever the outcome, I don't want her regretting her choice, and she seems happy whenever she talks about her ex. 

I'm also want to know what to do going forward. She has invited me to go skating with her and some of her friends. I obviously said yes, but after that, she started getting busy, so we slowly started speaking less. Her responses got shorter and she said she had to go more often, so I decided to stop texting her and give her some space until she was ready to talk. It's now been nearly a week since we last spoke, and I don't really know what to do.

Again, I am sorry if that was hard to follow, I was basically venting. If it helps, this is the first time a girl has liked me, and I have never been in a relationship before. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",2019-07-08 00:38:38,4,1,relationship_advice

827,cae6rz,riceanxtra,What to do about significant weight gain?,Ok so I am 5‚Äô10 130 pound female and my boyfriend is 6‚Äô1 250 pound guy. We have been dating for  two years and he is the absolute love of my life I love everything about him. We just recently got engaged and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. The only thing I‚Äôm worried about is his steady weight gain. When we started dating he was about 190 pounds and since then he has gained 60 pounds pretty recently. His family are almost all completely morbidly obese and I worry about his health and I miss when he was a healthier size. Whenever we go out to eat he gets two entrees and he snacks constantly . He is always drinking soda and iced coffee too. I‚Äôve asked him if he wants to go on a diet with me or if he wants to exercise and he always says he doesn‚Äôt feel like it and he gets incredibly sensitive and gets his feelings hurt. Like if we are out to eat and I say something like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get water instead of soda what do u think?‚Äù He automatically jumps that I think he is disgusting blah blah blah. He even has told me that he could never give up soda and that having a couple bottles of soda a day isn‚Äôt even bad. He has been steadily gaining weight and has been having to buy new clothes pretty often because he outgrows the old clothes. Iv been getting worried because he can‚Äôt even go on a walk without breaking out in a sweat etc etc. I asked his mom for advice and she said not to mention his weight because it ‚Äúhurts his feelings.‚Äù Idk what to do I am worried for his health and I also want a husband that enjoys working out with me and staying in shape. What should I do? He refuses to workout or eat anything healthy or even cut down on portions. Am I being insensitive? Or crazy? After his mom told me to not bring up his weight because it hurts him I feel slightly bad but also weirded out that she doesn‚Äôt care about his weight gain either. What do I do??? I workout often and eat pretty healthy and my family is the same so I am new to this side of things. Any advice?,2019-07-08 00:32:59,8,2,relationship_advice
828,cae6r9,realitytvlover24,Unsure if I am overeacting,"So my husband and I have 2 small children together. Since being pregnant with our second and havjng her 4 months ago. Our relationship has been strained. 

Money has been tight as well because we have 2 homes, 2 mortgages. 

Anyway he works shift hours as a paramedic so he has a lot of 6am - 6pm shifts.

He started training this young woman so they would spend 12 hour shifts together 4 days a week. 

I will straight out say I am jealous not only of her pre baby figure but also the relationship they are building as all the things we used to talk about they do. 

I know I'm an asshole for checking his messages however he has made it sound like she is always iniating conversation on messenger.  (She is) however he responds and they have created a dialogue. 

There is nothing suspicious in the messages however I am super uncomfortable and find it crosses a few boundaries for me. 

I have calmly discussed with him that I don't feel good about their friendship and that I would prefer he keep it professional. 

Since then he has changed his password because he feels violated me checking on him. ( this is fair) 

However they don't work together anymore but they still talk to one another. I'm stuck in a position where I want to leave but can't because if children and my career was on pause for 5 years because of him. 

The more he talks to her the more my walls go up and I just stop talking about it now. 

Am I overreacting or should I follow my instincts. For example she suggests songs for him to listen to etc and I guess that's how we started as I wanted to impress him with how well versed I was with the music scene. 

I just need to know if I have a right to be wary as things don't sit well with me or if I am just focusing too much on something that isn't there. I just feel if he ever said I feel uncomfortable with a relationship I had with someone I would cut ties immediately as I would never want him to feel that way.",2019-07-08 00:32:55,3,1,relationship_advice
829,cae59f,wut1235,I'm tired,"So here's the deal. My boyfriend and I are very different people. I'm very affectionate and show love through physical touch most of the time whereas he has switched from being very affectionate and touchy to showing it in very small simple ways. I see each one and appreciate it. I have not once wanted him to change anything about himself, I still don't. Im not even sure what I need or want at this point other than to vent. 
He gets in these moods where, as he describes it, he doesn't feel much. The only thing he says he feels during these times is extreme guilt because he knows that I can sense something is up and he just doesn't want to be around anyone or anything. I've tried to ask him to just tell me and I will out of respect for his feelings make myself scarce and do something in the office or even go visit my family nearby but he said that would only make him feel worse. I'm exhausted. I don't know how else to handle this situation. I've asked him countless times if there's anything I can be doing to better help him or to better understand but he says I'm doing everything right. I realize I'm my own worst enemy and I'm sure I'm taking things way too personally but I can't help feel the distance and the insecurity begins to rise. We consistently come back to this topic of him not being emotionally available and it will end with both of us crying, things will be off for a few days, be perfect for a month (almost exactly, I've been keeping track on my calendar), then come right back to it. I personally also have my own mental demons I fight with every day (diagnosed ptsd, generalized anxiety, and bipolar 2) so I actively try to not let my mental shit affect his mental shit which causes me to not talk about if I'm going into a depressive episode. I don't want him to feel guilty because there's nothing he can do to make it go away. I've suggested therapy, he says he'd be willing but because he hasn't taken the steps to get that started I suspect he only said it cuz he thought it was what I wanted to hear. I just wish I had my sweet, smiling, loving man back, he's lost in his own head and I can't pull him out.",2019-07-08 00:28:54,8,2,relationship_advice
830,cae58s,altmonkey78,My ex(18F) broke up with me(18M) last year. How do I move on?,"So I spent a solid year and a half dating this girl. We hit it off right from the beginning, would talk day and night. Had mostly good communication throughout the relationship, a little rocky in the beginning as we were both new to dating but ended up getting pretty good at it. Sometimes when the other one wouldn't open up, which wasn't often, we knew each others tells and always talked it out and cheered each other up. One thing that really sucked though is that her mom never truly liked me. Her mom and sister had other plans for her, aka finding someone local, as I lived a few hours away but we'd talk everyday and I would visit her almost every weekend. They would always go back to ""We don't know him"", but I would come to family events and setup dinners to help them with this. It was just an excuse. Anyways, back to the point, the rest of her family loved me, especially certain aunts, uncles, and her brother. Not her sister though. Her sister would skew stories and even make up lies to tell her mom, just because she wanted her sister dating one of her friends. I was never rude to any of them, made sure to stay respectful. Had a few dinners with her whole family(all uncles aunts and grandparents), explaining my intentions (no messing around, wanted to marry this girl), and answering any questions they had. I never talked crap or was part of the lies her sister made up about me. Anyways right around the end of last year, my ex broke up with me. She said her mother didn't approve, and that she needed to grow on her own. I even called her parents up and explained I'll come over we can go out and talk about this over dinner. The parents kept saying no no no, just move on and find another girl. So I didn't go. Why be in a relationship where I can't get along with the girl's family? That's important to me. Anyways, I loved this girl and I still do. I've talked to her a few times since then, and of course we have fun but then say ya know it was nice catching up cya around. She wasn't doing well at the beginning but seems to be doing much better now and maturing. She is still dodging guys, while I've tried talking to and getting to know a few girls the last few weeks. I thought I was ready, and maybe I'm not. I've really only spent a good amount trying to get to know 2 of em, one of which her and I decided to be just friends but we still joke around and talk a bunch, but the other one keeps hinting at doing couples stuff. It just doesn't feel right. Maybe I'm not ready, but its been more than half a year. I think I just haven't actually processed that it happened as I've just delved deeper into my work and hobbies to prevent myself from thinking about it too much. Do I need to talk to someone? I'd tell my friends but I don't want to burden them. I also have one friend who's told me he really doesn't see me with anybody else, that we were perfect for each other. I've run through the thought of trying to get back together but should I? Honestly I'm just really confused what to do. I don't wanna run around finding other girls if the one for me is right in front of me :/

TLDR: Girl broke up with me cause some family members didn't like me and she needed to mature herself. Don't know if I'm over her or what to do. Just confused

831,cae56m,lutstone,I (27F) am in a kind of weird situation with a guy (26M) who is in an open relationship,"I don‚Äôt really know what I want to ask here, but I got myself in a weird situation and I guess I need some outside perspective and advice.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I need to start with saying this first : I‚Äôm talking about an ex-coworker here. We do not work together anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I (27f) am working at a restaurant for 3 months now. And after work, we sometimes go out for a drink or hang out etc. There is one of the coworkers (26m) I never was interested in him or even thought about him that way, and all I knew about him was that he has a girlfriend. We‚Äôll call him F.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

One night, we all went out for drinks and stayed out pretty late. And since we got a little tipsy and I live far, he offered I spend the night at his place, on the couch, instead of walking 1 hour home by myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we went to his place, along with another co-worker, we stayed up together, just listening to some music, talking, and playing some quiz games. Then at one point, the 3rd guy went to the bathroom to take a piss, and I was talking to F, when he slowly started getting closer and then kissed me, I didn‚Äôt reject him, and kissed him back. Then we stopped when our friend came back and we pretended like nothing happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once the friend left the house. We were left alone and we started making out. Then I stopped him telling him that I didn‚Äôt think it was a good idea to go any further that night. he stopped, we talked, a lot, we kept talking till morning, we got to know more about each other. He then explained that he‚Äôs been with his girlfriend for 8 years, that 1 year ago she wanted to open the relationship so she can explore more, he agreed even though he doesn‚Äôt like the idea, but wanted her to be happy. He said that she was the only one benefiting from the situation, and that things has been bad between them lately. He told me that he pretty much based all his decisions on her, he followed her to this city for her studies, but then 2 months ago she went back home for an internship leaving him alone, and that too hurt him. I didn‚Äôt want to say anything about the matter‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

An 8 years relationship is a huge deal. I personally have never been in a long term relationship, but I can‚Äôt see myself be in an open relationship with someone.

Anyways, I ended up sleeping on the same bed as him, we just cuddled, kissed and talked till morning. The next days, we spent them sneaking around, stealing kisses and hugs when nobody was around at work. He couldn‚Äôt stop himself from coming to see me whenever he got the chance, and he started helping me a lot which I found pretty cute. We used any little time we had to hang out, spend some alone time together and get to know each others.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

One week later, he changed the job, so we‚Äôre no longer co-workers. But we still kept seeing each others. I started going more and more to his place, watching stuff together etc. we ended up sleeping together a week later, and we just couldn‚Äôt stop anymore. We spend almost all our free time together, and we have a lot of sex. He‚Äôs always asking me to come over, to spend the night at his place, we went to the movies together, we go out for a walk etc, and up to this point, I was thinking that I‚Äôm just a hookup, that he has a girlfriend, that he‚Äôs feeling lonely and he‚Äôs using me to get the company he needs. 

&amp;#x200B;

The more I started thinking about it the more it started hurting me.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, after work, some co-workers decided to go out for a drink, so we went to a bar, and since F is still good friend with everyone, he joined us too. So we were there pretending we didn‚Äôt see each other since he left the restaurant two weeks ago, while the truth is I just spent the previous night in his bed. After that, he invited me over, since his place is closer, my co-workers didn‚Äôt find it suspicious at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once in his place, we started talking, and one thing led to another, and he ended up telling me that he thinks he‚Äôs in love with me. I didn‚Äôt know how to react, and told him that he can‚Äôt be, that he‚Äôs in a long term relationship, he has a girlfriend, and 8 years is not negligible. Sure they‚Äôre going through some rough patches right now, but she‚Äôs still his girlfriend, they‚Äôre still together, and it‚Äôs not going to end, and those feeling are maybe just him being lonely and needing some company. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He told me that we‚Äôre sending all of our times together, and that if he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend things would be easier, but he‚Äôs feeling great with me, he loves spending time with me and he‚Äôs been questioning his feelings for the few last days before coming to this conclusion. He told me that he never planned on this to happen, but he doesn‚Äôt consider me as just a hookup but way more than that and he‚Äôs having feelings for me. And everytime he called my name during sex, he actually wanted to tell me he loves me so badly.

&amp;#x200B;

 I‚Äôm so confused and can‚Äôt get myself to trust or believe him, and at the same time I don‚Äôt know what I want out of this relationship. All I know is that I got attached to him, and that although I can‚Äôt call that love, but I have some sort of feelings for him‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt even think about making him choose between me and his current girlfriend, since I myself is not sure about what I want and don‚Äôt want to ruin their relationship",2019-07-08 00:28:40,18,4,relationship_advice
832,cae56k,InfamousDivide,My Ex (26F) and I [34M] broke a little over a year ago We both went zero contact. I have a question about giving her back mementos and legal mail this week.,"I've just begun going through the whole house to see what can be kept, thrown away or sold. I'm embarrassed about the length of time it took me. Anyway after going though the mess, I found old birthday cards to her on important birthdays and holidays from her best friend and some car documents for a new vehicle and jury duty things.

The question I have, is should I give it back to her? I don't know if she knows I have them but I also want to not get in touch with her.  Her brother and I were good friends and he would definitely take them to her from me. I don't want to make it a whole thing though, I just know on the flip side I might want those things.  Should I throwaway or give back?

834,cae4qf,Fluid_Rest,Me (53F) frustrated and worried by husband's (58m) repeated unemployment. Advice?,"We're married over 20 years, have twins age 18, both in community college, one has special needs. Husband's industry collapsed about a decade ago that led to spiral in employment- 5 layoffs or firings or not making it through training in past decade. Unemployed a total of about 4 of the last 10 years. I'm a teacher, have taken on four additional extra duty gigs (summer school, night school, tutoring, Saturday school, etc) this year alone to make ends meet.

I'm so darn tired. Relatives repeatedly express concern for him. I've been stress eating (I know, my own fault) and my health is crap. I work with special needs and feel like I keep giving and giving in all areas. 

He is doing uber, but not regularly. He just got laid off on last day of training for last job plus his dad just died. 

I want to be supportive, I want to be kind, but I also want to kick him in the butt and scream. I just returned from work trip and he did not help our special needs daughter on assignments as I requested- she's going to have to have constant hand holding to get her through. 

I'm in the process of applying for a second part time gig on top of day school and night school. I'm so resentful I could scream plus we have in-state university coming up for our other twin in one year when she completes community college. 

When is it okay to say enough is enough? I can afford to support me and the twins and our household. I don't want to destroy our family. But I'm so tired- emotionally and physically- of supporting a 58 year old. And if I hear from his family ""you sure do like to keep busy"" one more time, I will scream.He seems to be in deep depression- after a more recent layoff- I insisted on antidepressants for him- which led to terrible results. 

I may sound totally heartless. But I feel like I can't keep propping him up.

835,cae4jv,CrunchyDoodles,"Me (F33) and my boyfriend (M35) had an argument about my frustration that he doesn't listen, and he left. :(","Hello all,

First of all I just wanted to establish that I have ASD, I can get frustrated easily. I try to manage it as best I can, but admittedly it's a struggle. Irritability is common with those on the spectrum, and when you're a girl it can really compound. My boyfriend knows about my condition, though I'm not sure that he understands it. 

Anyhow, over the last 6 months or so I've grown exasperated with my boyfriend not listening when I need him to understand important things. He is a very sweet guy, very thoughtful and smart. I feel bad any time I get angry with him, but the instances where I genuinely do get angry with him have been increasing, and if I say anything he avoids taking responsibility for it at all costs (making it doubly-frustrating to feel like he gets what's going on). 

Ex. The Most Common Scenario:

I have a young and very energetic dog, I adopted a puppy before I met the boyfriend in question. The dog can be a handful at times but we both love him. If he sees my BF, it takes quite some time to calm down before I can leave the house without him flipping out (I live in an apartment so keeping noise down adds to my stressors).

Because of this I established awhile ago with my BF that if we're going to go out, he needs to just wait in the car. I asked he not come up into the apartment because it would set me back by a lot, it would commit me to calming the dog down again for 10-20 minutes.

Invariably.... As he did tonight, walks in the door while I'm getting the dog calmed down so I can leave. This is a huge problem for me, because we've been through it so many times before and it's not sticking. (What makes it infuriating to me is there's no reason for him to even come in if we're going out! It just throws a wrench into my whole deal for no reason. ) I nearly cried this evening I was so frustrated that he was not getting it at all.

So, he left and took his things. I told him it was stupid to leave for that reason, but I'm not going to stop him. Not only does he not listen when it's genuinely important information to me, he has no interest in taking responsibility for it in any way. He simply shrugged it off and said it wasn't going to get any better.

Perhaps I should take that as a hint, it just seems like a terrible waste. My dog has been whining for him for hours now, something he has never done before. Anyway, I'm not sure what I'm asking for anymore but I'm surprised and more than a little upset.

Thanks for being a friend. :)",2019-07-08 00:27:00,0,0,relationship_advice

837,cae1e1,nathank2563,"My girlfriend (19f) thinks I(22m) scratched her car's paint, and that I won't fess up to it.","tl;dr: I drove her car (both with her present and not present), and there is decent damage to the car that I had no clue about. On her end, I'm fairly sure to her it seems cut and dry.

Context: We've been dating for 8 months. I work on the east coast while she lives on the west coast. 4th of July was the first weekend in awhile that I had off, so we booked an airbnb on her side of the country while I flew over. 

I don't have a car in the west coast, so for the whole weekend we used her car. She's very trusting  in letting me drive her car. I drove for pretty much the whole weekend (I like it when she hugs my arm while I drive). Of the time spent driving, about 90% of it was with her in the car. As for the other 10% of the time, it was spent with her studying for exams at the airbnb while I ran an errand to target, grabbed boba for us in the same shopping center, and went to pickup some takeout . There was no indication that I had caused any sort of damage to her car while driving, and I specifically remember taking special care to not park too far into my parking space so that her bumper wouldnt sit over the cement parking bollard. Its worth mentioning that she glances at her car checking for damage pretty much every night, and shed told me that she didn't notice any damage until I had already taken off for the east coast.

While driving home today after landing in the east coast, she calls me and asks if I hit her car on anything. I reply no, and ask why. She explained that on her front right bumper, right underneath the headlight, there was a piece of paint missing that was larger than the size of her fist. I asked her if there was any paint from another car, or if there was any sign of curb rash, to which she responded that there was no paint from another car or any curb rash. My first instinct was ""Holy shit I drove the whole weekend, she probably thinks its me."" --Now this is where I fucked up: I spent the rest of the phone call adamantly denying that I did it, so much so that in hindsight it seemed like I was placing the blame on her. I called her back, and rephrased what I said by saying ""Yeah it probably happened while I had the car, but I swear to you that I have no clue what happened, I have to memory of me damaging your car, and if so I would never lie to you about this.""

She was understandably angry, but wouldn't talk to me past saying "" I don't know what you want me to say, I heard you the first time."" After this, she said she was going inside and hungup. After multiple texts and phone calls, I haven't received a response.

&amp;#x200B;

On my end: I feel fucking helpless right now. I know exactly how it seems from her end- I damaged her car while driving, and didnt say anything in hopes of letting it blow over or something. Only thing is I KNOW I was careful and I know that there was no moment where I damaged the car or even put myself in a situation to. I would never lie to her about something like this, and I'm frustrated trying to rack my mind over when and how it happened. The only time she drove this weekend was driving home after I drove us to the airport, and I really don't want to be the guy to blame it on that small drive compared to how much I drove the car over the weekend, as it most likely happened when I was in possession of the car. 

I just don't know how to respond or go forward. How do I handle this situation? I feel like my situation is so damning that no matter how honest I am, it will only come off as me being dishonest about the whole situation. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Also, deepest apologies for formatting and pacing of this post, my mind is all over the place at the moment from a 5 hour flight and 4 hour drive home.

Edit: after re-reading my post, I realized that it‚Äôs written in a way where I‚Äôm worried about placing blame away from me and onto her. However, that‚Äôs not the case. I‚Äôm more concerned with the fact that I have no clue if she believes me or not, especially because of how damning the situation is",2019-07-08 00:18:15,6,1,relationship_advice

As the title states I‚Äôm just in need of some positive comments or stories to remind me that relationships aren‚Äôt easy.

844,cadzgs,Skeeteryeeter19,Am I crazy for something I (F19) did on a ‚Äúdate‚Äù with this girl (F20) ?,"Was what I did crazy?

So last week we made plans for basically a date yesterday, but like prior to it this entire week we‚Äôve been snap chatting and texting and she made it seem like she was into me (she said I was sweet and cute or whatever) or at least had some interest and we talked a lot. But, this entire week she‚Äôs been sick and she doesn‚Äôt eat nor take any meds for it, and she still goes to work and hangs out with friends etc. (She has an 104¬∞ fever) she made the plans for the date while she was sick too, so by the time yesterday came around it was pretty bad. The plan was for her to get off work around 4 and I‚Äôll drive down to her for dinner and a movie. Well she said she was really sick and I kept asking like ‚Äúdo you not want me to come?‚Äù , ‚Äúwill you be upset if I come see you?‚Äù, ‚Äúdo you want me to?‚Äù etc and she never gave me a clear answer, she kept avoiding the question which made 0 sense to me. It seemed like she was stuck between being sick and didn‚Äôt want to be but still wanted to see me so I had no idea where to go from here. So it got pushed back a couple of hours and I‚Äôm just said ‚Äúfuck it I‚Äôll surprise her and show up w stuff bc she‚Äôs sick and we can just hang at her house‚Äù which was mentioned earlier in the week.

So then I get some stuff, I bought soup, a bottle of water, flowers and meds to bring to her when I get down there bc ya know gifts and stuff. She last texted me at 6:11pm and I left around 6. I got there around 7 but her place is like an apartment complex so I couldn‚Äôt just go and knock on her door. I called her and she didn‚Äôt answer nor did she answer my snap (she usually responds right away) so I assumed she fell asleep bc she‚Äôs sick which I didn‚Äôt really mind but I didn‚Äôt know what to do because i was an hour away in another state just for her (yes i know I‚Äôm crazy) so I kept calling her bc like what else was I suppose to do?  She wasn‚Äôt answering and I have no where to go. When  this happens with my friends I just call them a bunch of times to wake them up, so yes I called a lot and it may have been annoying but I apologized afterwards but I honestly just didn‚Äôt know what else to do. I‚Äôm going to seem crazy for this but yes I called her 25 within 3 hours because I waited there for 3 hours for a response.

In those 3 hours i went to subway. Mind you she works at subway and I know that but I seriously just wanted subway. I walked in and was getting my stuff but I asked them if they knew Lauren (that‚Äôs a false name) and they obviously did since this was the only subway by her house. One of the workers is her best friend, and I told her about how I know her (we met through tinder), how i was there bc of her and why, Etc. so I ate my sandwich and left to just go fuck around down there until hopefully she answered. She didn‚Äôt. 3 hours went by then she she finally responded by leaving me on open on Snapchat (she normally does not do that) and hasn‚Äôt responded to any of my texts or calls. So i went back and gave her friends the stuff i bought (minus the flowers bc that‚Äôs awkward) since I had no use for it and left.  She has ignored me all day since then, not saying a word about it and won‚Äôt talk to me. 

I really liked her and thought she was sweet and cool, but I really don‚Äôt know what to make of this. I know it was a little crazy to go there (it was an hour drive into another state) when we hadn‚Äôt exactly confirmed plans, but did I really fuck up that badly that she doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me?

Update: yeah I fucked up. I went crazy and overboard which happens when I get confused. Any tips on how to handle it here on out / how to handle these kinds of things in the future? I texted her a couple times earlier today apologizing but I stopped and not going to again because I know it was just making it much worse even though I just wanted to say sorry. I never meant to come off creepy, but I fucked up and I feel awful about it.",2019-07-08 00:12:50,5,2,relationship_advice

848,cadwzl,Forestgreenclock,My[early 20s] girlfriend [Later 20s] is pregnant. I don't know what to do.,"I'm going to start this off by saying that I love her, despite everything.

My girlfriend is pregnant, it's not exactly planned, we had a if it happens it happens sort of mentality (As we agreed it's something we want together). But without going into it, we didn't expect this to happen so quickly because of medical reasons.

I'm scared to shit. I'm so far from ready it could be a sob story. I'm of the understanding that no one is actually ready, but compared to those people, I'm stark naked in a battlefield unready.

I'm basically broke, I've only just begun to build savings, I've only recently entered the workforce after a rocky start to my life, and while my girlfriend is a bit older, has a house car etc, I don't have anything to really contribute yet. I'm really, probably not at the maturity level I should be either, I suppose. I was expecting this pregnancy to come within 2-3 years, not immediately (Yes I was niave as hell, sue me).

That all said, I'm willing to step up the best I can, and I'm pretty excited. I can live and adapt to this, if it was just this.

There's no real way to say this without sounding like a selfish jerk, but my girlfriend is my first partner, and I never really expected to settle down so fast. I feel like I've deprived myself of life experiences, especially so since I'm only getting older. I've only ever had sex with her, and she's my baseline. I have no idea if our sex life is healthy or not. (Insert quote about grass being greener) it especially hurts, as it feels like I'm betraying her by having these desires.

Leading on from this, our sex life isn't what I'd like it to be, at all. We've struggled with this, talked about it, but even before the pregnancy it was around once every week /two weeks, where as I'm a firm believer it should be at LEAST once a week at our ages, if not more. I feel like I'm the only one who initiates, which leaves me seemingly desperate. I just wish she'd make more of an effort. Now during the pregnancy it's understandably less, and I'm okay with that - but I'm extremely worried that it'll set a precedent for the rest of our relationship that infrequent sex is okay, especially as we will be busy with the baby. And I'm really not okay with that.

I've dug myself into a difficult place, and I know that I've only got myself to blame. I really do love my girlfriend, and honestly that's what makes this so difficult. I don't want to abandon her and my child as it's not fair, and I'll never forgive myself (definitely not an option, for the record) But at the same time I know I'll always regret my lack of experience, especially if I'm stuck with a dead bedroom. There's no middle ground here either.

I apologise for some details being vague, and I've purposefully excluded a few important, but revealing details too as my partner also uses reddit.

I'm going to stand by my girlfriend and child, no matter what - but is there any other perspective I could be missing? Does anyone have any advice that could help?",2019-07-08 00:06:35,22,2,relationship_advice

850,cadw6y,stuckintheburg,star crossed-country lovers?,"Just an East coast Juliette wanted some feedback: 

I (24) met this guy (22) on Hinge in May. We had an instant connection and so many things in common; which is rare for me because I am so picky and a little guarded. Two days after we started texting, we had a 6-hour long phone call. The next week, he traveled almost 2 hours to meet up with me for our first date and we had a ton of fun together. On the date, we talked about his temporary move to California for 3 months for his new job and my move to start grad school. It was a really transparent conversation about what we both expected for our budding relationship and the future- he was honest and we both admitted that we wanted to keep talking and getting to know each other while he was away but that we both wouldn't be offended if either of us hit it off with someone else in our new cities or wanted to explore other opinions. I take things super slow so I was fine with just continuing to be in contact for the next few months and seeing where it went.¬†  
Two weeks go by after the date and it's business as usual- texting 24/7, phone calls, etc. Once he moved, the texts got fewer and farther between which I expected because both of us were starting new adventures. Out of nowhere, he friend-zoned me telling me he was doing 12 hour days and that he just didn't have enough time and that I deserved someone who had the time. I was so surprised, but I responded that I understood and that I'd never want to stand in his way getting adjusted to his busy new job and I'd probably be making the same decision if I were in his situation; especially since I was starting grad school also at this same time.¬†¬†He thanked me for understanding, and I appreciated him not ghosting me, HOWEVER,¬† I was still super pissed about it days later because it was so random. I texted him back and explained that I was more upset and disappointed that my prior responses let on and that I felt a little led on by him because if he really felt that way I wish he would've told me after our date instead of making me feel like things were progressing. He apologized and said he was trying to avoid this situation happening and that he felt bad.¬†  
Normally if I get friend-zoned, I just accept it wasn't a match and move on, but I can't seem to let this guy go. I'm so picky and we had a connection I've never experienced with anyone else before (which he also ADMITTED to as well and confuses me even more that he would do this) and I want to try again when he comes back to the East Coast in September. How do I go about arranging this without making it seem like I've been waiting for him to come back? Every once in a while we exchange a text or a Snapchat, but it's not as frequent as it was- it's still on great terms though and picks right back off where we left off. I don't want to come across as too pushy or forceful but I also don't want to let this guy go because I see potential.¬†",2019-07-08 00:04:23,1,1,relationship_advice
851,cadvkt,givemeamilkshake,I don‚Äôt want to hang out with my cousins kids. What to do or say?,"Hello! I‚Äôm posting on a new account bc I don‚Äôt want my cousin or other fam members to know I‚Äôm feeling this way. 

My cousin has a 1.5yr old and a new born barely 2 month old. I‚Äôm also currently pregnant about 6 months. 

The issue is that I‚Äôve struggled with mental illness (depression and anxiety) for the past few years that really came to head with the pregnancy, leaving me to quit my job a few months ago. I was ecstatic about this pregnancy, but my anxiety has been going into full throttle lately and anytime I think about becoming a mother, I start to panic and freak out. Naturally, I‚Äôve been coping with this by ignoring the fact that I‚Äôm pregnant as much as possible (not doing anything reckless, but just wanting to focus on non-pregnancy related things such as camping, hiking, playing with my dogs and focusing on being a dog mom‚ÄîI am planning on starting therapy again soon). And part of this has been that I haven‚Äôt really wanted to spend time with my cousin and her kids. I know she needs the extra help because her husband has just gotten back to work, and I live pretty close by. But I feel like she expects me to come over more and has been asking me to come on certain days, especially since I am not working right now. 

I‚Äôve been obliging for the most part but it‚Äôs stressing me out more and more and I get a little upset every time she asks. I want to be there for her and not let her down, but at the same time I hate putting on this fake smile and trying to play with her kids, when in reality it freaks me out because it keeps putting me head on with something I don‚Äôt want to face just yet. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love them with all my heart but I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm currently in the right mind set. Everything just starts a panic attack within me that I just try to smile through. Like watching her breastfeed makes me feel so worried about how there‚Äôs going to be a child completely reliant on me and how my life is about to flip upside down. And just trying to converse with baby talk makes me focus on all the areas of my life that is about to change. I used to just enjoy spending time with my nephews, but now every little thing just invoked a bit of terror in me that I just try to smile through. And honestly I just want to spend as much time now not being around kids and just hanging out with my dogs and taking them on adventures for as long as I can keep my focus on them. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I should just keep obliging and go, and I need to get over this and be there for my cousin since I know she would do the same for me. Or if I should say anything. But I do not want to offend her, and I know my help would mean a lot... so not sure what I should be focusing on right now. Any advice would be appreciated !",2019-07-08 00:02:30,4,1,relationship_advice
852,cadvel,masterz13,My wife cheated on me. Now what?,"My wife and I have been together for 6 years (dated 3, married 3). We had been having some problems in the marriage for a while now, such as she feeling spread thin between work, her friends, and I; lack of intimacy (lost her sex drive), me being more of a stay-home introvert versus she being social; etc. That said, we loved each other and accepted each other's faults and were even about to start doing counseling to better understand each other. She decided to go out with some mutual friends to some bars and a concert last night -- totally fine. She had intended to hook up someone we both knew with someone from her work, but those two didn't seem to connect. So I get a message at 3:20AM saying she's done and going to Uber home. I wake up at 5:50AM to see the message and hear her in the shower. We have sex and go to sleep.

Fast forward to today and she goes to her best friend's house and calls me. She's very upset and crying hard about something, saying she is going to take her stuff and stay there for a few days. Wondering if I did something, I keep asking, but she said she doesn't want to talk about it. Hours later, she calls back and tells me what happened. She said that recently (likely last night in that 2-hour span) she slept with someone. Let me be clear: she is NOT someone I would have ever expected that from. I could feel the extreme guilt and disappointment in her voice as she spoke with me; it was tearing her apart because she said she was definitely not that kind of person and she loved me deeply. She said she had been unhappy for a while and it happened. She wouldn't give me any details regarding who/where it was, but I get the feeling it was the guy she was setting up the work date with.

My question is this -- what the hell do I do? I love my wife and am still willing to do counseling. I feel that my actions partly led to these events because of the pressure I put on her to give me time instead of work/friends, as well as having bad anxiety issues and needing her. That said, a close friend of mine reminded me that ultimately cheating isn't something that happens spontaneously -- there's effort on that person's part, especially when they are choosing not to stop.",2019-07-08 00:02:00,116,134,relationship_advice
853,cadv7s,Slytherin1353,My dad might die if I can‚Äôt help him,"My dad has been having issues with his leg since he was a teenager. It all started when he had been riding his motorcycle on the road when his leg got smashed against a car going in the opposite direction. When this happened, he broke his femur really badly, along with breaking his big toe. Because of this, he had a rod put into his femur to support his leg. 

About two years ago, my dad was walking alongside my grandma when she tripped. In order to keep her from hitting the ground with too much impact, my dad grabbed her and fell himself to soften her fall (it worked and my grandma was fine). When he did this, basically, his body turned so that he landed with his butt on the ground, but his leg stayed facing the other way and broke only a few inches away from the previous break.

When my dad arrived at the local hospital, he said that he wanted to go to a different hospital (this one was known for being really bad with injuries such as broken bones). The surgeon heard him say this and the bastard purposely jacked up my dads leg so bad that the bone pieces weren‚Äôt even touching each other (this would have made it literally impossible for the bone to grow back together).

After a year of misery and hoping that the doctor did the right thing, it became clear that he didn‚Äôt and the bone wasn‚Äôt going to grow back together. In fact, the doctor literally put a screw into my dads bone, where it was POKING OUT AND RIPPING THE TINDEN!!! My dad couldn‚Äôt even move without having horrible pain so he decided to go to a different doctor a town over. The new surgeon did all he could but my dad kinda... gave up a couple months after the second surgery. He stopped going to the doctor, doing physical therapy and taking care of his leg overall. 

No one can get through to him about his medical needs. By now, he‚Äôs probably going to have to get the leg amputated but he won‚Äôt go to the doctor to see because he‚Äôs really scared of what they will say. 

I‚Äôve begged him for months to go have it checked out but I can‚Äôt convince him. I‚Äôm really scared that the legs gonna get infected or something and kill my dad. I lost my mom when I was really young and the thought of losing him too irks me. 

On top of his health, my step mom won‚Äôt go to the doctor for her medical issues (what we think is breast cancer, kidney infections, etc) until my dad is well again because she knows she will be put into the hospital and won‚Äôt be able to take care of him.

I‚Äôm so scared for both of them, I need any advice on getting my father to the hospital that you can think of. I‚Äôve tried everything I can think of and nothing is working. At this point, anything helps.

Soooo things have happened. And I'm even more fucked up about the matter than before.

First of all my bf asked me to marry him. Not a proper proposal but more along the lines of ""what if"". I didn't answer. Then a couple of days later he told me that he has been thinking about breaking up because he doesn't feel like he is right for me and that I'd be better off on my own. 

Then in a short time he called me worthless and that I'm boring to be around. It took a lot on my mental health since he has been that ray of sunshine that has kept me going and hearing that from him broke me down completely. We talked it out and he explained that he has been upset and irritated about some things at work and with our friends and he just got angry and unfairly took it out on me, saying things he didn't mean to. I haven't really been able let it go and it has caused a dent in our relationship.

Vintage cars are a huge thing in my country and this weekend there was a 3-day event that we went to. For most people with cars this means driving around, listening to rockabilly, drinking and having fun. The father of our friends has an old Buick that we get to borrow for these events. So the first two days it was us two, my bfs best friend, his girlfriend and the dad that went. But the last day, yesterday, the older brother (the one I've fallen in love with) joined as well. 

At one point we ended up in the back seat together and he put his arm around me. Before I knew it he was holding my hand, hugging me and even touched my breasts a few times. If I had tried to kiss him I think he would have kissed me back. I'm not gonna lie, I really wanted to and I was on cloud fucking nine only being in his embrace but I didn't really think much of it, I mean, he was really drunk and I thought maybe he just didn't realize who he had in his arms. That was until today when he messaged me and apologized for his behavior and said that he didn't want to cause trouble between me and my bf. As in ""I like you but I don't want to come in between your relationship"".

The father had noticed us and said (quietly and when it was only us two) that he thought it was cute and looked very genuine. I pretend to not know what he was talking about. I've also lied to my bf, our friends and him saying that it wasn't like that, I get very cuddly when drunk, which is true, but also that I would have acted the same no matter who sat beside me, which is a lie. 

I don't know what to do. I'm super frustrated and this is just making everything worse. I just hope things won't be awkward now.",2019-07-08 00:00:30,15,0,relationship_advice
855,cadupx,throwawayreladvice00,Boyfriend of 1.5 years asked for a break which resulted in us breaking up for good.,"Background: I asked my boyfriend (20) to put more of an effort in to our relationship and make me a priority by planning dates and making me feel special because I wasn‚Äôt feeling like I mattered. He did not do anything to really show me that despite me asking multiple times and being very clear about my expectations and needs so of course we have been arguing about it. This resulted in my boyfriend saying the relationship stresses him out and he wants time to be alone and to focus on himself. He asked for a break which I wasn‚Äôt really okay with but he gave me an ultimatum between a break or breaking up. I chose a break. After that conversation he deleted all our social media photos and basically ghosted me (before this we texted everyday and spoke a few times a week). He spent the whole time partying and with friends. The break has been really hard on me and detrimental to my own self worth and sanity. 

On top of all of this, my grandmother got really sick and had to be hospitalized and he just wasn‚Äôt there for me during that time despite me asking for support that I needed because prior to this he was my main support system. 

Today I asked to work on our relationship together and not doing the break because I felt like the break wasn‚Äôt fair to me and was harming me more than helping anyone. But he declined and so I ended the relationship. 

Before any of this we didn‚Äôt really have any problems and have been happy and healthy. He is a really great guy and this has all kind of caught me off guard. Is there anything to salvage in this relationship or should I just move on? Should I give reconciliation in the future a chance?",2019-07-08 00:00:06,4,0,relationship_advice
856,cadu5c,isthisright2,Am I (19F) falling out of love with my partner (19F) of 2+ years?,"Throwaway account. I've been really struggling with something for a while and don't know what exactly to do. Backstory is that I've been with my partner for over 2 years now and we recently got engaged. When we got engaged, I knew she was going to propose and was so scared I cried and tried to call it off. Then I got nervous and said she could do it anyway (I have anxiety and felt like it wouldn't be the same if I said not to propose, but after the post-engagement bliss period I got super nervous again). We had this spark from the beginning of our relationship and everything felt perfect up until I knew that that was going to happen. 

So we get engaged, get photos done, I buy a ring in return, and sometime in the middle of these few months we stopped having sex. Now (when I'm writing this), we literally have maybe had sex twice in the past 5-6 months. It makes me feel really uncomfortable and I have no desire to do it. In my mind I want to but when we're around each other I just don't feel anything. At first I thought it might be because of the depression medication I was on, so I talked to my psychiatrist, switched medicines, and ended up completely stopping them in May. It hasn't made anything better.

Come this June, I've been feeling more and more distant. I thought this was the person I wanted to marry for so long and we were perfect together and now it just feels so different. But I'm afraid that if we break up it would be a huge mistake. I even tried to take a break for a week and see how I felt but it was so hard to stop talking to her, we sucked at it. She's my best friend and I think it makes it even harder because it feels like if I don't have her I have no friends.

I've recently been thinking that maybe it's an ""I'm bisexual"" thing and I want to try stuff out (I've only dated girls since 2016). But I don't want to ruin a relationship based on curiosity. My whole family loves her and I feel so awful because I know I've been pushing her away and barely kissing or cuddling or anything. It's not fair to her for me to be unsure and keep her around without being 100% in it. I don't know what the best decision is and I'm scared to destroy my relationship with someone I love so dearly, whether that be as a friend or otherwise. Any advice welcome.

857,cadthl,throwaway15depressed,Do I(15M) have a crush on this girl(15F) I met on Reddit? I'm not sure if what I'm feeling is a crush or not.,"I do encourage you to read the whole thing to get the clear picture.

I'm asking because I'm not sure. I'll do my best to describe how I feel about her, and see what y'all think. Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

So, I have depression, I won't get into why, other posts explain that but it is moderate depression (non-suicidal).

I have no friends IRL, much less female friends. This is for multiple reasons out of my control.

So, I made a friend online about a month ago, she's cute and I have told her so multiple times as a compliment, at the time I was not at all trying to hit on her, that hadn't even crossed my mind. It was my way of being nice, I'd rather be honest than using a vague word like ""good"". She's really nice, had so much in common with me in terms of life experiences and personality in a way, she has called me sweet and always responded positively to my compliments. We live across the world, I in Thailand (I'm half-black, half-Japanese, not Thai), and her America. She has also said that she has seen my face picture I posted on my main account, and thinks I'm more than a 5/10 (at the time, my rating of myself, it's about a 6/10 now which I'm happy with). She likes my jokes, and even one time she said that my compliment made her blush. I always enjoy talking to her even for a little bit, I just feel some type of way, when she says something nice to me, when she leaves a little smiley face, one time I complimented her hair and she responded with the ""kiss"" emoji. I'm having some conflict in my mind because I can't tell if my feelings are just of friendship, or if it's just because of my lack of interaction with girls, or if it's really something more. Although, it's worth noting that I never felt this way for any other girl I've tried to or have befriended online. I have said that when I turn 18, I plan to go to America or Canada and maybe then we can actually talk for real, maybe even in person.

They have always had that very close twin relationship, and their husbands are great friends, even though Twin A and SIL A live about 3 hours away from the rest of our family. The 2 SILs (the other is M46) planned to go to a concert together in August, in addition to SIL A planning a surprise party for, well, we thought, both twins. 

Part of SIL A‚Äôs surprise was to bring in two of Twin A‚Äôs (and Twin B‚Äôs, though not as close) out-of-town friends (with spouses) one of whom they see only occasionally, and one whom they haven‚Äôt seen for 2 or 3 years. The only weekend the friends could come was the concert weekend. So SIL A forfeited the concert ticket he‚Äôd already paid for, planned the event, and never even actually invited Twin B to come. Adding insult to injury, SIL A asked Couple B to babysit their 6 year old child that weekend while Couple A has a birthday party, and SIL B goes to a concert with other friends. 

I learned all this from Couple B and they‚Äôve asked me to not say anything so Twin A won‚Äôt get hurt feelings, but Twin B is super hurt and Twin A doesn‚Äôt even know about all this drama. In fact, I‚Äôll bet Twin A will be hurt when Twin B doesn‚Äôt appear, and their mutual friends are going to think Twin B is a jerk for not being there. I love my SILs and we have a great family, but I‚Äôm a hothead, especially when it comes to my kids, regardless of their age, so I‚Äôm biting through my tongue. Also, I don‚Äôt think SIL A did anything to intentionally be hurtful,  but just didn‚Äôt think this through. Party plans and travel arrangements have been made, I‚Äôm under gag order, etc. Sigh. What does a silenced, PO‚Äôd mother do?",2019-07-07 23:55:39,7,0,relationship_advice
859,cads34,SlowSpaceJellyFish,Boyfriend (17M) doesn't know if he can be with me (17F) because he's religious and I'm not,"So I (17F) have been together with my boyfriend (17M) for over half a year. It's been going great. We have been friends for 3 year before we started dating as well, which was a great friendship. He's christian. I know that, and have known that for all the time I've known him, as well as he knows that I'm not religious.

Our relationship has been great. Open communcation, we talk about our problems, dissolve arguments, and said arguments always ends in a kiss and an ""I love you"". We share some of the same interest, and support those we don't share. It's probably worth mentioning that we basically dated for 6 months before it became official as well. We talk openly about our religious views, and that I don't refuse that there is a god, and that I have nothing against his beliefs, I support that he has something he believes in this strongly and finds safety and a community in.

This summer he went to a christian camp with his congregation, like he does each summer. He talks about this feeling of being very close to god, almost like being blessed, which always makes him very emotional. I can't really out myself in his shoes because I've never had that experience, but I belive him. After that, he started having doubts about our relationship, because on a daily basis he chooses to be with me instead of going to meetings with his congregation (every tuesday and sunday). Apparently hes had this on his mind for a long time, but just pushed it away.

After he started being unsure he almost stopped eating and cried a lot before talking to me over the phone. I've told him that if I knew about this earlier I'd tell him to go to his meeting, and that there are still five days left each weeks that we can be with eachother. He has a feeling that he needs to choose, and I've told him that he doean't have to. He doesn't want to lose that feeling of being close to god, because he often looses that during his day-to-day life. He's completely torn up in this, but I've told him to please not make a decition until we meet face-to-face (16/17. july).

He has talked a lot about how much he likes our relationship, how happy he is around me, and how much he doen't want to loose it. 

I don't want to tell him that I think that being with very religious people for over two weeks, and not being able to see or talk to me can skew his priorities a bit, as well as the whole ""group mentality"" thing. I really do not want to lose what we have, or him. He is the first person thats not my family that I've loved, and same goes for him.

&amp;#x200B;

We're going to talk again tomorrow. So, what do you think I should do or say, and are there andy religious people that are in a relationship with a non-religious person that can give me some insight? I'm really lost here",2019-07-07 23:52:47,14,0,relationship_advice
860,cadqyf,hutozizase,[24/M] Avoiding relationships out of fear of getting cheated on. What can I do to change?,"I never had much success with women. In fact, those who have been interested in me were always the ones making the first move. Thing is, I'm 24 now and getting my shit together. I want to share my life with someone and you know, raise a family, buy a house together, find a life-partner etc etc. 

A while ago I took a family law class in college and divorce rates/ infidelity rates were discussed(they kind of are linked who knew!!). Since then, I've been avoiding flirting, dating apps etc. I just don't want to experience what it's like being cheated on. 
I want to date yet I stop myself from doing it. I don't trust people anymore. And before you tell me ""well look at your past relationships..."" I've never had one. I don't have any reference points. I'm simply gun-shy about the whole dating process. Looking at the stats numbers is CERTAINLY not helping.

How could I change my mind so that I can have healthy relationships without having this crippling thought in my mind 24/7? Then, when getting in one, how do you put a seal on the thought of your partner straying?",2019-07-07 23:49:38,28,27,relationship_advice
861,cadqfx,IFuckingHurtInside,FOUND OUT MY HUSBAND WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR AND I JUST WANT TO DIE,"My husband (M26) and I (F26) are at our first duty station in Alaska (we got here one year ago) and our 2nd wedding anniversary is coming up next month in August. And he has already cheated on me. I feel dead inside. 

He is an LT so he is always very busy and had been on a lot of missions since we have been here. He had a training in California the entire month of February. This is where he met her, she is an LT from another unit in Alaska but in a different town hours and hours away thankfully. He was tasked to work with her the entire month and apparently they just talked non stop about everything under the sun. At this same time he was telling me that talking to me just made him miss me more so he wasn't texting me much. When he first told me about her, he said that she kind of reminded him of me and that I would like her. When his mission was done and I picked him up to come home he told me that she said she would leave her fiance for him. He told me that he was furious when she texted him that and he told her he didn't know how she got that impression and that he has a wife who has always been there for him. I said that something must have happened if she thought that way. His response was that they just talked a lot and one day during the end of training they shared a blanket when talking with other LTs. Apparently it was cold and he was shivering. She kept offering to share the blanket and he kept declining. Eventually she just threw it over him and they were both under it together. He said she kept moving closer and then he would scoot away. He said he didn't know if he was imagining this so to test her, he bumped his hand against her and then she bumped it back. He said at this point he got up and left because of what she was trying to do. 

I was so crushed when he told me this. How could he share a blanket with someone else? How could he choose to not talk to me as much as he could have but choose to talk to her non stop. He offered to go to couples counseling but I didn't think it was needed because he said he didn't have feelings for her. I just told him I didn't want him talking to her because she obviously wants to be more than friends. 

At the end of March we had a ball to attend where she was as well. It fucking sucked having to see her and I could feel her watching us. Every time my husband and I walked away from our friends for even a few minutes she would go over to them and start talking to them. I knew three people there and she knew hundreds yet she wouldn't leave my friend group alone. 

A few weeks later my husband had to go down to her base for a mission for a week. I asked if he had to work with her and he said no. When I he was down there I asked again and if he saw her and I said no. I asked again when he go back and he said no.  A couple weeks after that he had to go back for another week long mission and the same questions and answers were asked and given. A week after that he had another mission but this one was only for two days. After he got back from this mission I knew something felt wrong. I confronted him the next morning and asked if he was still talking to her, I figured he was going to say no but he said yes. I kept asking questions over and over and he would finally answer them. The first mission he had been tasked with he had to work with her again and so they had been talking a week beforehand to set things up. They had met up every single night for all three of those missions. On the last mission they fooled around, they didn't have sex but she asked and he said no. 

I died that day. I felt every part of my body just shatter. He held me while I cried and he cried too. I told him that he needed to block her number if we were going to try and work on things. A couple weeks later I had a horrible feeling in my gut so I checked his phone while he was in the shower. He had continued to talk to her through WhatsApp as she has recently deployed. I took his phone and left the house to read all of the messages. They were filled with poetry to each other and her telling him that she thinks we can work things out, but them contradicting herself and telling him that shes in love with him. I came back home and he arrived shortly after since he had been out looking for me. I started packing a suitcase to leave him and the look of shock on his face when he saw this will always surprise me. What did he think was going to happen? He begged me not to leave and cried so hard he puked. I told him the only way I would stay is if he made a counseling appointment that same day before noon. This was all on his birthday at the end of May. I feel bad that it happened on his birthday but it's ultimately his fault. 

We are currently talking to someone but I just feel so fucking hurt and I just want the pain to go away. I think about how being dead sounds so much better than being alive right now. I think about not being with him and what my life would be like and all I see is myself drinking nonstop and slowly killing myself. 

My husband and I met our freshman year of college and we're good friends. We didn't start dating until our senior year (2014) but we finally admitted that he had a soft spot for me. We graduated and moved 2 hours from family for a job I got. I supported him trying different jobs and deciding not to go get his master's. I just wanted him to be happy. He was in the national guard since college and he realized the army was the only job really making him happy at this point. We discussed and he decided to go active duty, which has lead us here. 

I have always supported my husband, I fucking helped him stop drinking and this is how he repays me. I sold my car, stopped advancing in my career path so he could advance in his and moved away from all of my family and friends. I have kept the house clean, done all of the dishes and cleaning, cooked all of the meals and taken care of the dogs. I've spent so much time supporting him and waiting for him when he has to leave and this is how he repays me. 

I know it's going to take a long time to feel better but I just can't understand how someone can do this to someone they say they love and will always love no matter what. He said that it wasn't how I think it was - that they were just friends but I don't think that's how she saw it at all. I keep thinking that I must have been a horrible person in my past life to deserve all of the bad that has happened to me. I constantly think about what I would say to her if I saw her - I want to tell her that the pain she has caused me makes the pain my rapist caused me to feel like nothing. That she is a horrible excuse for a human and a fool to call herself a religious person who thinks she can decide when God judges her or not.

I wrote this last month just to get my feelings out:

I can't seem to remember any of the happy moments in my life anymore. Everything is clouded over with shadows of depression and hopelessness. Feeling of being worthless and not good enough no matter how hard I tried. There is a sense of empending doom that takes over all of my thoughts and brings out the worst in me. My thoughts are filled with hate, revenge, and violence. So much so, that it scares me sometimes.  Every painful event that has occurred in my life, every hurdle that I thought I had overcome has surfaced because of you and want you did. I'm back at square one but lacking the optimistic mindset that I once proudly held onto. 

My entire body is in pain. My insides feel like they are torturously being ripped apart. The mixture of feeling as if I have been punched in the stomach without warning and the need to vomit are constant. Moments throughout the day when these feeling seem to dissapate are instantly shattered as if I have been punched again and I have to physically catch by breath.",2019-07-07 23:48:14,9,1,relationship_advice

My (25M) long-time GF‚Äôs (24F) sister (20‚Äôs F) got pregnant in high school and has a daughter (6F), and my GF absolutely adores her. And I do too, she‚Äôs very funny and smart and cute.

The problem is I have no idea how to talk to or play with her. She‚Äôs very well-behaved so there‚Äôs no issue there, but left to our own devices I don‚Äôt know what to say to her or how to connect with her. She‚Äôs extremely important to my GF so I feel like I need to bond with her but I genuinely don‚Äôt know how to talk to children.

865,cadooz,idkwhatmd0ing,I [F20s] am not sure what action to take on my SOs[F20s] and I‚Äôs behalf?,"Alright, so some backstory.

My SO and I met at work, have known each other for going on 4 years now. Our relationship didn‚Äôt begin the smoothest but it‚Äôs doing well and prospering. I‚Äôve always lived strictly by the ‚Äúnever dip your pen in the company ink‚Äù whatever, yadda yadda, but after helping her through tough spots in her life, I ended up just along for the ride. Definitely not complaining.

Anyways, we keep it professional at work, the typical conversations by the water dispenser, asking each other for the paperwork we require to do our jobs, ect. I can be a goofy asshole but that‚Äôs also with my friend, who is KNOWN at work for being my friend (we‚Äôll call him mark) since middle school, so it‚Äôs not just my SO who I‚Äôll rib with.

So the actual issue is when we started dating 2 years ago I was a supervisor, and like the assistant to our Big Boss. So it was a big deal but not like a BIG one that we were dating, as long as we kept low profile. Then the Big Boss promoted my SO, ditched, and I took the Boss‚Äô spot. Okay that‚Äôs when it started being an issue. So now Mark, my SO, another chick who is my assistant and myself are all supervisors with me being in charge.

My assistant is telling me she‚Äôs hearing that some of our employees are whispering that they think my SO and I are dating. When I asked on what grounds my assistant said because I bicker/joke with my SO. I also joke with my assistant and Mark, so it doesn‚Äôt seem fair, especially when the only person who is out is my SO. Both of us are ‚Äústraight-passing‚Äù so this is troubling as I know my Regional Manager is homophobic and that‚Äôs the last thing I‚Äôd need is my whole section thinking I‚Äôm fraternizing with my employee who is also a woman. 

I also feel like this happened because Mark is very social and has let several of our employees follow him on social media. This wasn‚Äôt an issue until recently, and after he did one of our employees approached my girlfriend jokingly asking if we were dating simply because we follow each other on Instagram (but our profiles are both private??). Which they wouldn‚Äôt even have known that much if he listened to my simple request.

So I‚Äôm torn because I‚Äôm frustrated with my friend because I told him multiple times about making friends with the whole department and that he can‚Äôt move up when people know him as The Nice Guy On Instagram, and then my SO is frustrated bc she feels like I‚Äôm hard enough on her at work and it‚Äôs unfair people to think she‚Äôs being given any kind of leeway. 

After hearing about this she‚Äôs worried I‚Äôm going to be more aggressive about work and she already complains that I don‚Äôt even try to take it easy. But I‚Äôve told my entire team I take work seriously and just want the job done, and hearing that our employees have time to gossip about us is just further frustrating me. I feel like it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a woman, and honestly if I were in my previous position I would‚Äôve called HR.

I tried asking my assistant to tell me who thinks talking of that sort of stuff is acceptable and she won‚Äôt tell me. So I‚Äôm at a loss of what I can do to neutralize the situation, besides bringing a random person into my job and ‚Äúmentioning‚Äù that they‚Äôre my actual SO. 

But I feel like it‚Äôs honestly no ones business so?? I‚Äôm at a loss lmao",2019-07-07 23:43:26,4,0,relationship_advice
866,cadont,danilarson,I (F 23) am unsure if I should talk to my boyfriend ( M 27) about issues I‚Äôm having with him... his personality,"Let me preface this by saying I‚Äôm his first girlfriend so he doesn‚Äôt have any experience with regards to dating. I‚Äôve been dating my boyfriend for 2 years, moved into his house a year ago. There are things I love about him: work ethic, means well when talking to people, wants to learn/ know things and he‚Äôs an overall angel to me when I‚Äôm down etc.

However, there are things I am not attracted to. I have been hesitating to say that it is apart of his personality. 

He talks in a baby voice sometimes, or just talks unintelligent on purpose such as ‚Äúoh dats a big twuck‚Äù or stuff like that. I think he tries to be funny but it honestly turns me off so I ignore it or just acknowledge his comments and move on because ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs just him being him‚Äù.  But I think the things he says in that way is immature.

His humor isn‚Äôt like mine. It can be very sarcastic. I‚Äôll give an example ‚Äúoh why don‚Äôt I just jump off a bridge and my problems will go away‚Äù or, ‚ÄúI think this guy should just go fuck himself‚Äù and i guess I don‚Äôt think of laughing at it but I know he‚Äôs trying to be funny.

Lastly he strokes his ego a lot. As a psychology major I see he does this quite a bit but in a joking way. It makes me a little uneasy and it just bothers me that he tries to build himself up sometimes. Sometimes I call him out on it but he‚Äôs ‚Äújust joking‚Äù.

Overall he‚Äôs immature in some aspects and I‚Äôm sure he can depict me of things I say it‚Äôs just been going on for as long as I‚Äôve known him and I‚Äôm turned off by it. I love him but I feel like I‚Äôm not so fully in love because of these aspects.

868,cadns4,ihateflyingthings,Elderly family member becoming controlling. Need advice for balance of needs.,"Without going into HIPPA violations, I have to keep this a bit vague. My apologies. 

I moved a family member in awhile back because I was concerned for their wellbeing. We‚Äôve had the conversation where I‚Äôve asked them to not make demands, but ask instead. In the form of a question, a request. 

I respond to requests gleefully, they know this, it‚Äôs been established. I do not respond well to demands, I ask Socratic questions to get them to understand the way my mind works when they try to make demands. They seem to get it. All has been good. 

Lately, I‚Äôve been on the job hunt, I have two solid leads and the family members‚Äô first question was about how I can take care of them while working? Which job I take will be better for them? They‚Äôre not thinking about my needs at all. 

They lied to me about their‚Äô care needs and said they needed about 5 hours a week. This isn‚Äôt the case, they are in fact nearly wheelchair bound. It‚Äôs more like ~20 hours a week if you factor everything in. 

Now that you have the background info, should I cave in and work the less paying job with less hours that benefits them more. Or should I go with the higher paying job that takes away from the hours they want me to do for them and gives me more free time and freedom?

It‚Äôs a tricky situation, I can set up a schedule for either scenario, but I need money and to have a life. If I take the higher paying job, family member gets less care, but not much. If I take the lower paying job, I‚Äôm miserable and can‚Äôt have much of a life. 

I know what I‚Äôm going to do, I thought I‚Äôd see if anyone else has been in this situation that can give some insightful advice. 

I told the family member about my medical condition that sometimes makes me reclusive and sometimes social. It‚Äôs called omnivert. I‚Äôm both an introvert and an extrovert. It varies. Family member just tried to say ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just an excuse for your selfish behavior‚Äù aka, a reason to not cater to their needs as much. 

How do I deal with a family member that demands my time over my happiness, what do I say?

I‚Äôm lost, please help. All advice is welcome. Thank you in advance. 

P.S. These jobs are pending interviews in the next three days. I may take both and burn myself out. But at least I‚Äôd get caught up on financial obligations.",2019-07-07 23:40:51,8,9,relationship_advice
869,cadnne,FarmerBoy22,Wife won‚Äôt help,"I‚Äôll keep this short as I‚Äôm on mobile but my [33m] wife [34f] always does things on her schedule.  This is what happened today. 

Last night We agree that we‚Äôll go to the zoo at 11am tomorrow morning (meaning today)Which means she needs to get up at 8am to have breakfast, shower, do her half of the chores, get the 2yo ready and get out the door by 11am. Makes sense right???  

Well....she, frequently, decides she is tired at 8am (I‚Äôm already up btw) so she hits snooze. I wake her up at 8:15pm. She says she‚Äôs tired and to wake her up at 9pm. But that‚Äôll push us back until noon. Okay fine. That‚Äôs not the end of the world. 

9am come around. Still tired but wakes up. Not get up. Wakes up and plays with her phone until 9:30am and then gets up and spends 15 min making the bed. Comes downstairs.  Checks on her 50 gal fish city for a few mins. Then goes into our bathroom for 45 mins. 

It‚Äôs around 10:45 at this point.  Mind you we agreed to leave at 11am. I ask if she‚Äôs about ready. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt even showered.‚Äù  I‚Äôm really frustrated at this point because that means at least another hour of shower, makeup, finding an outfit. (Picture stereotypical 17 year old in the movies going to ‚Äúthe big dance‚Äù.  That‚Äôs how long it‚Äôll take.  Also, WTF has she been doing for 45 mins because she doesn‚Äôt have her makeup with her. 

She finishes getting ready and it‚Äôs noon at this point. I‚Äôm thinking great we are about ready to go. Nope. She wants breakfast now. I say ‚Äúsorry. You‚Äôll have to toast a bagel or something and eat on the go because we will eventually run into our sons nap or worst deal with an overtired 2yo in public. 

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt eat on the road. It‚Äôs uncomfortable for me.‚Äù She says. ‚ÄúWell than you don‚Äôt eat or we don‚Äôt go to the zoo because we can‚Äôt wait here for you to eat an go to the zoo. We don‚Äôt have time.‚Äù  I say. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not fair. You got to eat breakfast.‚Äù She says. ‚ÄúWell.....we got up on time and ate.‚Äù  Needless yo day she didn‚Äôt eat and decided to go as the zoo is more for our son than us. But she was pissed. 

At this point in this story you may have forgot the chores that needed to be done. So here is the breakdown since she was behind I also did her share:

Me: get dressed, get son changed(diaper and going out clothes (no pjs)), make us breakfast. Let‚Äôs the dogs out, feed the fish, feed the turtles (2 water tanks and 1 land terrarium), feed the bird, let the dogs in to eat and drink, pack sandwiches in the cooler for lunch with ice packs and drinks, make sure we have first aid stuff like band aides, benedryll(wife is allergic to bees), etc, pack up the car with all of that, put the dogs away, and make sure I have money, cell phone, and drive ID (I don‚Äôt leave this in my car at night)

Her: get dressed, get showered. 

The point of my story is how can I get through to my wife that i feel frustrated by doing almost All of the work almost everyday that I‚Äôm getting burnt out with working a full time job and she stays as home?  I‚Äôve brought this up a few times and I get told I‚Äôm ‚Äúover exaggerating‚Äù, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not true‚Äù, or she just simply says ‚Äúokay and what would you like me to do about it?‚Äù To which I say to ‚Äúhelp out in the morning or take a morning from me now and then to give me a break‚Äù.  All of these do nothing and she doesn‚Äôt change.

870,cadnl5,deathsultimatestan,Bitter over father's preference for half sister(22F) that he hid from me (20F),"Long story short: lived with parents my until they divorced two years ago, now I'm with my mother. Father was making plenty of money but very stingy with it. During the divorce it was revealed I had a half-sister all along from a previous relationship. When I came across her Facebook profile, she'd been tagged in pictures with him when I never had even been mentioned. Was widely loved by his side of the family, while they were distant with me. Mom also told me he was generous with money with her, paying her full university tuition and giving her extra allowance for other things she needed, practically whatever. Meanwhile, now that we're separated, I haven't heard a word from him, and he's been evading paying any sort of money, so I've had to put on debt to pay for school. 

It feels like a joke, after I was the one all these years trying to mend our relationship, like I'm not even his daughter. He brought this on himself by being abusive, both physically and verbal, and never having tried to bond with me even for a moment. That why the divorce happened, his endless abuse.

We‚Äôve gone out a couple of times and everything is super great, i like her a lot and she likes me but she‚Äôs had a bunch of boyfriends over the years and a lot more experience than me.

I‚Äôve only ever had 1 other girlfriend that lasted less than a month and needless to say I‚Äôm still a virgin, she really likes me but she‚Äôs always mentioning her exes and telling me about them and I absolutely hate it.

I don‚Äôt have anything against her for liking other people and I know I shouldn‚Äôt have a reason to, but it bothers me a whole lot that she mentions them, makes me feel like I‚Äôm just another guy, that many other guys kissed her and hugged her and probably liked her a lot more than I do and she probably compares them to me. Even more so when it comes if I‚Äôll even have a chance to have relations with her, I love her but just the simple idea of her with other men and probably me not being able to compare to them terrifies me.

I shouldn‚Äôt think about this and I don‚Äôt have the right to be angry  about this since she had every right to be with other people, and I absolutely like her, but I don‚Äôt know what to do about this.

She‚Äôs super nice too, it‚Äôs not like she goes out with a new guy every week or something like that, but I feel like she might be easy to fall for people and her liking me will just last a month or so.

873,cadlu4,Throwaway1643275159,I don‚Äôt want to hate my Ex.,"Recently I got broken up with after 5 years. I got told that there were little things that I didn‚Äôt improve and that she just wasn‚Äôt satisfied with her life or our relationship. I originally left for an hour to cool off and then returned and tried to talk to her and fix everything. She kept saying things weren‚Äôt going right and something felt off. I asked her if there is someone else and she said no, it‚Äôs her choice. 
I left our place for two days and returned but she was at a party until 3 am. We talked and she basically said she had feelings for someone else. As days went by she kept spending time with that someone else. As I tried my best to talk and try and come up with solutions, I took her to the hospital since she felt sick, I cleaned the living room and made her breakfast and took care of her due to her cold. Because I loved her so much. She kept saying she needed time and that she didn‚Äôt want to be with anyone. She said maybe she‚Äôll feel different and we could make it work but I told her it‚Äôd be too late. She said she couldn‚Äôt be with someone right now and I told her that means she‚Äôll end up with him. I was right. She at one point stayed with this other person for two whole days. Within 3 weeks she already basically claimed they were kind of a thing. 
I had left our place. She threw everything away, emotionally speaking. But also all the gifts I gave her, all the acts of love, they all feel like like they didn‚Äôt mean shit. I wanted the life we talked about. She just said she moved on because she had been feeling this way. But I asked her if she wanted to break up around 4 weeks before she broke up and she told me no. She thought things would get better since we moved from living at my parents to our own little place. But a month in she decided it wasn‚Äôt going to get better and she never talked to me about it. She admitted she should have but now it‚Äôs too late. I poured my heart into someone and she threw me away. I don‚Äôt want to hate my ex but I can‚Äôt see how I can move on.",2019-07-07 23:35:39,2,2,relationship_advice
874,cadlg9,fmamfjwmd,My boyfriend of 2 years does not want me to go on a family trip.,"Important edit: My boyfriend and I are young, both 20. So he isn‚Äôt a bum who hasn‚Äôt gotten his life together or whatever like my parents say. He moved in with my family a few months after he turned 18. 

I‚Äôm torn. We‚Äôve been together for 2 years and live together. My boyfriend and my family don‚Äôt have the best relationship. My mother allowed him to live with us when his narcissistic grandma kicked him out. She kicked him out because his room was dirty (proven, I was with him when she texted him and told him she changed the locks and he wasn‚Äôt allowed back because of it) but obviously there‚Äôs many more reasons why she was terrible. His room was not disgustingly dirty, it was averagely disorganized. For example, clothes laying around and an unmade bed. 

Anyways, my boyfriend has always been respectful and kind. When he would come over before he moved in, he would always do what my mom asked. If she asked him to take he laundry up both flights of stairs, take it all the garbage, etc. he‚Äôd do it, even though he was only at my house once or twice at this point. 

When he moved in; it only escalated. She took advantage of his kindness and was just as narcissistic as his grandma if he didn‚Äôt do it. It eventually started stretching towards me as well, and kind of damaged my relationship with her because of how she treated him. We have since moved out and our relationship has become better now that there are no conflicts like my boyfriend and I not wanting to do whatever she says.

Basically, she would tell him to take up 5 heavy bushels of clothes (enough clothes for 6 people), take out two large garbage cans down a very long driveway, take in all of the groceries by himself, etc. She basically treated him like a servant. Her excuse was that he wasn‚Äôt paying rent so he had to do whatever she wanted. Which we understand to some extent, we understand he had to contribute. But she took him living with us as an opportunity to make him do all of the work for everyone in the house (6 people). She did not ask my siblings to do any work. We we‚Äôre very resentful. Of course I helped because I wasn‚Äôt going to let my boyfriend do this work alone. Also, if he didn‚Äôt do it exactly when she wanted, we would be yelled at terribly among many other things. There wasn‚Äôt a day where we were stressed. 

Also, he has a bad relationship with my grandparents. He‚Äôs always been respectful of them, but they looked down on him. They‚Äôre very judgmental. He‚Äôs black, they‚Äôre white. They‚Äôre prejudiced and would see him as a bum because he didn‚Äôt have a car, job, etc., like that‚Äôs so much easier than it was in 1930. They would also bang on our bedroom door and say very rude things to us. Among many, many more things. So he began to avoid them completely. I did too but we made amends after I began to fully defend my boyfriend and not make excuses.

Fast forward to now, we‚Äôre in our own apartment. There‚Äôs a huge family reunion a few states away. I don‚Äôt work, he does. I never expected him to go because of the reasons above. The ENTIRE SIDE of my mom‚Äôs family is going. My sisters, my mom, her boyfriend, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. Even distant cousins who I only ever see at things like this. I‚Äôve known about this since last month. The reunion is at the end of this month. Everyone is asking me if I‚Äôm going and telling me all the reasons I should. 

I really want to. I want to see my family! But I understand my boyfriend will probably never be comfortable with them again, after everything he‚Äôs experienced with them. I want to go for just a few days, and everyone is staying for up to two weeks. I will be the only person not going. 

I‚Äôm so torn. I want to be on my boyfriends side about this. He claims I have no reason to go since my family ‚Äúnever does anything for me‚Äù his reasons are they‚Äôll never pay my bills, never make sure I‚Äôm not struggling financially, etc. I think those are bullshit excuses for why I shouldn‚Äôt go. But his family is like that though. I just don‚Äôt expect my great uncles and aunts and cousins to be paying my bills or giving me money.. I want to see them just because.. 

This trip will also be completely payed for. Besides things I personally want to buy, my hotel and transportation is covered by my grandparents. They have even offered to pay for him but I know he‚Äôll never come. I understand that. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel so lost because every time I talk to a family member, they ask me if I‚Äôm going. I want to say yes but I don‚Äôt want my boyfriend to feel like I chose the side of people who have hurt him. Also, my boyfriend isn‚Äôt comfortable being here by himself. He has trouble sleeping alone and gets paranoid easily and I help him by just being with him. It isn‚Äôt a burden on me or anything, but I do know he has to grow out of that because when days like this comes, he‚Äôll have to be alone. I‚Äôm the same way though, I can‚Äôt sleep good unless someone else in the same room as me. Or at least if someone else is in the house and is awake and I can hear them. I don‚Äôt like being the last one awake, and I absolutely can‚Äôt sleep when I‚Äôm home alone. Basically we have trouble sleeping, period. 

So I desperately need outside opinions. I live only 90 mins away from my mom, dad, grandparents, aunt, and siblings. The train ticket is about $10. I can see them whenever. But as for my cousins and long distance relatives, I‚Äôll see them at least once a year. Always on Christmas for my cousins, but everyone else, it has to be something big like this. I‚Äôm not as close with them but they‚Äôre still family and I‚Äôd like to see them. 

TLDR: Overall, my boyfriends reasoning for him not wanting me to go is 1. They don‚Äôt help me when I‚Äôm struggling. 2. Why do I need to go to visit family if they barely talk to me. 3. He doesn‚Äôt want to be alone 

Sidenote: I don‚Äôt feel like he‚Äôs intentionally trying to trap me or anything, I just feel like he doesn‚Äôt fully understand my point of view because of how my family has treated him. I it I‚Äôm biased because they‚Äôre family.

Edit: Let me be more clear on how my grandparents are prejudiced. They hold most stereotypes to most black people. Like if they see someone standing on the corner of the street they‚Äôll say ‚Äúhey look, there‚Äôs a drug dealer‚Äù or if they see a black person walking they‚Äôll say ‚Äúthis is why you need to go to college, so you won‚Äôt be walking and riding a bike everywhere‚Äù. They‚Äôre very judgement and make assumptions. My siblings and I (who are 50% black) always correct them when we are around. But they are very set in their ways and continue these comments. They‚Äôve said implying things directly to my boyfriend but it mainly just came off as rude rather than racist. This is another reason why my boyfriend is uncomfortable around them.",2019-07-07 23:34:37,8,1,relationship_advice

(21F) (25M),"So we knew each other a couple years ago from work and mutual friends but recently re-connected over this dating app. We went out once which was nice. It felt very friendly and pretty much just caught up and had fun. The second time we hung out was with his friends at a party.

A lot of people commented on how we should date and how we go well together. At this point I was really unsure of my feelings but after we made out that night I was sure I didn't want this to be a relationship.

Our chemistry is great, we support each others dreams, his friends are awesome but I'm not attracted to him or emotionally invested romantically.

Now I know this might be an overreaction over just two dates but I've never done the whole dating thing and since we've known each before this, texting/calling saying ""I'm not interested"" just doesn't sit right with me. I really want him in my life still (I know that might not happen) and I just want to handle it in the best way.

I was thinking over coffee? We live a bit far from each other but I feel like doing it over text is sending the message that I don't respect him or our friendship.",2019-07-07 23:34:09,1,1,relationship_advice

877,cadkvl,bleedingwriter,Friend M(30) is getting anonymous messages that his GF (F21) is cheating on him. I (m32) dont know how to help him,"For clarity we will call my friend Wade and his gf Julie

This post really isnt about whether Julie cheating on Wade or not, or maybe it is (I'm in the belief that Julie is, but it's not my relationship). I'm a bit biased. I've been cheated on in all but one of my relationships. This is wades first relationship. 

Theres definitely an issue of maturity here. When they first started going out, about a year ago, Julie was bragging to us about all the guys she cheated on, one of them just weeks prior to dating Wade, and proceeded to say ""you're different though""

A few months ago one of Wades friends, bob, told him that a friend of Bob's was having relations with Julie. Apparently Bob's friend was an old flings of Julie's. Wade kind of believed him, but proceeded to tell Julie. Julie didnt say anything and later that week Julie snuck into Wade's phone and blocked Bob on all forms of contact.

Cut to now.

Theres this person anonymously messaging Wade now stating that Julie is cheating on him. The first message was just asking Wade if Julie was his girlfriend. Before any other messages were exchanged Julie told Wade to just block the anonymous messenger.

Except Wade didnt. Wade heard the person out, who refused to say who he was or offer proof. So wade decided to block this person.

Now this person is adding him on every form of media trying to get in contact and Wade just keeps blocking the requests.

My friend keeps asking for advice from me, and I dont think I should outright tell him to break up. He knows I think he should, but it's not my relationship.

I'm biased. I'm trying to help him. Hes going to stay with her, despite how bad it probably is. He thinks someone is just trying to start stuff. But do people honestly do that? Other than just being supportive what else should I do. I just got the most recent update about the requests on other forms of media last night and was cringing hard. But I need to help my friend. I just dont know how.",2019-07-07 23:32:59,6,1,relationship_advice
878,cadksu,insecurethrowaway93,I [26F] feel like he [29M] doesn‚Äôt really care about spending time with me and might be losing interest. Am I reading too much into this?,"  

My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 2 months but have known each other and were friends for a while prior. At the start it was perfect ‚Äì we were inseparable, he was super affectionate, we saw eye to eye on so many things, the sex was the best either of us have ever had, he asked me to be his girlfriend, and all signs pointed to this being the start of something good. He then he abruptly became distant and unaffectionate. He finally talked to me about it around 3 weeks ago and basically said he‚Äôs unsure what he wants, has some uncertainty about the genuineness of his feelings for me and got freaked out by how open and candid he was with me with his feelings. We decided to keep giving this a shot though because he was pretty certain he likes me, and I certainly like him.

Everything felt good for about a week and a half after we talked, but it since feels like it‚Äôs slowly fading to him being distant again. One issue is that he lives with his dad (he moved to the state recently) and hasn‚Äôt told his family about us yet for various reasons, so we can‚Äôt hang out when his dad is in town. He‚Äôs been out of town less and less lately, and while BF has asked me to go to movies with him a couple times to hang out, he‚Äôs dodged my attempts to invite him back to my apartment for a little bit of intimacy. I also had told him that while his dad is around he‚Äôs always welcome to invite himself over to my place, even if it‚Äôs for intimacy (we‚Äôve done a couple of ‚Äúbooty calls‚Äù in the past, including when his dad was in town, so this isn‚Äôt unprecedented) and he ignored the message and hasn‚Äôt taken me up on it. It‚Äôs been just about 2 weeks since we‚Äôve had sex, or cuddled, or done anything besides a quick hug and a kiss.

It‚Äôs also hard because all the verbal affection is gone from our messaging each other ‚Äì he was the catalyst behind us using kiss emojis and sending cute messages and whatnot at the start, and now he‚Äôs completely stopped it and won‚Äôt reciprocate when I do it. When we don‚Äôt get to see each other much like right now, it‚Äôs hard when our only avenue of interaction feels very platonic. Everything honestly just feels very platonic right now coming from him, and I feel like if he truly cared he‚Äôd make some kind of effort to see me one-on-one so we can, y‚Äôknow, act like we‚Äôre in a relationship and do the things you would do.

With his uncertainty that he‚Äôs expressed and lack of effort to see me in an intimate capacity, I‚Äôm starting to wonder if this is doomed and I don‚Äôt really know what to do.

**Tl;dr** boyfriend and I started off amazing, then he became distant because he was unsure of his feelings for me and unsure of what he wanted. We decided to give this a shot, and everything felt really good for a bit, but now the only way he‚Äôll hang out is if we go out and he‚Äôs not making an effort to come over to my place to see me (he currently lives with his dad and he‚Äôs keeping the relationship hidden for various reasons right now).

879,cadizu,SluttyLilSchoolGirl,My (18F) Fwb (18M) has upset two of my closest friends and I‚Äôm caught in the middle,"As I‚Äôm typing i realised this is gonna get confusing really quick so a code
Sluttylilshoolgirl - me
Chandler - fwb
Monica - friend 1
Phoebe - friend 2 
Rachel - fwb‚Äôs ex hookup


It‚Äôs kind of a long story. I‚Äôll try and keep it short, me and Chandler have been friends for the best part of two years but just started hooking up. Before me he hooked up with another girl, Rachel, who my friends happen to not like (she has had a history of stirring drama with my friend Monica and flirting with her boyfriend in the past). Phoebe also saw Rachel flirting with Monica‚Äôs boyfriend before an exam and told Monica. Rachel found out because Chandler told her what Phoebe said and she started posting passive aggressive stories on Instagram and messaging Phoebe asking why she did it. Chandler also said to Rachel someone told him to get with me over her because Rachel ‚Äúgets around‚Äù. This other person was not Monica, but Monica is being blamed and is understandably pissed at Chandler. Now Phoebe and Monica refuse to be in the same room or go to an event where Chandler is (which is awkward because he‚Äôs kind of in our friendship group) and hate him completely. 

This is still raw as this all kicked off on Wednesday and I‚Äôm hoping will blow over to the point where they might be civil at least. So my question is, what do I do now? My friends haven‚Äôt said they have a problem with me continuing to hook up with Chandler, but I feel like a bad friend for continuing to do so. Another third party, let‚Äôs call him Ross, said I should carry on and that my friends will understand I‚Äôm not doing it to upset them, but I‚Äôm unsure. The thing is, we don‚Äôt know when Chandler told Rachel all this as this is bringing up events from April and a month ago so it‚Äôs not impossible Rachel has been sitting on this for a while and picked her moment now. I‚Äôm seeing Chandler tomorrow and plan to talk to him then to get his side. I don‚Äôt know what to do reddit, am I a bad friend if I were to continue to hook up with him or because I am technically not involved in the drama am I ok to carry on. I really like the way things are now and hope they can carry on but I really care about my friends and don‚Äôt want them to hate me for it.

From what she told me, it was completely mutual but her bf messaged me and told me the opposite. Should I tell my friend that her bf texted me and abt the conversation?","Throwaway acct. Just like the title. The names below are not real names. 

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend  (Jane) and her bf (Daniel) are leaving each other at the end of the, mostly bc her bf is leaving to another state for grad school but i get the feeling she just got tired of him bc she's been hanging around and talking to a different guy more and more often. Jane told me how they were ending things around 1.5ish weeks ago and i thought nothing of it since it seemed like they were both okay with it. But once Daniel messaged, he made her seem like them breaking up was something Jane selfishly wanted on her own. Daniel told me how he didn't approve of the guy Jane started hanging out with (Justin)  and how he didn't mind having an LDR but to him it didn't seem like Jane was on board with the idea. I was kind of shocked bc while Jane didn't tell me all the details (i didn't want to press her), i thought things were cleared up between them. He also told me how Justin and Jane argue a lot and how Justin does specific things to get Jane's attention. I don't know Justin that well and i havent met him yet, but Jane made him out to be an okay kind of guy so i don't really know who to believe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Jane has realized that something is wrong bc she keeps texting and facetiming Daniel but Daniel is either giving one word responses or just says that ""i'm busy i'll call you back later"" (he doesn't call back). I'm not sure if i should tell her that Daniel messaged me about how he feels on the whole situation bc that would be betraying Daniel's trust but at the same time I feel like Jane needs to know what Daniel said to me because they obviously aren't on the same page.

TL;DR - my best friend and her bf are breaking up at the end of the month. Friend told me ending things was mutual. Bf messaged me and said it wasn't (called my best friend selfish).

885,cadg9t,bubbletea999,He said he needed more time - was he being honest or just stringing me along?,"I 21\[F\] dated this guy \[24M\] for 6 months. During these 6 months, we were both heavily caught up in other things. He traveled a lot and was very preoccupied with work (he works in healthcare) and I had to invest a lot of time in school for some periods. For this reason, we would meet once every two weeks, sometimes 3.   


We were exclusive but were not officially boyfriend and girlfriend. We had some minor problems (him not putting in the effort to communicate) and I've brought them up, he would immediately put effort into changing his habits - I could sense his fear of losing me. Despite this, I was always uncertain about how he felt about me because when I asked him where he sees this going (midway through our relationship), he didn't have a clear answer. He said that because we don't spend that much time together, he needs more time to figure out if this is something serious. Knowing him as a person, he is very analytical, planned and cautious. One part of me thinks that he really does need more time to figure out his feelings, but another part of me thinks that he doesn't want a relationship with me and is just stringing me along.   


I would like to add that we do have a good emotional connection and our relationship wasn't based on hooking up because I told him I only engaged in sex with people I'm officially dating. So I don't know if he would have considered this an FWB situation.   


Now we decided to not see each other. But I'm questioning whether I made the right choice (by not seeing someone who isn't sure about me) or if I rushed this decision because of pressures to commit.

887,cadf8g,kkosos,A great relationship done just like that. Me (20M) dumped by girlfriend (20F). Need advice,"My GF \[F20\] dumped me \[M20\] almost 5 weeks ago. We were together for about 5/6 months. I know that may not be a long time for many of you, but this was my first committed relationship and first time I had fallen in love.

Our relationship was very good. We wouldn't fight, we were very happy together, and talked about the future with each other. I had spent time with her friends and family. They all liked me and I liked them.

Our last day as a couple was very good, I spent time with her and her friends. I had no feelings that she was going to breakup with me as she was as intimate with me as usual and said she was looking forward to seeing me later that week.

We saw eachother later that week, it was about 6 days later because we were busy. During those 6 days I had an odd feeling that we were going to break up. I couldn't explain it, it was just a gut feeling that she was going to dump me. She was less responsive in text than usual, but there was no clear reason for her to break up with me that I could think of so I brushed it off.

She dumped me when I saw her that day. She at first was saying that we couldn't go on like how we were going, that we dont see each other much and that it wasn't good for me. I said I was happy and provided a solution to see each other more but she kept saying how it wouldn't be fair to me. I was pretty tired of this roundabout way of breaking up with me so I told her to tell me the real reason.

She said that she couldn't love me like I loved her. (this was her first committed relationship as well) She said that this relationship just didn't feel like how she thought it should feel for her. She said how I was still such a great person and she would love to be my friend at some point, I said I would have to see. She said she had started feeling this way those 6 days I hadn't seen her. This explains that gut feeling I had those 6 days. She said she didn't talk to any of her friends or family before she did this as she wanted to make a decision for herself. When I saw that there was no saving it, I then hugged her and explained how much she meant to me and thanked her for everything she has ever done for me. At this point she was crying in my arms and said how I was still so nice to her even in a time like this.

I kissed her forehead and we walked separate paths and that was it.

I haven't had any form of communication with her in almost 5 weeks. I haven't blocked her on social media, she still follows me and I do her. I only unfollowed a couple things so I dont see her face all the time. I posted on instagram a few times, her who usually will like my stuff hasn't liked anything. I am still sore from the situation and part of me wishes that I could have her back. I have made progress in these 5 weeks and have gone on a date (didn't work out) but it is very hard to get over her as our relationship was very good and there was no infidelity. It is a tough pill to swallow that she doesn't want to be with me. The deepest rejection I have ever received and It hurts so fucking much. Part of me wishes that she cheated on me so I could hate her, but the problem is there is no hate in my heart for her.

I have joined a dating app but it has been tough to score a date. I haven't had the same feeling of excitement for anyone since her.

I just dont know what to do. I dont know if she feels she made a mistake and wants me back. I don't know if I can meet someone who makes me feel the same way as I did with her. Part of me really really wants to contact her. I haven't done it but I dont know what to do. I just need advice for the whole situation as it is tearing me apart.

Any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I was thinking of reaching out to meet up in an attempt to get some closure. This break up was very out of the blue for me and it would be nice to put it to rest for good in my mind. Is that a good or bad idea?",2019-07-07 23:18:11,13,3,relationship_advice

I think I have a crush on a co-worker that I haven't known for long (original I knoooow). In general he behaves very nicely with me (but so do all my other coworkers) and seems to particularly appreciate spending time with me. That being said, he doesn't flirt with me at all, so his attitude with me could absolutely be considered friendly and nothing else. The only thing that gave me a doubt was that when we were having lunch the other day some crazy old man started complimenting me (calling me beautiful in an insane way) and he immediately jumped in and made him leave by saying ""I know, that's why I'm dating her"". 
So now my question is: ladies, has any of your male friends ever pretended to date you to save you of an embarrassing situation?

890,cadcxj,Ramoldruw,My [F 21] Boyfriend [M 28] Was Talking About Me Behind My Back,"I met my boyfriend online 7 years ago. We spent time in person last year and I am currently visiting again. I have been here for over a month and am leaving in a week.

We have had some issues, because I am not entirely happy with some of his behaviour. We have been talking about it, though. 

One of my issues is that he is extremely secretive to the point where he won't leave his phone on the table or sign into YouTube if I am present. We started talking about this and he got upset, handed me his phone unlocked, and told me to look through it and said ""please don't hate me"".

It turns out he has been talking badly about me behind my back with his best friend. He wrote things such as:

""This bitch needs so much attention, I'll be glad when she's gone"".

""I want her to just leave and stay left.""

And when asked if we had slept together, he wrote:

""I want to sleep with her but it's a 'don't stick your dick in crazy' kind of problem.""

In reference to his friend saying to not invite girls from other places:

""I agree. I won't be doing this stupid process again.""

Since I have read these, we discussed it and he seems upset and sorry and says he was just frustrated, but I am not buying it.  I think he is trying to seem sorry to my face and is probably shit-talking me still. I can't leave because changing the flight date so close would cost a lot of money.

895,cada8f,slothsrthebest6493,How to escape the breakup cycle after loss of trust/being cheated on (M26) (F25),"I started dating a girl when I was 22 and after the honeymoon phase things got pretty rough. We were constantly bickering and making fights out of the smallest things.

A little after our one year, my ex got hammered and eventually after a verbal argument I got beat up pretty bad, like blood, cuts, and bitten wounds.

Day after she acts like nothing happened and blames alcohol for it while apologizing profusely.

Eventually I forgive and our fights settled down until every now and then we would get verbal and she would get physical.

I had my suspicions I was being cheated on as well since there were things that i noticed changed. I found out that she was fucking other guys on vacation and casually sending nudes to other ppl while we were together. I would get sad and mope about why this happened to me and she got pissed at me for figuring out and flat out denies everything despite texts, and actual conversations.

She said she would stop this and it did for a bit and I knew I lost trust after I would have the urge to check her phone which I know means I don‚Äôt trust her. But I did and got hurt.

We eventually went through the cycle over and over again. Things got bad to the point of a restraining order bc i was scared for my own well being but I ended up spiraling down into deep sadness and decided to hit her up again to give it one more shot.

Now our initial time back together was great and felt like when we just began. But after a while, the same arguing and resentment towards each other got really bad but not physical as she cut down drinking.

Two months ago she said she needed to not hate herself and said she needed to end things with me. She said she was only in it for bettering herself and not being with other people and she wanted me to be the one, eventually but not now.

I just found out she fucked a guy and had another dude over just a few weeks ago while I was away.

I teared up as I said i thought that wasn‚Äôt your goal after our break up, and she said i was drunk and begged me to stay. I decided to not to do that and got slapped in the face twice before leaving.

I knew I lost trust in her after she cheated on me multiple times but I always get pulled in with I‚Äôll change and I‚Äôm afraid it will happen again. I tried putting my foot down by not escalating things and ending seeing each other in any capacity. She was my best friend and girlfriend, so it sucks but i just want to see what everyone thinks the best course of action.

I just keep thinking things will change but I‚Äôm starting to realize maybe I‚Äôm trying to pick up too many broken pieces.

897,cad9yk,Nicktator3,I feel like one of my best friendships is falling apart.,"I'm gonna try not to ramble with this but I tend to do that so bear with me. I'll leave a TLDR at the very bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been friends with this girl for nearly seven years now. I met her when we were freshmen in high school and we instantly clicked. We were great friends throughout that whole journey and I'll admit I developed stronger feelings for her that first year, although I never expected us to be anything more than friends (that's something I was ok with). She definitely became my best friend in high school, although I wouldn't say I was hers (not a problem for me); the only thing that mattered to me was that we were friends at all. She really was a great person to talk to, be around, and really made life better.

&amp;#x200B;

We started college three years ago and I was never really looking forward to it. As the end of our senior year of HS drew nearer I knew that by the end of the year I'd be seeing her less and less moving forward. It was a mild feeling at first, but I tried not to let it get to me...*that* much. But about a year-and-a-half or two years ago I started to feel that maybe she was forgetting about me and that we were kind of drifting apart. I dwelled on it a lot and it would really bring me down on the inside when I did. Nevertheless, I still had some optimism that we were still friends. Over the past year though I've continued to dwell on it and obviously it's continued to bring me down. Ever since we started college I've wanted to hang out with her to catch up (on like a seasonal break or something), since I haven't really seen her since we graduated high school. But every time I try to text her she doesn't seem that interested in talking or doesn't even respond. I completely understand that she could very well be busy. We're in college; people have a lot of work to do which includes internships. I get that. But at the same time I feel that she could still make a little time to at least get back to me (that's what I'd do). I've tried a couple times by now to reach out and say hi and to try and get a conversation going, but I've gotten the same results each time. I want to ask her if things between us are alright, but it's hard to do that when she won't even reply to me, and even if she did, I'm afraid of how to go about it. At this point I don't know if it would be right to say we're friends, and that really bothers me.

&amp;#x200B;

All I want is some closure but it seems like that's impossible to get. I don't know if things are really going downhill or if it's just my mind playing tricks on me. I feel like it could be both. I don't want to be pushy towards her and I'm trying my best not to, but I don't want to give up hope either; I'd never do that. In short it's frustrating. We've always been great friends but suddenly it's like we're not anymore. I don't know what to do and there's no one to talk to about it. I'm frustrated, sad, feel hopeless, and lost.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** I've been friends with this girl for nearly seven years now. We've always been great friends. I wouldn't say I'm her best friend but she's definitely been mine since we met. The past couple years though since we started college I've felt like we're becoming distanced.

898,cad8j1,random78016,Why I (31M) will never have a relationship,"I am a 31 year-old male with autism and depression. The autism mainly affects my social skills, I am quite normal in most other respects. The depression affects my emotions, it dulls them, and the anti-depressants I‚Äôm dosed up on dull them even more. I‚Äôve had depression half my life, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever going away and it is part of my personality now.

Even in a group of autistic people I am the odd one out, sitting in the corner unable to socialise. I make an OK friend and have a few; I can have conversations about specific topics, share common interests, I listen, I am reliable and don‚Äôt gossip. However, I don‚Äôt have any close friends because I don‚Äôt know how to socialise, that is just be in someone else‚Äôs company and talk and have fun, and have them enjoy my company in return. I can watch other people socialise and have no idea what they are talking about or how they do it.

This is an even bigger problem when it comes to relationships. I can talk to girls just fine if it‚Äôs about specific things and ask them questions about themselves. But ultimately to have a relationship with someone you need an emotional connection with them. You need to be able to make them smile, laugh and feel good about themselves. What chance do I have of ever doing these things when I don‚Äôt experience these emotions myself?",2019-07-07 23:00:23,4,2,relationship_advice

I love my girlfriend, she‚Äôs the sweetest person on earth. But I‚Äôve been finding myself thinking about other women a lot.

Some background -
I‚Äôve been in long relationships pretty much my whole adult life. A couple of years ago I got out of a long relationship. I was single for a year and it was between depressing and awesome. Had some memorable moment and people.

I felt ready to get in a relationship when we met.
We had a good spark but I wasn‚Äôt attracted to her enough physically. I decided to try it out and see how I like it.
We really hit it off personality-wise and I was enjoying it, but in the back of my mind I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúthis is not going the last person I‚Äôm going to sleep with‚Äù. Just because of my issues with her looks. And she was complimenting my appearance all the time. Felt bad for that.

Eventually we grew closer and I had to decide whether I‚Äôm ready to really get in to this. I told her I wanted to take it slow at first.
I concluded she was something too good in my life to give up for a somewhat shallow reason.

We had a great time together since, but once in a while I would still have these lingering thoughts. I didn‚Äôt know what to do with them. Felt like I couldn‚Äôt share that with anybody, especially not her.

We are sexually active. But I‚Äôm in a role I‚Äôm not used to from the past, where I am the one that isn‚Äôt the mood as much as the other.

Lately I find myself uncomfortable around attractive women that I feel a click with just because I start feeling bad about the thoughts they trigger.

I love that woman, don‚Äôt want to hurt her. I didn‚Äôt prioritize great looks in my choice of women over the years and I felt like that was a great feat since I had some great relationships.
Suddenly I feel like I need.. more? and I feel like a jackass for it because that‚Äôs not really who I thought I was or who I wanted to be.

Iv‚Äôe been considering taking private counseling about this from a professional. Also considering trying to keep my head above water and maintain the current situation since it‚Äôs still fulfilling to a still pretty extent (except whatever‚Äôs making write in this sub).

&amp;#x200B;

I met her in school when i was 16, we kinda had a redraft of classes and i didnt know about her, as she just switched to this school. We didnt really talk much in the beginning to be completly frank, only when we had to split a lecture book, but when we did... it was really pleasant and getting to know her was a fresh breeze in an idiotic and full of chaos school life cuz u know... puberty likes to kick u in the balls every now and then. Time passed and me and some friends really got to know her as a person. After spending some more time with her i found out she found my best mate (also a part of that friends group at school) cute and my best mate was really lovin the idea of havin a gf as he never had one before.

SO NOW WE GET TO THE , how i call it, **Arc of the wannabe puppetmaster**

**C¬¥mon** u know where this is heading... I tried to get em together but oh boi, i did it in the most stupid way possible:

I tried to get em to meet up more in summer holidays -&gt; both had plans. Well and i realised another thing:

We (me and her) were way too close. She would vent every now and then, and i would vent to her. A lot of things happened that uh in retrospect... were pretty clear invitation for advances on my side, but i didnt realise shit, whatever i had in my heart, in my brain, in my veins. SO WHAT DID UR OP BOI DO? *check the next epis-*  okay okay i am sorry, defense mechanism (hi to my friend Chandler Bing). I will try to keep the rest short:

1. I realised she was fully interegated in that friends group of mine (which included ma best mate) and isolated myself and kept myself off the group, found new mates and had my fun with em.
2. Talked to them both and told em they really like each other, even though both really thought of the opposite.
3. Gave infos to some friends that helped me out every now and then by settin a good mood up for em without me bein involved

Finally it worked out for them, but just to make sure i still avoided that friend group and watched the relationship from the side same as u would watch a seed grow. Every now and then she messaged me and i messaged her. But her messages were barely smalltalk. Most of the time she was like ""hey, u sure he likes me?"" It was his first gf, so obviously he didnt know what he was doin most of the time. So i reassured her and told my mate in secret about it, everytime it was needed. But even then when i wasnt sure of my feelings, it did hurt when she only messaged me when it was about him.

So at some point i got pissed and just started ""hatin"" her and talked shit about her with other people, as she wasnt really the most popular person the first place. She started to get a hold of it, started messaging me less and started to be mad at me. (Me as ""vent guy"" got replaced by another good friend of mine and well he sometimes asked me for advice so i guess i still had my fingers in play overthere)

&amp;#x200B;

Time passed and we all graduated. I was still outside of the group and well we all split up and are workin on our careers now. At the start (when we both were 18) i still kept in touch with my best mate. And some months after graduation he told me how he broke up with her a day ago. My immediate reflex obviously was to feel bad for him and to just talk things out with him, as i did the same at the time (kinda off topic but i was still dating other girls during that period and well, just came out of a pretty toxic relationship, so i kinda knew how he felt). He and her were seemingly at a break cuz of some stuff and well after some time they broke it off completely, not because they didnt have any feelings left, but because of different stuff.

Sadly enough me and my mate just went our ways and dont have much time to meet up and all.

Now, how is she doin? Well lots of people told me about her every now and then. Seemingly she got really upset after that break up and felt lost. She fell in love with someone -&gt; broke up with the person after some weeks. Every single time.

At some point she went full wh\*re mode and downloaded Tinder, u know what came next.

Anyways lets just jump to now. I am still studying and she is doin the same. She has a bf right now.

And some days ago, i had a talk with my homies and realised how much in love i was. And how much in love i am right now. I dont know why, but my feelings never stopped. Even though i dated other persons. Even though i promised all of em that i love only them and want to stay with em till the day i die. All these feelings i was just keeping inside came free and now i am blinded. I swear to god i dont know what to do.

We are on bad terms. We are both busy. **Geez she got a bf.** 

So what did i do? YUH HUH i messaged her and we had some smalltalk. Every. message. made me happy like a 7 year old who gets whatever he wants for his birthday.

I dont know... Maybe it is just because i am stressed out lately, that i am searchin for something good from the past, that really made me happy...

TLDR: I were close to a girl. But instead of realising that it was love, i brought my best friend and her together, but isolated myself from the group in the process. Now to the situation in hand: We all graduated and are on our career paths. They broke up and after lots of dating she found a new bf. Lost contact to both of em and focused myself on studies. After a long talk with friends i realised it was love back then, and i still feel like that. I messaged her and just had some wholesome smalltalk. I am stupid and cant do TLDRs.

This is my first post EVER so i am sorry for grammar mistakes and things like that.

I dont know exactly why i am posting this but i just wanna know what other people think about this situation and whatever they would do. I know i rambled a lot. Sorry.",2019-07-07 22:52:12,1,1,relationship_advice
904,cad59a,angroe6,My [28F] depression is ruining my relationship,"My boyfriend\[24M\] and I have been dating for just under a year now. He's the best partner I've ever had. He's smart, loving, funny and attractive. He has all the qualities I've wanted in a partner and some I didn't know I wanted until being with him. I can communicate most of my feelings with him, something I could never do before. We can be our complete selves and always have a blast together.

We met last year when we interned for the same company. We instantly hit it off and started dating before the internship ended. We went back to our hometowns which are on opposite sides of the US. Long distance was very hard. We broke up for a month because of his jealousy and neediness issues. We got back together after meeting up at a conference. We decided to give it a try after an amazing weekend together.

Things were great for several months. He worked very hard on this issues and sought counseling for them. He made huge improvements with a few hiccups every once in a while. We'd have weekly Face Time dates and would talk on the phone every evening. Long distance allowed us to love each other while maintaining independence and freedom to hang out with friends and focus on our studies. This is something I had struggled with in my previous relationship where my partner was very codependent.

He came to visit me for a week over winter break. We had a really good time except for the fact that my libido had dropped significantly. I could barely have sex while he was here. It was really hard for the both of us. I had been looking forward to being intimate with him but just couldn't. Its a problem I've had in all of my relationships. We have sex like bunnies in the beginning but then it dies down to almost nothing after a few months. I love him so much, this is the only problem that we have.

Another thing to note is that I have Bipolar Depression. I've had it for two years now. I've gone through many medications in the time we've been together and each one has fucked me up in one way or another. I'm on just one now that I've been taking since I was i diagnosed. It works great, sort of. I'm also in therapy and have talked to my therapist about my low libido but nothing has helped.

We're in the same town for the summer, since late May, working in our respective fields. I was accepted into a program and am living with 30 people in one house. It's not that bad! He's not in the program and isn't allowed to spend the night here. We've spent all of our time together and have gotten along really well. The sex issue still remains. He has a high libido and would have sex every day if we could. He's getting frustrated with me about not being able to have sex. We still do about 3 times a week but he initiates every time. He wants me to take the lead.

Hes been gone on a expedition, completely off the grid, for over a week now and I'm losing it. Since he's the only person I've hung out with since I've been here, I feel really lonely in a full house. I get along with everyone but have a hard time socializing with them. It doesn't help that I bought a weed pen and have been smoking every day since I've got it. I know that's normal for some people but it really fucks with my mental health. I've become really depressed. I cry for most of the day. Not just because he's gone but because I have realized that I actually hate the major I've chosen. In this internship I've realized that I do not actually enjoy it. It just gives a lot of anxiety and frustration. I'm over $20k in debt because of it and have come to realize that I'd like to go to graduate school in a completely different field. I also had to take my meds every other day so I wouldn't run out while I was here. I'm on a pretty heavy dose so that definitely added to my depression.

He called me a few days ago to see how I was doing. I was on the verge of tears the whole time but tried to hide it. He called me two days later to ask what was wrong. He told me that the phone call ruined the last two days for him. It completely broke my heart. I don't want him to spend the rest of the time there worrying about me.

I've come to the conclusion that I'm no good for him. I can't give him the love and care that he deserves. I can't tell if I'm feeling this way because of the depression or if breaking up is something we seriously need to consider. His only other relationship was with someone who also had Bipolar Disorder so he's really familiar with it. Although, his ex was really abusive mentally and physically. I've been mildly depressed on and off since we've been together and he has been very supportive. He doesn't get back for another week and half. So I'm kind of lost in my thoughts right now.

906,cad3u0,forestman507,Please help me make sense of this situation - my girlfriend[F23] cheated on me[M22] with her ex in the beginning of our relationship,"Me \[22\] and my girlfriend \[23\] met on a work exchange in USA, and we were both staying in employee housing. We started dating, and although there wasn't much chemistry, I liked her and we spent a lot of time together. She started sleeping in my room every night, and since we were both virgins I took things really slowly, so she could be very comfortable.

About 20 days in our relationship, one night we were watching a movie and she got a call and panickly left saying it's her friend. She came back about 10-15 mins later visibly shaken and hugged me. I ask her what's wrong and she admits that she went to see her ex (whit whom she was just before she met me) and that he tried to ""kiss her and do more than that"" but she said she wants to be with me, lose her virginity with me and cannot lose me. I was shocked but we dealt with it quickly and moved on. After that she stopped contact with him.

Fast forward 6 months later and I found out bit by bit the whole story. She did some sexual things with him while they were in a relationship (she would help him out but never let him have sex with her - virginity was very important to her, religious background and she felt she didn't want to lose it with him) and she had feelings for him. She found out he had a girlfriend, and he left her. After that, she meets me but doesn't feel much of a connection (like I didn't) and when he contacts her again she happily sees him. She went to his room few times while we were together. They would kiss, and she gave him a blowjob and then she would come see me and sleep in my bed. That night that I caught her what actually happened is he took of her panties and almost had sex with her, at which point she ran away to me. She was terrified I would leave her if I knew this and she kept it hidden all this time. All this information I gathered with a lot of trickle-truthing over the months.

Point is, after that night, we started an amazing relationship, lost our virginity together, traveled together, I even visited her 2 times in her country, and we split the ticket costs. We truly fell in love, but it feels like it was all based on a lie. I don't know how to feel about this and I'm very confused. On one hand I feel betrayed, on the other I feel like I understand her - our connection wasn't obvious and it took some time to flourish. And I've heard about women sometimes staying one foot in an old relationship before moving on to the next one. Should I throw it away for something in the past? I feel like I would make a big mistake, but I've also seen how much she can lie and i don't know if i can ever think of her the same way..",2019-07-07 22:47:59,17,2,relationship_advice
907,cad3q9,VmlwZXIzMTIw,Disappointed; Good friend begging my gf for nudes,"So today I found out that one of my good friends is one of the biggest **** I've ever known.

A little background information: 
I've been together with my gf in a LDR for some years now. I love her and she is very loyal to me. She always tells me stuff, won't do anything stupid, just as things should be, I guess.
I have a friend for about 4 years now, we're both developers. If you're a developer, too, you know this special friendship. We've been working on projects together since years now and always helped each others out, regarding coding stuff. My gf, him and some other friends are also playing league of legends every day. So, we're a group of good friends, which makes this even more sad.

Last holidays, when my gf came to me, she used my laptop. When I used it at work again, I noticed, that she did not log out of discord. I wanted to log out, but I noticed some discord notifications popping up in the Windows 10 notification center, which interrupted me. I opened it, cleared all notifications and just in that moment, when they've been all wiping away, my eye catched one notification containing my friends discord user name and a Euro symbol. It made me curious.

Despite feeling bad for it, cause you just should not look at other people's private chat, I had to open that chat. I just flew over like the 5 most recent messages and I instantly knew what it was all about. My friend was not just asking, but begging my gf for nudes. He said that he would pay high amounts for her.

I contacted my gf and asked her what it's all about. She was okay with me reading the messages and said that she did not tell me cause she did not want to break the friendship between my friend and me. I asked her if I could read the full thing and she was like ""yea go for it"".

I found out that this has been going on since about a year. My gf was constantly denying him (which makes me very happy) but he was begging her every God damn week, for over a year! He offered her high amounts of money (I know that he has a lot of money, so yeah, I think he would actually pay her that much) and every time he got the information that her and I want to buy something pricier, or for example a new pricy skin in league of legends came out, he immediately texted her ""I can buy you that, just make me some nudes, okay? You don't have to show your face and I can immediately delete it after watching"" and bs like this. What really got me and what makes me really sad atm is that he always said ""He will never find out, trust me"". We've been friends for years now! We've coded on our projects together almost every day. How can you be such an ****!? How can he even talk to me like normal...

I am just about to remove his access to my gitlab repositories and block him everywhere.. I do not want to talk to this dude anymore.. I can only imagine, if I would confront him with this, he would be like ""Ohh you finally found out! Haha, did your gf tell you or did you find out somehow else? Well, actually, now I can tell you, I was just testing your girlfriend, if she is loyal to you."" or something like that. But I'll sleep over it for one night.

How would you guys handle this situation? I'm a bit shocked right now and I don't want to overreact. 

TL;DR: Friend of mine and me are developer buddies since years. Found out he is begging my gf for nudes since over a year.",2019-07-07 22:47:39,13,2,relationship_advice

909,cad3ne,throwwwawwway5280,Asking my wife to keep a job she hates.,"Long time lurker, first-time poster. Throw away account since my actual account is known. Put a short version at the bottom. Sorry for the long post, any advice is appreciated. 

My wife(F21) and I(M24) have been married since February, we dated for 2 years before that. Everything has been great and fantastic, I know she is the one for me. When we met we were both shifts leads at a fast food chain making $13-15 an hour. This was fine we were both in school, we each brought in about 18K a year and saved money by living at my parent's house. However even combined this is not really a great household income when we would eventually be paying rent or looking to get a home of our own. 
I graduated in spring and took a job that started in the summer. It pays 45K a year, great company, and has health benefits. It's a good career path for me and I should be making 70-80K by next summer when I pass a certification. 
This job is making us move to a new state where the cost of living is much lower. As such we could pay a mortgage on a house or pay rent for about the same cost(we have 3 large dogs, we need a yard). We decided to look into houses and have made an offer on a property that lets me get to work and lets her attend a state college(she has an associate and is working towards bachelors, and has been accepted already). 
After all our bills, insurance, car payments, food and mortgage my paycheck is completely used up. The income from my job would allow us to get by but we wouldn't be putting away for a rainy day or saving anything. 
Currently, she makes 15.25 an hour and works part-time. When we move she can transfer and keep this pay rate and her hours. Which would bring in about 1400 a month? 
The other day she was looking at local jobs and leaving her current job for one. The thing is minimum wage here is around 9 dollars and none of these jobs she was looking at will pay her more than 11 an hour. 
I brought up how my entire salary covers our basic needs, but after paying for everything with that there isn't really money left over for savings or anything extra like concerts or date nights. 
She works around 24 hours a week while in school. If she takes a pay cut and goes for a new job then 1400 turns to 1000 pretty quickly. 
I love my wife and want her to be happy. But she seems to be viewing her job as a hobby/time filler and isn't seeing that the money could be used in ways to better our future. End of the day the money from my job is our money and should be used to provide for us and I love that we can afford to get a house and start working on our short term goals. But if that's the case the extra income she generates should be valued and used to help our goals as well. This idea of her taking a rather large pay cut bothers me. We agreed that my income should be used on the expenses I mentioned earlier. But she doesn't seem to think that her income needs to be what it is and that we can afford for her to take a pay cut. 
When I brought this up she felt like she was stuck in her job and hates going in. I totally got that and told her that I want her to be happy at her job, but the pay cut would hurt our finances a lot.  I said if it was helping with a future career I didn't have an issue and we can take a cut from saving, but if this is a fun job for a few months then she should be considering taking on more hours or finding a better pay rate so we can be saving that money. She asked that we no longer discuss the topic for the night. Which has given me some time to think. 
I feel like a jerk telling her she needs to stay at a job she doesn't love, but it's not forever. It's for about a year while I work on getting my certification. Then she would be able to either work less or get a job somewhere she is passionate or volunteers to help her apply for a job post-graduation. She is on track to graduate in 2 years. 
How can I bring this up in a way that isn't hurtful or bossy? I want to start securing our future and she has goals in the next 3-5 years where saving a few extra grand could really help us. Any ideas would be really appreciated. 

Short version: My new job pays for everything, but doesn't put money away for savings. My wife wants to take a 1/3rd pay cut for any newb and doesn't understand why this upsets me and won't discuss it.",2019-07-07 22:47:28,4,1,relationship_advice
910,cad2q5,unsure123456777,"Struggling to come to terms with how different my partner (M, 27) and I (F, 27) are.","Throwaway, but if he reads it, he reads it.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been with my boyfriend for nearly 2 years. Our relationship moved very fast and I wasn't expecting it - we had started dating and I moved in with him (and then flatmates) within 4 months. This relationship offered alot of what I wasn't getting in the previous relationship, including personal growth. But a change has sparked me feeling that this relationship might not be worth continuing because of how different we are. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am very driven to do well in my career and academically. I'm in a managerial position which asks for alot of overtime, and is emotionally draining and because of this, my stress levels are sky high but I'm not one to back down from hard work.  I've landed myself in a shit situation where I find it hard to switch off, and am trying to integrate some sort of hobbies back into my life. I tend to be self-sacrificing, especially in a relationship and unable to properly express how I feel (been called a robot on more an one occasion) and until previously, very unaware I was like this. My bf, unlike my previous one, offers me unconditional love and physical affection which I found very hard to reciprocate initially. As this was an issue for him, we discussed this, and I integrated it into therapy sessions I was already having. This has been a trigger for me untangling alot about myself - I am trying to not lock away my emotions, trying to understand and accept them, trying to feel less guilty about having needs met and opinions heard. This teething process isn't easy for both of us. It means I can come across as overly emotional, then flip a switch, ask to go out/spend time together then retract all together etc. It is something I've acknowledged and have been speaking to my psychologist about for 6+ months which tbh is only the start.

&amp;#x200B;

He's quite different from me. He's been in a manual job since he left school, and due to some learning difficulties as a child, never felt comfortable pursuing any further study. He spends a significant amount of time gaming, hardly goes outside the apartment and finds it hard to integrate socially. There's some days where he can spend 14 hrs in front of his screens and barely get up. He's less motivated and driven when it comes to career, or anything else really. I initially didn't think much of this, but the more that we've lived together I don't understand how he spends so much time in one chair without doing anything. It bothers me that he's rarely active. He's brought up before that he's aware it's a form of distraction and escapism for him. I've brought it up several times that it bothers me, but he's very defensive about it, and doesn't really acknowledge them as issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have been looking at property to buy. Not because we're starting a family or anything - but because he's got the money, and wants to invest it and see a good return. He constantly talks about investments etc but hasn't known what to do because he just doesn't know finance. I've been doing the research and reading for us, because it's something I'm naturally inclined to.  He was having trouble with this, so I searched for a professional and booked an appointment for him because it typically helps him digest information better (and we had conflicting opinions about what to do, and this way offered a 3rd party objective view). He's also been wanting to change jobs for over a year, but will start, get frustrated by his lack of options, or struggle to write his resume, give up, ask me for help - I feel like he's significantly relying on me to help out with this as well.

&amp;#x200B;

This has brought up the current negatives and potential long term negatives in the relationship. On one hand, it's showing me that he's willing to let me do the hard work and adult stuff whilst he has loads of free time. If I point this out, he points out that he can't read large volumes of text and his brain doesn't make sense of it - fair enough. So I point out that I also had to book an appointment so he could have another form of information (verbally, by a professional) etc and I can't help but feel like if we go into this long term, I am putting myself in a position where I am assuming the responsibility of being the adult in the relationship. This isn't exclusive to this situation either - I do the cooking, because he finds it hard to learn that, I always think of ideas for date night, because that's also a struggle for him etc. On the other hand, I am grateful that he appears to shower me with affection and is willing to put up with me during this emotional shit storm I'm in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I should be able to put up with the way he is because he's putting up and more with the way I am now. The one thing I keep thinking is that I am actively trying to improve myself, whereas he is still not acknowledging some issues he has let alone wanting to improve. We have had a growing number of disagreements over the last few weeks and I'm struggling to see things objectively. I don't want to be with someone long term who isn't ambitious or independent, or who would rather spend most waking hours in front of screens vs trying to have an even split of spending time with me, actually seeing the world and then having some quality screen time. I love him, but I don't want to be an enabler of his behaviour.",2019-07-07 22:44:57,10,1,relationship_advice

That night we shared a bed, with others in the room (after a big night) and he wouldn't let me get out of bed, instead he pulled me closer. We made out and when we stopped he was kissing my forehead repeatedly and cuddling me, I asked him what it meant to which he replied that he cared about me and wanted to know if I was OK.

But when he's sober he'll act like nothing happened, and it's driving me crazy because I've started to really like him due to all these things and how sweet he is.

When he broke up with me, his reason was that he didn‚Äôt love me anymore. 

Well it took me some time to get over E, especially due to the fact that we had broken up a few times and always got back together so I had hope. At the time of the breakup, I was very in love with him, and though he had broken up with me before I still took it hard. 

However, E and I met through mutual friends who had turned into a friend group while we dated. There‚Äôs a lot of people in that group and it‚Äôs tight knit, which was good when we dated because we had a lot of mutual friends to hang out with. This ended up being bad after we broke up though because I still had to see him very frequently. Though we always kept light contact, we eventually started to become close again resulting in us being very close friends, with no romantic attraction surprisingly. This was about 6 months after we broke up.

To this day, we are very close friends and there are really no sexual or romantic vibes. We‚Äôve even slept in the same bed since then and nothing has happened. I am over him. At the beginning of our friendship, I suggested even doing a FWB thing but he said No. E and I had many conversations during our friendship where he said he had no more feelings for me. So I believed that he didn‚Äôt like me anymore which I eventually got over. Our relationship is now VERY platonic and I‚Äôm okay with that, he even had a (now ex) girlfriend since then and I was genuinely not jealous or hurt at all, even when meeting her. 

Since then, our friend group has gotten bigger - friends bringing other friends, etc - including a new guy named N. Me and him actually didn‚Äôt talk right away but after meeting, we clicked and after about 2 months of being friends we started dating. E knows N from being in the same friend group but is not close to him, we met N at the same time.

Now that N and I are dating, we attend our friend group events as a couple. Though we are not overly affectionate, we are in a normal couple way - some hand holding, kissing, flirting etc. This has been going on for about 2 months. Recently, E has privately expressed to me that it makes him uncomfortable when I am publicly affectionate with N. This came as a shock to me due to the fact that 1) E has brought his (ex) gf to group things and 2) E and I had no romantic feelings towards each other anymore. We got into a fight after E said that and we haven‚Äôt talked since then. 

What should I do? Is E in the right? 

TLDR; My ex bf and I are very close platonic friends. He has recently said that he feels uncomfortable when I am publicly affectionate with my new boyfriend.",2019-07-07 22:37:33,9,2,relationship_advice
916,caczru,KiraiHotaru,How can I switch a relationship from flirty to friendly ?,"Ok so this guy that I used to go to school with recently started following me on Instagram, and then texted me. I always thought he didn't like me (for absolutely no reason ?) so this came to me as a surprise, I responded and we've been actively texting ever since. 
It's now been a month since we started texting and our conversation is mainly playful but also a little bit flirty at times.
I know from the way he talks that he's obviously interested in me, but I on the other hand, quickly realized I wasn't romantically interested in him. I'd love to have him as a friend though, especially since I don't have a lot of friend and I'm currently trying to make some. 
For this holiday he came back to my city to see his parents and friends (he usually lives in Paris for university while I'm still in the north of France), so he asked to see me... And tonight we did ! 
I'm actually very proud of myself eheh because that's a huge accomplishment for me, I have one of the worst case of social anxiety I've ever seen in someone and never ever ever do this kind of thing ! But tonight I challenged myself and forced myself to go meet him, I got a friend (that he knew) to come along with me and we talked to him for a few minutes. 
My friend told me afterwards that she could see in the way he looked at me that he liked me however that's not the type of relationship I want with him. 
Now I'm trying to figure out how to shift our relationship to something more platonic before it gets too serious, right now he hasn't made a direct ""romantic move"" (like formally asking me on a date etc...). 
Since the nature of our relationship is still ambiguous I feel like I can choose which way it's going to go, but how can I do that ?",2019-07-07 22:37:20,7,1,relationship_advice
917,cacz89,Throwaway51394,I(25M) made a series of choices that led to the break up with my GF(24F). Did I fuck up or was this the right move? I am feeling regretful and missing her,"Hi everyone. I am looking for any guidance or words of wisdom about the situation with my now ex-gf that led to our breakup. If you want more info, you can look through many of my past posts in this sub or other relationship subs.

In short, the relationship was very toxic in many ways but also very fun and exciting when it was good, like a rollercoaster. Feel free to look at past posts to see the drama that went on, but in short she did not always treat me with respect, she would insult me when she was angry, would flirt with other guys over social media or in person, would try to control me and get overly jealous, threaten to fuck other guys, blocking me when slightly angry, silent treatment, etc. This is not to say I was perfect at all, as I could get jealous and angry, but usually in response to her hurtful words or flirting or threatening to download tinder or threatening to fuck other guys. Whereas her jealous was not really founded on anything I was doing, more so she felt insecure.

Back in the end of March, she and I had a roadtrip planned to go to CO. But the two weeks before, she had broken up with me and blocked me because I didn't want to share a certain facebook post that was talking about one of my female professors (I was in graduate school at the time) who had some allegations of saying sexist things. This professor had already been fired and her husband was my advisor and so I didn't want to burn any bridges. So she had ""broken up"", like many times before, but this time was much longer, lasting two weeks.

So after the two weeks, she tried to get back together to go on our roadtrip but I cancelled the trip. I tried to end the relationship right then, but she threatened to kill herself and I caved to that manipulation and didn't break up. During April, I started distancing myself with the excuse of working on my schoolwork and my thesis (this was also true but also an excuse). I saw her maybe once during April. This caused her to be so upset and caused a lot of fighting between us. She started drinking everyday, but by the end of April I had helped her to stop drinking. Then I graduated with my Masters, and during May and June I continued distancing myself by using focusing on my career as an excuse. I saw her once in May and once in June. I was trying to gear up to break up but I also couldn't for some reason, as I deeply love and care for her and also I have been addicted to our very strong sexual connection, but my logical mind was telling me the drama would only get worse and I needed to get out. But my heart didn't want to. All of this reusing to see her made her so upset and caused many fights. I felt so terrible for upsetting her and causing her to drink so much during April. I was(am) so depressed about it.

Fast forward to this past weekend. We had bought tickets months ago to go to a festival but I had sold my ticket during April. She spent the next two months trying to convince me to buy another ticket and go with her but I always refused, because I thought we would be broken up by then. But I never was able to.

Right before the festival, we got into an argument about something small but I started trying to talk about breaking up again and she got mad and said to me ""I am glad your dad died last year, you deserved it"". I was so mad that I told her I wanted to be over. But right before she turned her phone off for the festival, I messaged her that I wish would make this work and I don't want to have to breakup.

After the festival happened, a mutual friend told me that she had cheated on me during the festival by making out and dancing with a guy. She apparently tried to have sex with him but he refused because he also has a GF. I was so upset that I, of course, dumped her and blocked her. But now, three days later I feel so regretful of the last few months. During that time, I felt it was right to distance myself from the relationship even thought my heart still wanted her. But now, I am just wishing I never refused to hang out with her all that time and I wish I never sold my ticket. My heart wants her so badly. If i had not distanced my self and if I had gone to the festival, none of this would have happened and we would still be together. She told me she tried to have sex with that guy because ""we weren't good and I didn't know if we would stay together.""

So that basically means it is all my fault and I could have avoided this. I am just going completely crazy about this and I am looking for any input. Was this all my fault? Did I make the right choice in distancing myself and trying to get closer to breaking up? I feel that I was trying to break up but it was too painful in my heart and I couldn't, so I tried to distance myself to make it easier, but now it has led to extreme pain in knowing she had sex with this guy. Did I do the right thing? Or did I fuck up? I am just wishing I didn't refuse to see her all those times because we could have had so much fun together and we would still be together now. Any input is appreciated, thanks.

TL;DR: been with my girlfriend for two years, and she has been very mean and abusive but also the relationship has been very fun an exciting. I have been distancing myself for the last three months trying to get closer to ending it, but now that it‚Äôs over I feel nothing but regret and am wondering if I‚Äôve done the right thing, because my heart just wants her so badly.",2019-07-07 22:35:57,3,2,relationship_advice

 I am seeking advice about how to think before speaking to my wife. My wife is always dropping hints about what she wants and I‚Äôm really bad at remembering what she said. Let‚Äôs say the other day while we were eating out we discussed where we were going to go afterwards. We came to agreement that we would dedicate a whole day to go to a place nearby. Well after the meal, as we are driving towards that area I say, hey, want to go check that place out, like it was a new idea. She then gets rightfully pissed that I‚Äôm not paying any attention and that I could not think of the reason why she is angry. I try to apologize and it only makes her angrier. 
Another situation, today where after we had made up a little bit, she was a bit upset that I hadn‚Äôt bought a heater for the house yet and I told her I would pick one up from target after I took her home. She then gets upset that I think I can afford to buy one and that she has been sending me links on Facebook market to buy a used one. This was just after a conversation we had where I told her I will think before I speak. I realize that I do think before I speak, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm thinking the right thoughts. We‚Äôve been married over five years but I am only 25 so I think I‚Äôm really immature when it comes to paying close attention to my wife. We are pretty closed to getting divorced and I really don‚Äôt want to and I really want to change this bad habit of mine and really pay attention to my wife.

919,cacwm7,justsara7991,Grandma is seeming very irrational lately,"My grandma is in her late 70s, and seems to be getting irrationally angry at my mother lately, wondering if it could be a sign of mental illness, or any advice on the situation. 

My parents, me and my siblings, and all of SOs went on vacation to see my dads side of the family. My mom posted a photo of us with the extended family and posted it on Facebook. After that, my grandma on my moms side has been ignoring her. My mom proceeded to ask if she was receiving her messages, to which my grandma replied ""yes but I've chosen not to answer because I am so hurt and disrespected and I dont feel as though I have any family in [city we are from] and I will not talk about this because I need to save my energy for the bathroom repairs I'm getting done"".

 My mom was confused about what she could have done considering she reached out to my grandma 4 seperate times through this trip. So she called her sister to see if she had talked to her. 

Apparently, my grandma is mad because the extended family met my sisters boyfriend before she did (they have only dated 6 months), and that my boyfriend doesn't play guitar for her?? Furthermore upset that my mom doesnt force my sister and I to visit her (we are both adults and have gone to visit her in the past month). As well as said that my mom has not seen her in 6 months. My mom visited her the day before they left, the vacation only lasted a week. She then told my aunt that my mom needs to parent us and ""make us visit her"".

Keep in mind, my mom is a very selfless person, she helps her mom tremendously, helps her with everything she needs, they go on weekend group outings together, we invite her to every holiday/birthday, and my mom calls her regularly. All of this stemming from a picture posted with extended family. 

Wondering if this seems a bit delusional, it seems like a lot to blatantly ignore your daughter because your granddaughter hasnt introduced her new boyfriend to her? 

If any of you have experienced similar, any advice on what my mom should do would be great.",2019-07-07 22:29:15,2,1,relationship_advice

I understand that with me being so young, older people may look at this as ‚ÄúBeing a kid‚Äù so to speak. The issue is that I‚Äôve always been like this.

  I also understand that having the prerequisites mindset of ‚ÄúKnowing how it‚Äôll end‚Äù may indeed fuel the expected failure but I don‚Äôt believe in, love at first sight. That‚Äôs Hollywood bullshit made for selling tickets. People don‚Äôt just love each other from looking into each other eyes. It‚Äôs how they interact with each other and how they carry themselves. People often disappoint me and that‚Äôs why I gravitate towards the internet because I never have to meet anyone and can do and say what I like. 
  I feel that way because I have so much experience with all sorts of relationships that I can categorize where it‚Äôll go and guess how long it‚Äôll work. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where when the inevitable break up comes. I just act like I‚Äôm hurt.  I cry, argue, talk, Ect until they have a hissy fit over it ending.

924,cacv22,dewycanon,Boyfriends mother is jealous of me and ACCUSED me of lying to her multiple times?,"I'm not sure how to start this, as it'll be a long wall of text but I need some advice..

Let's call my boyfriend (M) and his mother (C). I am (J)

Me and my boyfriend (M) met in January of this year and had our first date February 14th. After that things really kicked off. I had a dating history of falling in love and crying seeing the relationship wouldn't work, and some short flames, being cheated on and such. Basically I was tired of crying and stressing over boys and men and *FINALLY* found a boy who was all around mature and considering me and my well being. I always had this fantasy of dating my highschool sweetheart and I like this relationship a lot.

Fast forward to February 26th, I ask him why I can't meet his mom (jokingly) and goes on to tell me his mom actually was very rude and passive aggressive towards him when she found out about his last relationship. Wouldnt talk to him for a week he said. This made me a little hesitant but It was whatever. 

Fast forward again he tells me he can meet me in his state and it wouldn't matter if his mom knew because

1. I'm not going to his house

2. She doesn't own the state

So I meet up with (M) in hopes my bus doesn't fuck up as it's planned to pick me up by 5:15. WELL you can imagine how that goes because the bus gets canceled and I'm stuck in that state. Forced to stay over (M)s house, (C) catches us, horrible first impression. Yadda yadda yadda. (C) tells me and (M) and that she doesn't want him to have a girlfriend right now. Well that morning he tells her he's not breaking up with me. She's pissed, but whatever.

Throughout that whole week after the night we get caught she's surprisingly nice to him and tells him she apologizes for saying all that rude, nasty stuff to me and whatnot. A little while later she invites me over. 

After all that happened I regularly spend the night on the weekends, we all go on trips together and she's just a polite person but here some things that happen inbetween and have led up to now:

‚Ä¢ (M) is not allowed to see me in free time, (M) is forced to stay at home doing nothing

‚Ä¢ (C) says we see each other too much now and now can only see each other every 2 weeks.

‚Ä¢ No (M) isn't allowed to come over my house, ever apparently and NEEDS to watch over us. My mother loves (M) and (C) has *ignored* my mothers texts asking if he can come over FOR ONCE.

‚Ä¢ (C) Has sent his godmother to basically spy on him make sure he's not with anyone AKA me

‚Ä¢ We can't hug, kiss, hold hands in front of (C)

‚Ä¢ doesn't approve of anything I eat apparently I need to eat what she eats, I need to follow her life style and is ALWAYS suggest I do something differently. I can't wear certain things either. Doesn't like my hair out which I love it out. 

I can't shake the feeling she doesn't like me. Recently though she ACCUSED me of lying to her and saying I didn't shower and was actually running sink water. If it was sink water you would've known, WOULD'VE SOUNDED DIFFERENT. I'm 18 right now, have a job and my boyfriend is turning 18 in 6 months. Apparently I lied to her and he couldn't see me this weekend. That apparently I CONSTANTLY lie to her. I barely talk to her. EVER... so now I'm on the verge of texting her and setting shit straight. But I know nothing good will come out of this. But I'm so angry, every chance he gets. The amount of free time he has he can't spend with me. It's always NO ?

Our camp was a dozen people, some I knew very well, some I met before and some I only met there. One of the people I met there was this girl, friend of a sister of a friend, you know how it goes. We talked a lot, flirted kinda (i think?), and at one or two concerts she cuddled up to me to sleep on my shoulder or lap. So kinda good to hit it off right? But I tried here or there to get closer, i.e. I offered her a massage-for-massage trade or whatnot, but she refused. So I thought cool, she's not into me. Moving on.

926,cactrr,throwaway512199,Is it unreasonable I [F20] want my boyfriend [M21] to be awake before 12pm?,"Hi, context:

My boyfriend has insomnia, and typically stays up very late, but takes medication for it that works very well. We share a bed together and we both sleep through the night undisturbed and peacefully. Typically, my boyfriend will stay up til 1-3AM before coming up to lay down with me, and this is ok, I don't have any quarrels with him doing this. 

However, my boyfriend can go to bed at any time he wants. I know this, because when he feels like it, he'll take his medication around 8 and be fast asleep by 10. Sometimes, he'll even be going to asleep as early as 7. Again, I have no problem with the sleep schedule being irregular, but my main issue becomes the fact my boyfriend does one or the other of this, but will insist on sleeping in until 12.

I don't typically have a lot to do, and have tried to politely encourage him to get up maybe at 11-10 so I can make us both breakfast and start our day, but he refuses and considers me to be unreasonable in this situation. I've tried explaining that I think it would help him, and I'm not asking for a whole lot. I just want to wake up, eat something, and then have lunch at a somewhat normal time and have a routine. I think this would be fundamental to helping our relationship, but my boyfriend fully disagrees.

I don't want to bother him or turn into the nagging, persistent S/O with this, but I think as an adult he can't be sleeping in like this until 12, or even 2pm sometimes. It's absurd, and makes me worry and not to mention partially annoyed. I can't really decide on what to eat or cook until my boyfriend is awake, because I have to include him in meal plans or if we go out somewhere. I typically have coffee and maybe a breakfast bar, but have to sit around until the boyfriend is awake to do anything more.

Am I being unreasonable by wanting my adult boyfriend up by 12? I feel like this isn't asking a lot, but being with someone who has Insomnia, I understand how this could be hard or difficult or appear like I'm being selfish, or otherwise just a pest.

I [M23] have been with my girlfriend [F21]  for about 3 and a half years now. There were times when it was really bad, but it‚Äôs going really well now and I see myself marrying her in the future.

During one of the bad times, I became really close friends with another girl. The thought of what a relationship would be like with her even passed through my mind. However, I never acted on any of my thoughts (other than telling my close friends I had conflicted feelings about my girlfriend/this other girl).

I am still friends with that girl today (I actually met this other girl before I even met my girlfriend) but nothing more, and she never knew I liked her. Do I need to confess to my girlfriend that I told my friends I liked this other girl? Again, I never (physically) acted on anything and I love my girlfriend to bits, but I‚Äôm feeling a bit guilty.

Apart from this, there‚Äôd also been times (long ago) where (particularly when drunk) I‚Äôve been a bit inappropriate/flirty around other girls - but again I‚Äôve never cheated (been physically intimate with anyone else). I‚Äôve sometimes (in the past) lied about who I was meeting for coffee/where I was going, purely because I didn‚Äôt want her to get all irate at me for nothing. She used to be very insecure and emotionally manipulative so I‚Äôd sometimes lie about these trivial things that shouldn‚Äôt matter, but she‚Äôd have made a big deal of them. These things all happened when the relationship was in a very bad place and I really didn‚Äôt see a future with her.

I must stress that this all happened a long time ago (2 years or so), and that it really is going very well now and I do want to be with her in the future. I just want to know whether I need to ‚Äúconfess‚Äù any of this, or whether I can forgive myself and not feel guilty/let it go. I just worry about her somehow finding out about any of it in the future.

TL;DR: Had some conflicting thoughts/done some inappropriate things at bad times during my relationship, but haven‚Äôt cheated. Do I tell her the ‚Äúthings‚Äù I‚Äôve done?

She always brings up her ex and other guys but gets mad at me and not talk to me in weeks.

She accuse me of things

She fake out and lies

I just don't know what to do. Should I just leave her? Why is she acting like this? This is making me depressed and sad. 

So recently she gotten in contact with me and told me the reason why she dumped me was due to far distance, I only live a hour away from her and had no problem getting out there. I honestly don't think thats really the case",2019-07-07 22:18:01,5,3,relationship_advice

932,cacrnz,Forfun200,How to feel comfortable to sexually touch my boyfriend,"I (23F) have been with my partner (25M) for 2 years. It has been quite obvious that he sexually me in the bedroom, whether it be by his hands, toys or oral. However, when it is my turn to ‚Äúreturn‚Äù the favour, I feel disgusted and hate myself.

My ex partner was emotionally, physically and sexually abusive. Once I was able to finish the relationship, I sought out counselling and that was really beneficial to me. I stopped a year later as I felt I was able to continue my life without it.

However, when it comes to the bedroom, I felt like I need counselling again. Part of me feels like because of what my ex did, I have almost a ‚Äòfear‚Äô of touching his genitals.

This sounds crazy, and it makes me feel so shitty as I know I can‚Äôt please him, but I feel physically sick about thinking of doing it. He never pressures me, or asks continuously, he‚Äôs very careful and allows me to take my time and do it how I prefer until I‚Äôm comfortable enough, but it takes so long to be able to get the point of me actually wanting to do it.

Just wondering if there are any tips or ways that can help me to deal with this and become more comfortable? I want to satisfy my partner with my hands/mouth, not just vagina.",2019-07-07 22:16:46,12,1,relationship_advice
933,cacqho,awertbnmh,I [20M] still miss my ex [19F]...,"Probably not as exciting as some of the posts here, but I could really use some help.

So my ex grlfriend and I broke up almost a year ago, at the time the feeling was mutual and the breakup was a long time coming, just no one had the guts to say anything up until that point.

&amp;#x200B;

For months after the breakup we'd still hang out ""as friends"", text every day and frequently hook up,  until we just stopped, I got kinda drunk one night made a few rude jokes at her in front of our friends and she just said that she wasn't going to talk to me anymore.  I was fine with this as I thought that I hadn't done anything wrong and that she had just been overreacting seeing as she would make those kind of jokes at me too.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward again a few months of us not talking at all pretty much, we see each other one night while going out with some friends and we talk a little. During the time that we were talking I began just feeling overwhelmed with this feeling of loneliness and just start thinking about how much I miss her. She asks me to follow her home, I say yes and just begin pouring my heart out and telling her about everything thas I was feeling, she was quite shocked and I could tell that she really cared about me even then. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know what to do about this situation right now, for the past few days I just can't stop thinking about her, even though she told me that she had recently started seeing some guy she had met over tinder. I'm not even sure what I want at this point, do I want her back, do I really miss her or do I just want to keep hooking up with her and I feel like a total asshole. She was my first girlfriend and I do miss just being in a relationship and having someone you can tell everything to and do everything with.

&amp;#x200B;

I should probably leave her alone, but I can't bring myself to do it and I do still think that there's something in her that still feels about me in a way that I feel about her right now. So help me out here, any advice is welcome, do I move on or do I try to get back somehow?

I eventually left for a university 6 hours away, and even though we knew it was going to be difficult we decided to keep dating each other. Due to our conflicting schedules (because she was a high school senior at the time) we didn't talk much, but I tired to do my best and at least send her a few texts everyday, and call her when we could make it work.

During X-mas break when we saw each other again I was very upset and confused with myself because I didn't know what I was doing with my life at college, so I asked her if I could have a week to myself to try and get back in touch with myself (basically alone time to think, being outdoors as much as possible, and putting lots of time into my hobbies to try and find what made me happy and who I was ment to be.) 

I managed to pull myself out of my slump and my gf was waiting for me as I left the dark and confusing fog I was in. We spent as much time together over breaks when I was home from University, and I tried to make more of an effort to talk with her while I was away.

Now that school has been let out for the summer we spend more time together and are trying to appreciate each others company before she leaves for University in late August.

Things felt right to me and I was super excited to be able to see her more again, even though I am working a full time job over the summer. 

She came over to watch the local fireworks on the 4th of July before I underwent oral surgery the next day. It was great being able to lay in the field with her and appreciate just being with her. When we got back to my house she said that she wanted to talk, so we went to my room to get some privacy.

After a while she opened up with what she wanted to say. (I'm going to end up paraphrasing because there's a lot of small stuff that isnt too terribly important.) She said that she has been losing romantic feelings for me for a while, but was too scared to tell me for a while. She isn't entirly sure why she is losing those feelings. I ended up weeping on her shoulder for almost an hour as she spelled out what she would like to happen between us.

Because she still really likes spending time with me and hanging out she wants to still be friends, but she wants to break up. I'm welcome to her house and to hangout whenever I want, but she doesn't want to have a relationship as she enters university because she says it stresses her out with us being apart and not close enough to really visit each other.¬† She said she would invite me to hang out with her and her college friends, even party together, but she would consider getting back together after she gets settled at her university.

I have no idea what to do. I still have massive romantic feelings for her and I love her, but she doesn't see me like that anymore yet she says that she might get back together with me in the near future. I really don't want to end our relationship, but I also don't want to hurt her feelings for what she feels is the right choice. I'm looking for any advice or wisdom that you great people can give me. Thank you so much.

TL;DR: Girlfriend broke up with me after losing romantic feelings for me and worries that having a relationship going into university will stress her out, even though I still love her and tried to keep our relationship alive while I was at college.

So, me (F22) and my ex (M24) just ended our relationship after almost three years. Things had been really bad for a long long time, but neither of us had the balls to end it. The thing is, I already had a bad feeling about us from the very beginning of our relationship. But I was stupid enough to just ignore it, because he was cute, I liked him, and it was so exciting. As the time passed and we got more serious, one thing after the other just popped up and put a big weight on me. Looking back at it, I never really felt like he respected me, not at all actually. And not only did he not respect me, but he made me feel and think that the stupid things he did to me was somehow my fault. And he always made me feel like I was the reason we had problems. Which was bullshit! Almost every problem we had was because of something stupid he did. 

We were really great when it was just the two of us, but we didn't work at all when there were other people around. And that is the biggest sign of all! When you don't feel comfortable with your SO with other people around, the relationship is doomed. And I really don't understand why I couldn't just break things off a long time ago. I've been miserable for so long. And when it finally ended, although it was sad in the moment, the first thing I did when he left was I started laughing. I felt this heavy burden just fall off of my shoulders! It sounds horrible, but breaking up was definitely the best thing that's happened to me in a while. So yeah, if you are in a relationship where the other part make you feel like this, be strong and get away as fast as possible!

(And again, sorry for the bad english! Just felt like getting this off my chest, so I wouldn't risk bursting it out to my ex, since we're trying to stay friends.)",2019-07-07 22:09:42,3,3,relationship_advice

This isn't a total crisis like many other posts with horrible relationship problems, but it still irks me that my friends (all around my age) don't invite me to anything.

All of this has been happening very recently, and even though they assure me we are friends, they don't act like it. 

First time I remember this happening this summer, the first day.

On the last day, I invite all my friends to hang out. They all decline. After that day, I see them all hanging out, I join in, but one guy (15M) tries to express to me how he thinks I shouldn't hang with them. I continue hanging out, and while some of them dont care if I join them or not, at least half of them don't want me there it seems. I eventually  leave because of this. Fast forward 3 days, I'm looking through Snapchat stories. The same friends are all hanging out, watching a firework display. And talking about how awesome it was. Im thinking ""Oh, they didnt invite me. Maybe next time."" I ask to hang out twice on two different days. The answer from the people I asked? Nope, we got plans.
Fast forward to three days ago, they all go see a movie, with Snapchat stories about their fun, once again without even thinking of me. I am really starting to think about whether they are my friends or not, and some advice would help.

945,caclzd,maduper,My [18M] cousin [17M] has not been in (high) school for almost three years and should be graduating next June,"Hello

My cousin ‚Äúrecently‚Äù moved from a suburb of Manchester. It was actually about two years ago when he settled with his family from Salford (Manc.) to rural Lincolnshire.

He has autism/Aspergers (stable, but has some social and learning disabilities) and was pulled out of his suburban high school (that he transferred to from another school) after his first term due to academic difficulties/bullying (presumably, from how he described it)... for about six months he stayed at his home in the suburbs playing video games on his computer and planned on going back to an online/another physical school by the beginning of the next academic year.

His father (my uncle) gets a promotion for his job that March (2017) and moves him and the mother (my aunt) up to the rural Lincolnshire town by June. It‚Äôs summer of 2017 and the family are settled down. However, he still doesn‚Äôt have his new school situation set up by his family.

Mind you that there are academic resources in the rural area, but not of the same level as Manchester with how they originally planned his ‚Äúrestart‚Äù at school.

His mother is the one who handles most of the family‚Äôs logistical things (including my cousin‚Äôs schooling) and hasn‚Äôt been able to find work in the remote town that she originally had . The father just uprooted the family and works... he doesn‚Äôt deal with my cousin‚Äôs schooling. He is stubborn and made the decision to move without consulting the rest of the family. They have had various financial issues over the years and are still trying to find steady ground.

The mother hasn‚Äôt exercised schooling for my cousin since he was pulled out of school December of 2016. He STILL sits at home playing games and doing a few chores here and there. I am the only person outside his immediate family who is in contact with him regularly.

I‚Äôve asked him a few times what his school situation is throughout his tenure of absence and he says he doesn‚Äôt know each time.

Our grandparents have been ignored by my aunt each time they ask why my cousin has not been put in school for so long and everyone else in the family are scratching their heads at this too.

I feel he is being neglected by his parents by at least not having him work his mind with academics with an online school. It will be very hard for him to get a secondary school certification even if he starts up his schooling again now. Socially, he is probably being neglected even more by being sheltered in his house and not interacting with very many people besides his family and a few people on Discord.

With coding and other computer things he has done over the years I‚Äôve seen how brilliant he is in that subject: he is a very quick learner with computers and baffles me in how he can figure things out so well when faced with a computer/gaming problem. He could have his schooling tailored to computer engineering/science (?).

I just feel he could be a functioning adult/teen with a few quirks but his family is holding him back. He ought to complete high school even if he doesn‚Äôt plan on going to university...

My goodness, it‚Äôs July of 2019 already!

I don‚Äôt know if we can do much, but I‚Äôm wondering what my family/I can help him/his parents with to get him back on track with school.

TLDR: my cousin should be graduating high school soon but has not been in school for a few years (due to minor academic problems/moving) and really should be solidified at a high school by now.",2019-07-07 22:02:40,1,1,relationship_advice
946,caclsv,newbeau,Didn't know how to handle a new situation - just shut down,"We are 6 weeks into a new relationship.  I (56F) just had a birthday and he (M58) went overboard with the gifts.  We were going away for a few days to visit with my family and he came over on my birthday to stay the night, then we could get an early start the next day.  My family is friendly and it isn't that unusual for me to bring a new beau for an overnight trip like this (though it's been several years since I've had a boyfriend).

So far there have been a couple of mini-red flags but I figured what the hell with this trip - what better way to get to know someone than a rode trip.  He said he can be overwhelming or too much sometimes and at any time, I could just tell him if he was being that way.  That was the first mini-red flag - I never want to tell a guy how to behave in a relationship.  I get that some things will need to be said, but with this I figured he was already aware of it so why would he need me to tell him if he was being too much.

He comes over with about 7 different gifts and a cake that I didn't want to eat.  One gift was a bracelet that is absolutely not my style and while I'm opening it, he's saying how he knows jewelry is a personal thing but he decided to get this for me anyway.  Then there was a vase we had seen at a shop the previous weekend, that I decided against getting because I really don't have room for it in my house.  And then there was a very large framed print of a poem I shared with him.  He just pulled the image from a google search and it's something I just would not hang on my walls.  Then there was something regarding my business and it isn't really that apropos.  There were a couple other nonsense stuff like he was buying for a Christmas stocking.

I felt overwhelmed but also grateful because he was wanting to be thoughtful and I haven't had any gifts given to me like that in a long while.  And he was staying over for our trip (he lives nearly 2 hours away).  I couldn't make a thing of it right then.  So I just let it go, to be dealt with later.  But I did shut down a bit - no sex that night.

While we are on our visit with my family, I notice a new habit he seems to have -he eats full on, with his mouth open and talks with food in his mouth.  Complete turn off for me.  How am I supposed to tell a grown man to shut his mouth while he eats?!?  I was beside myself.  We've had dinners before but this was a new thing.  I never knew eating grapes could be so fucking loud.  And then there was the burping without so much as an 'excuse me'.

I really did shut down.  There was no holding hands or any sign of affection from me.  I just wanted to leave so badly.

We did have a moment to talk about why I was suddenly acting differently and I mentioned my sensitivities to certain smells and sounds.  He knows about the smells but I tried to use the time to interject the sound part of it (even saying chewing sounds), thinking maybe he would pick up on that the next time he ate.  All he said was he knows all about other people's sensitivities because his ex-wife had all of them.  Their relationship has come up often since we've been seeing each other.

When we finally leave for the long drive home, I'm pretty much silent.  We're listening to music most of the way and any time he does talk I have to say 'what's that?' because he mumbles all the time.  And I have said to him that I can't understand him most of the time.

I am not looking to be a mother to some guy but he seems to want to put me in the position of telling him when he's doing something annoying or wrong (and I don't like using those terms) but that's how he's put it.

By the time we do get to my town, he's really in a snit. He didn't even stay over, he left in a hurry.  While we were driving, he made a few attempts to talk to me about the trip, but I told him I couldn't talk about while driving because I'm not going to talk to the windshield.  After unloading my things, we agreed to talk on Tuesday.  He said a few bizarre things too - like a few things were still in his truck and he said he would just keep them (?)

I feel he is just way to emotionally sensitive than I am and I'm thinking he has some codependency issues.  He sent a long email this morning that I didn't read in its entirety and then a text this afternoon apologizing for it.  I''m not responding to either until Tuesday.

I guess my question is - how should I have handled the open mouth eating (it was in front of my family who were just as horrified) and all those stupid gifts?",2019-07-07 22:02:13,2,1,relationship_advice

A girl I've had a very short ""relationship"" with (we texted for a few days, met up twice and made out for a bit) broke off contact with me after that. A few months later, yesterday, we met up over a bottle of wine by the river to talk about whatever happened I guess. Aside from my general awkwardness it was going relatively good until she revealed to me that the reason she broke off contact with me was that she was raped at a party. After stating this she expected me to say something, which, honestly, I have no idea how to react to that. All the things going through my head sound so dumb and shallow. I ended up saying something along the lines of ""I hope that son of a bitch rots in hell"" which didn't really feel right either. So, what do you say in a situation like this? How do I make her feel better, or at least like, acknowledge it, 'cause really I just sat there in silence thinking of something to say for the most part, which probably made both of us feel pretty bad.",2019-07-07 22:01:48,6,8,relationship_advice
948,cackzp,imasadgirlllll,"I‚Äôm a super sensitive person, he doesn‚Äôt seem to respect me at all","Okay so I‚Äôm just going to jump right in, this may be long so I‚Äôm sorry about that but I would really appreciate any and all advice:)

So, I was in a relationship with someone who treated me amazingly until he started cheating and never stopped. We live an hour away from each other and I had gotten messages from two girls about a month apart asking if we were still together because he had spelt with them. When I called him about it the second time because I was dumb enough to forgive him the first time, he finally confessed and said not only did he sleep with those two girls but he flirted with many more and he said he didn‚Äôt feel guilty. Anyways about a month and a half ago (I think?) we just slowly got distanced and eventually we just assumed we were broken up.. now we‚Äôve talk numerous times and he says he wants to try again and of course I do because I love him ( I know that sounds stupid and I constantly feel like that but feelings are feelings) but I feel he never respected me during our relationship and he had absolutely none for me now.. let me explain. 

When we together he was calling other girls cute and pretty and I‚Äôm not a controlling person in any way but that bothered me and after bringing it up multiple times he continued to and at that point it was no hope and I just ‚Äúlet it slide‚Äù even though I constantly worried about him cheating, then I found out he did:(  and now we‚Äôve had multiple conversations all ending in the conclusion that we‚Äôre not talking to anyone else and we are going to try to eventually get back together but the other day I brought up the fact that him constantly showing off a bunch of female friends online (because he never once showed me off, my thought is probably because they‚Äôre prettier and our age difference is 2 1/2 years and he‚Äôs embarrassed of me..) anyways he said they‚Äôre just his friends and completely ignored the fact that I said it bothered me and other things I said letting out how I felt. He did it once again today and I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that he has no respect for me. And for someone who‚Äôs in love with this horrible man, it hurts really really bad..

I should also add that he keeps asking me when we are going to make plans again because we live an hour away so it‚Äôs not as easy and I told him straight out that I suck at making plans like I feel weird asking people to do things with me and when someone asks ‚Äúwhere do you wanna go‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat do you want to do‚Äù I completely freeze and can‚Äôt think of anything, and he just said ‚Äúokay let me know whenever‚Äù and all I could think is... um I just said I probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to think of plans and would appreciate it if he could think of something and just suggest it (I said it differently in the text) and I just am unsure what to do at this point... I don‚Äôt feel my heart can handle completely letting him go as I have depression and I am trying to heal from everything, but I really don‚Äôt feel like he cares/ has respect for me..

So I guess I‚Äôm just looking for options, opinions, and anyone able to give me advice on trying to fix this or trying to move on without completely cutting him off?

949,cackit,whatshouldido_throw,Am I (36/m) just a sensitive bitch who has been out of the dating scene too long or is my gf (32/f) trifling?,"I need to know if I'm being a sensitive bitch about this or if I have an actual gripe. Please help.

I started dating this girl about a month and a half ago, and things were going great. We got along well and seemed to enjoy each other‚Äôs company. After about a week she came right out and told me‚Äîwith the subject being anything but relevant‚Äîthat she lost weight in January 2019 and then went full-on whore and banged a shitload of guys on the first date. I told her I appreciated the honesty but didn‚Äôt want to hear that. The next night she proceeds to tell me‚Äîagain, with the subject elsewhere, without me asking, and despite my prior trepidation‚Äîabout all the places she‚Äôs banged guys, including the bar she chose for our first date (her ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù), in which we did not bang. I again told her that I appreciated her honesty/transparency, but didn't want to hear about her with other guys‚Äîespecially since *we* didn't bang on the first date. Everybody has a past, I get it. I just don‚Äôt want to have my nose rubbed in it. That was red flag #1.

Every time we hang out we have a good time, but she's always on her phone‚Äîtexting with people, checking IG, FB, etc. It bothers me for some reason; I can't explain it, but it just does. (Perhaps it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve lost touch with a lot of my friends and am a smidge jealous/embarrassed.) This is of course not her fault in any way and she shouldn‚Äôt have to suffer for it, but it is how I feel. Not a red flag by any means, but it‚Äôs something that makes me question the situation.

Another thing is she has a lot of guy friends. This  isn‚Äôt (and shouldn‚Äôt be) a big deal to most people, but I‚Äôve been down this road a few of times before and only pain has emerged. I told myself never again, but I've told myself never again before.

One last thing is she had a longtime friend stay with her last weekend. She told me she wanted me to meet her, but she wanted a day for them. Which, of course. So she picks her friend up in the morning and they have lunch. She and I text throughout the day and they‚Äôre having fun. She texts me at 8 pm and I text her right back, then I don‚Äôt hear from her again until 10 the next morning. Normally I wouldn't think anything of it, but her telling me about her January hoe escapades is in the back of my mind.

So: Is this what I (an introvert) get for dating an extrovert? Am I using my past failed relationships as reasons to sabotage this? Should I bring this stuff up to her? Have I just been out of the dating game too long (got out of a ltr last year) and this is normal? Please help.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks.",2019-07-07 21:58:58,8,2,relationship_advice
950,cacjo2,fabianoid,My husband told me I was a bad Mum and he will feel sorry for our son when he's a teenager,"My husband and I argued today because he did, in my opinion, a very stupid and unsafe thing (he used a European plug in a UK Socket using matches to shove into the top hole to get it to work.....!). This came about because I asked why there were two matches on the kitchen side, so he told me that's what he used them for. 

We've had this conversation before and I asked him not to use the European appliances etc without an adaptor (we have several). We've discussed that it's dangerous and he agreed, saying he wouldn't do it again.

So today after finding this out I calmly told him that I would prefer him not to do it, he said he didn't see that it was a problem. I explained (again) why it is a problem and was met with ""ok whatever"", which I thought was very blas√© and just meant ""ok I'll do it again when you're not home"". We live in a flat that's not on the ground floor with our 5 month old son and pets, a fire would be devastating to anybody and we are no exception. So I told him as clear as I could that I felt that his decision to do this today was reckless and he put our safety at risk by doing so, and that this upset me. I also said that because he didn't listen the first time I imagined he wouldn't listen again. He kept on with the minimal almost childlike responses, not meeting my gaze, bored look on his face, shrugging. I wanted to hear that he had heard me, and that he wouldn't put our safety at risk again by being so reckless. After a bit of an exchange about this, he said that I didn't know when to shut up, that he felt sorry for our son when he gets older because this is what he'll be subjected to, saying that I would be a bad Mum to him. 

Reflecting on this, I'm aware that I felt put into the ""parent vs child"" role here, and that I did eventually revert to the ""critical parent"" in this scenario. But my adult to adult, talking rationally and reasonably didn't seem to be getting me anywhere. Even ""nurturing parent"" didn't get me anywhere because I wasn't met with an understanding, learning, or even acknowledgment. I was aware that I was getting a bit annoyed with how he was responding to me. My own upbringing was very much critical parent vs child so I guess this is a bit of a delicate area for me, and with my son I make conscious efforts to be more loving and gentle with him than the parenting I received, so this feels especially unkind and unloving. On one hand I could have been more gentle with my words and chosen them even more carefully and try to get my point across, but to be honest it sounded like he just wanted me to shut up altogether. And safety is so so so SO important. If anything happened to anyone in our house because of such a stupid action, I would never be able to forgive him, so I feel that trying to explain how important this is was justified. 

I'm so angry and upset with him right now. Safety is so important and I feel hurt by what he said and I'm also upset that I'm married to someone who would manipulate a disagreement like that and take such a low blow. I think it's a low blow that's just intended to ""win"" the argument. Since, he's tried to just talk normally in conversation but I'm too angry for this. He just belittled this too ""ah, the silent treatment"" and that's where we are at right now....",2019-07-07 21:56:48,11,18,relationship_advice

This guy is drastically immature and I knew it was going nowhere- and he ended things with me because since I wasn‚Äôt introducing him to my family or making big moves that I must have been talking to other guys.

954,cacj1r,queensly_,"How to get closure from someone who hates you? F16, M16","Honestly this is quite a long story so I‚Äôm going to try my best to include relevant information.

I was in a close friendship with a male friend, we can call him Ocean, we were super close and I liked him, his girlfriend cheated on him and broke up with him but he didn‚Äôt know about her cheating.

After they broke up, Ocean and I started a sexual relationship, we never really defined it but it was a FWB thing. This happened fitting Easter.

During Easter I told two of my friends about it because I‚Äôve never been in a position like this and I needed advice because Ocean was pressuring me to send pictures that I didn‚Äôt want to send.

When school stared again after Easter, everyone found out, naturally the two of us were shocked but I didn‚Äôt really care because I wasn‚Äôt ashamed but I guess he was since his ex found out as well.

Ocean blamed me for it, I recognise that I was at fault but I apologised profusely, and told him that I didn‚Äôt mean it maliciously and that I‚Äôd do anything to take it back, he wanted space and I gave it to him but at the same time I didn‚Äôt want to leave him alone because I just wanted things to go back to normal. 

Then a month (May) of this awkward period passed and I really wanted to see where he stood. Keep in mind I‚Äôd try to text him and he‚Äôd leave me on read and ignore me so I left him alone and gave him space during that awkward month. 

I was ready to move on  and to go back to normal, so I asked him if we were still friends and he said ‚Äònah dawg, I‚Äôm fine‚Äô. My heart was broken, it felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe. 

Ever since May I‚Äôve been in such a bad place, I‚Äôd randomly remember memories of him and I together and I‚Äôd start crying, I spent a month coming to terms of all the flaws and mistakes I made while we were friends and I‚Äôm ready to move on but I‚Äôve been self sabotaging myself.

But not with her, everytime i spend with her makes me so happy and relaxed. I have been fighting depression for sometime now and whereas my other friends avoid discussing more serious topics, she's so open to discussion and really listens to what I have to say. I can gush about her for hours on end. I love her a lot and want to have her as a lifelong friend/partner, though I'm not sure if I can differentiate between platonic love and romantic love.

I have suggested this to him in the past, because he has a few things he needs to work on being;

1. He struggles to communicate in a healthy way (i.e name calling, yelling, easily frustrated) 
2. He has many insecurities that are effecting the relationship in a negative way (i.e what I wear, going to the gym alone, looking at my phone, etc) 
3. Struggles to accept responsibility for his actions, and often blame shifting (has improved immensely as of recently, but still an issue). 

We have discussed therapy for his problems in the past, and he would act interested but never follow through. However after I ended the relationship recently he did a complete 180. Insisted on booking the appointments and said he will go to work through these issues. 

My problem is he super persistent I come with him, he says it will be extremely helpful. While I want to support him, I suggested he should ask the therapist what he/she thinks is the best strategy. But he insists he wants me to come. 

My issue with this is in the past when therapy was mentioned he would freak out and insist I was the one who needed therapy, but would later apologize and say he realizes this isn‚Äôt true but it his hard for him to be the sole issue. I‚Äôm worried he is persistent on me going to do his usual blame shifting, rather than for it to be helpful.

961,cacf1s,Remote_Plastic,I‚Äôm [24] feeling confused after after my gf [23] revealed to me that she‚Äôs deeply religious,"Posting on a throwaway account for this.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôll try to make this short, but doubt that will happen. Basically, my girlfriend and I rarely get to see each other because of distance and conflicting schedules. We both live at home with our folks at the moment and that only adds to the frustration. Because of the lack of privacy and the difficulty in seeing each other, it‚Äôs rare that we ever get any intimate time alone.

&amp;#x200B;

This weekend we went on an outing and had a private place to ourselves, but she rejected my advances and told me she wasn‚Äôt comfortable enough for sex right now because she was dealing with a lot of anxiety related to school / work. That‚Äôs fine and I absolutely do not want to make her feel uncomfortable or pressured, so we stopped everything for the night.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that I don‚Äôt remember the last time we had sex. It must‚Äôve been months at this point and honestly, it‚Äôs becoming a problem for me. I don‚Äôt resent her for not wanting to have sex or not feeling well enough to. It‚Äôs something we both have to be totally up for otherwise it just doesn‚Äôt feel right. There absolutely needs to be consent from both of us. I feel like I‚Äôve been good to her and supported her through a lot, I don‚Äôt pressure her into things and I‚Äôve made it a priority to discuss all our feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I‚Äôm finding my sex drive hard to control and it‚Äôs something I feel totally alone in. When we used to be in school together our relationship and sex life used to be a lot better. Now sex just feels like a one-sided chore I rarely get to experience. It feels awkward even bringing up in conversation because it just makes me feel guilty for wanting it. I know no one is owed sex but I miss it and I miss that side of our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Later after returning home from our trip, we spoke over the phone and she opened up to me. She mentioned that she really was feeling a lot of anxiety lately, but she‚Äôs also been afraid of god and feels like it‚Äôs seriously impacted her relationship to sex as well as her anxiety. This took me by surprise because I always knew she was a little religious (I‚Äôm agnostic and religion/faith doesn‚Äôt play a role in my life) but I didn‚Äôt know she was this effected by it all. She went on to say that lately she‚Äôs been afraid of the world ending and her place in the coming judgement. She‚Äôs afraid of going to hell and that her friends (including me) probably won‚Äôt make it to heaven since we don‚Äôt believe in god. Her family even told her that she should think about our future together since I don‚Äôt share their faith and I probably won‚Äôt be joining her in the afterlife. She revealed all of this to me late at night and while I was pretty damn exhausted, this revelation kept me up all night long. She‚Äôs never been someone to have beliefs like this, yet she told me she‚Äôs been keeping this bottled up for a years because she feared being seen as crazy and was so deeply affected by it all lately that she needed to share it with me since she had no one else. She said she was afraid to tell me in the past out of fear that I would break up with her over it all.

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate her bravery in opening up to me, but I still can‚Äôt wrap my head around it. She said she‚Äôs still struggling with it all and while she wants to make god a priority in her life, it conflicts with other things she believes in (i.e.: equality for all, acceptance of LGBT people, etc). I‚Äôm having a hard time rationalizing all of this and it‚Äôs making me feel awful. It feels weird to know that my girlfriend‚Äôs family thinks I‚Äôm going to hell for eternity and it‚Äôs hard to just accept things now in our relationship. I don‚Äôt believe some biblical end of times is coming, we may die from climate change but I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs some divine punishment.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue here is that I thought a lack of sex and intimacy was souring me in this relationship, but then it just revealed this whole other side to things that I never knew existed. I feel totally confused and helpless and I have no idea what to even do going forward. I‚Äôm not really comfortable with all this religious stuff since I‚Äôm completely devoid of any belief. The fact that I feel ignored sexually makes me feel guilty, alone, and insanely frustrated, but this has just totally confused me further. The thought of breaking up has crossed my mind, but that would truly hurt and I don‚Äôt know if it would make me happier. She admitted to me that she didn‚Äôt want this to cause us to break up and was deeply afraid of that, but I‚Äôm feeling so lost. I‚Äôve never seen this side of her. I feel like this will negatively influence our relationship further and I‚Äôm not prepared for it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: my long-term girlfriend and I are rarely intimate and the lack of sex makes me feel frustrated and alone. She‚Äôs been going through a lot of anxiety lately and hasn‚Äôt been interested in it, but also just revealed to me that she‚Äôs deeply religious and has withheld this from me for years. This whole new side of her scares me and makes me feel even more alone.",2019-07-07 21:44:53,9,4,relationship_advice

Issue : She is always hot and cold... we get serious meet parents etc and then she randomly withdraws completely. Her texts are totally garbage like 3 word responses to paragraphs. She won‚Äôt put in effort when we are together, will be completely silent. I will try to ask her if there is anything on her mind in a very polite way.

A good 6-7 months into the wedding I got to know how serious her mental condition was when she had one of the episodes. I tried helping her as much as I could. I was genuinely in love with her and was invested heart, soul, mind and body into the relationship. Fast forward, 6 months back, both me and her were staying at her parents place and she had an extremely bad episode where for a couple of days she just went AWOL and wouldn't tell me where she went. She became very physically aggressive, she had to be institutionalized for 3 weeks. I realized at that point, no matter what I do, no matter how much positivity I bring into her life,  I will eventually find myself in this spot again, where I am genuinely scared for her and what she might do. Thats when I made the hard decision to divorce her. It was an extremely hard decision after I spent the better part of 2 years being physically, emotionally, financially invested in this person. 

How do I move on with my life? No one at work knows about this and I am embarrassed to bring it up. All I ever wanted was someone who I could grow old with and raise a couple of kids. Now I feel, my life is ruined and my shot at happiness gone. I feel very resentful towards her (I constantly remind myself its not her fault, but I find it hard to forgive her). I've always prided myself on being a mentally strong person but I find myself despairing sometimes. Any advice on how to move on?",2019-07-07 21:40:18,1,1,relationship_advice

970,caccq7,pm0118,Cancelled Engagement (29M),"My girlfriend found out that I was going to propose to her on our vacation. (Her coworker saw me coming out of the jeweller) - When she asked me about it, I said that it seemed like the best time to do it. She disagreed. Now, a little bit of back story.

We've been seeing each other and living together for almost 2 years. We talk about the future like it's set in stone. She has told me, and even her friends, in the past 'If he proposed to me right now, I would say yes'

Seems straight forward enough, right?

Anyways, instead of asking to hold off and wait for another time.. She asked me to return the ring. So I did. No big deal. Grabbed a little extra spending money and had a fantastic time for two weeks. I spoke to her about it, while we were over there. The sun was setting and while I was thinking 'This would have been a great moment' I told her, 'Nothing has changed. I still feel the same way'

We get back from holidays, and she tells me that she doesn't feel the same way about me like she used to.. With another 3 hours driving ahead of us

I didn't push, but I asked why and received the classic ""It's not you. It's me. Maybe I've changed"" - I suggested that maybe the commitment scared her and she also said maybe. So, I told her that we'd take it slow. Day by day. No pressure

Only now, I certainly notice a difference in her and lack of affection. The bedroom was on fire 5 nights a week. Now it's for sleeping. There are moments of us, certainly.. But I feel she's seperating herself from me the majority of the time 

So, if I'm going to go down, I'll go down swinging. I can't think about what else I can do, as I feel I'm already being the best version of myself.. But at least I can say that I fought for this. Even if it is or was one sided

Maybe she'll come back around, but I'm preparing for the worst

Edit: I appreciate all your comments and how you would react or how you have reacted in the past to this situation. The truth is, I'm a fool for her. She's got me 100% until whatever happens. In the past, when a relationship has went wrong, I've cut all communication. I basically told her that when the time comes to make a decision, be positive about it, because once I'm gone, she'll never hear from me again. And that's just me, people. That's how I handle breakups.. So you may understand why she's stringing this along.. Or, I hope, really trying to evaluate things. She's knows that when she loses me, I'm lost entirely. I saw something in her. I saw what we could be, I'm not getting any younger. I've wasted years in relationships. This was it for me and we were mutually on track for that.. Until a short time ago.

So I'll be a pussy about it, I guess. And hope. Maybe it's not what she wants now, but that's not my decision to make.. And I'll be here until she figures it out. Another lesson will be learned and another chapter will begin. Maybe I am setting myself up for defeat, but I'd rather spend those last days with her than not at all. I want this, so I'll persevere",2019-07-07 21:38:53,34,111,relationship_advice
971,caccjl,happylittlesunshinee,I (23F) have no desire or energy to talk to my friend (23F),"Background Info: My (23F) friend (also 23F) have been friends with each other since we were 16. Went to the same high school and would hang out during school breaks. Since going to colleges far away, we have of course stayed friends but are the types of people who will go like over a month without talking and then hang out and it's like nothing has changed. Since we graduated from college last year, we have both moved back to our hometowns and have continued to hang out on a more regular basis. She started grad school last year, I applied to grad school to start this year, all was well.

In April 2019, a medical condition I was dealing with for about five months all of a sudden got out of control and it turned chronic/pain on a daily basis/no medications were working etc. My friend was super understanding/let me vent to her etc. At that point in time, I had gotten accepted into an intense grad school program and was starting to think about deferring for about a year because I just could not control my symptoms and the program was starting in a couple of months.

Then in mid-May, my friend and I were texting and she announced to me she was dropping out of her grad school. The details don't really matter, but I texted her for about an hour basically trying to comfort her and let her vent and tell her she was doing the right thing for herself.

In June 2019, all was going pretty much normal. She knew I was still struggling with my condition since I had to let her know I wasn't feeling up for going out with her. We texted about that and then she didn't get back to me for two weeks (even though she posted on social media like every couple of days). This didn't really bother me because I know she is a tad forgetful, but I was still slightly annoyed.

In mid June 2019, I finally made the decision to not go to school this year because of the medical issue. I texted her about it and I just got an answer like two days ago. It was basically something along the lines of how great gap years are and then she asked me if I wanted to hang out this week. Since I originally sent the message a couple weeks ago, she's posted on all of her socials, including a long ass post about how she is choosing to drop out of school and how hard the decision is and yadayadayada; which proves to me that she understands the stress of a decision to defer/drop out of a grad school program.

I'm upset because when she told me her news, I was there for her to talk to her about it, but when I make a similar decision, she ignores my message for weeks. In my opinion, both of us had major, serious decisions to make. Also, she is the kind of person to check her phone multiple times when we hang out. She also has told me she much prefers texting over calling.

I genuinely don't think she is doing this out of malice, but I am just not sure if she's actually doing this because she accidentally forgets. I don't really have any desire to text her back because I have a really busy week coming up and I don't want to deal with someone who I feel like has been almost ignoring me for like a month. However, I don't know if I should to just like get it over with and not cause any other big problems. On the other hand, I'm like well she obviously doesn't care too much about responding at a fast rate so what does it matter if do the same thing? I feel so petty, but at the same time I just feel like I need a break. I also just don't know if I care enough to even talk to her about this (at least right now).

I trust their expertise but I don't trust their desire to get a fast resolution.  Delaying or coming up with ways to introduce new concepts that don't further your case.  But what made me ask this question is my utter distrust of the pharmaceutical industry.  I read an article not that long ago about how they view the safety of their drugs and the odds that people will die using their products.  They actually factor a contingency into their pricing based on the idea that they will probably get sued because people will get sick or die.  Commercials are the worst.  They show people having a wonderful and serene life while in the background the narrator is listing the potential side effects as if they were inconsequential and in a voice you'd use to tell someone what an interesting visit you had at the museum today.   The side effects are sometimes life threatening, maybe cause hallucinations, birth defects, cancer, explosive diarrhea, blindness, and the always popular memory loss.

I went through a relationship with deeply love -i guess- for 3 months until she accused me for treating her like a bitch and broke-up with me. After that I finally end my endless thinking circle about my love about her and decided to i'm truly loving her. I found weed guilty and promise to end that habit. But found she already date with someone else that 2 week break time. I said to finish that and she do what i want. After that we come together somehow.

Now we basicly living together but i'm feeling she only satisfied when her demands accomplished. I'm feeling like i need to show extra commitment. She always desire to treat like a princess. I agree with her about i'm really cold person but i have to be sure what she really is for act like that.

She can easily say bitch to some of our mutual friend from their social media profile. I'm not using any of them but i saw she is also has related posts on her own. Maybe reduced numbers of that kind posts but still same isn't it?

I can't trust her after that experiences but i think i'm still loving her. Do I need to fight for better or quit already? I'm currently leaving process from weed so i can't decide or think about even simpliest things because of brain fog. Last time i argued her about clothes she's wearing but middle of that i was already changed my mind. She still agreed with me what i say anyway.

What do you guys think?

974,cacbuz,lilbebe50,I have to choose between 2 girls and I don't know what to do...,"This is a long story, so I'll just try to summarize it the best I can. I have been talking to a girl, S, for a year now. Fell in love with S and her daughter. S has not felt ready to make things official and so for the past year we've been ""talking"" and going out once every couple of weeks. I want to see her more, but she blows me off, or always has some excuse to not see me more, despite saying she loves seeing me etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Back in May, I cut things off with S after being blown off again after she had promised she was going to really make an effort this time. I was drunk just a few days later, sad, depressed and feeling rejected and started to message random girls on Facebook which is when I started to talk to C. 

&amp;#x200B;

C is young, 21, I'm 25 and have never dated younger than me. She's attractive. But I'm still in love with S. S has since found out that I'm seeing C, and since I'm friends with S still, she's asked me questions about C to which I've told her the truth, and she's admitted she's jealous of C. I broke things off with C about 2 weeks ago because I told her the truth and told her that S and I were friends before we started talking, we used to work together, and will continue to be friends and that I did not want to rush into anything serious because I needed time to sort through my feelings and get over S. C started to back off and she blew me off and I reacted in anger and cut her off.

&amp;#x200B;

I gave it a few days and thought about it and realized that it was my fault for not treating C as well as I should have because I still have feelings for S and C was blowing me off to protect her own feelings. I apologized to C, we hung out 3 days in a row and she even slept over. We did not have sex, I haven't had sex with S either.

&amp;#x200B;

C wants to have sex. She keeps alluding to it. I haven't had sex in a year. So as you can imagine the sexual frustration lol S asked if C slept over and I told her yes and she seemed quite bothered about it but I told her we didn't have sex. 

&amp;#x200B;

It gets a bit more complicated because I'm a woman. S is bi, C is a lesbian as well. I have heard that S only plays with girls but will not have a relationship with one and saves relationships for men. I confronted her about this and she said other than me there has only been one other woman she pursued, she's not ashamed being interested in me or the fact she's dated and been with men. Then said she feels like I could do better than her because she's a mess.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in a bind. I am in love with S. We have an intellectual connection. We can talk and text all day about any and everything. She understands the stresses of my job. C does not understand because she hasn't experienced my job. But C is ready to be with me. I have been waiting for S for a year, and haven't really gotten anywhere, and now this whole other factor of whether she would even have a serious relationship with a woman. She tells me I'm perfect, I'm doing everything right, she enjoys spending time with me, she loves me etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like if I were a man, S would have no qualms being with me. I know she's slept with women before. She said before me and the other girl that the women she would mess with were all fun and games until a relationship was brought up and then she'd back off.

&amp;#x200B;

Considering it's already been a year, I can safely say I know she cares about me. She's had an abusive past which plays into a lot of her trust issues and insecurities. I just don't know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need to have a serious sit down conversation with S and tell her I've been waiting for her for a year. Either we are together or we're only friends, I'm not doing this ""talking"" thing anymore. It's not fair to me to sit around at home pining over her and wondering when the next time I'm gonna see her. C is ready to be with me now, and it's not fair of me to hurt C. I'm afraid that I'll choose S over C and S will just go back to doing her same old things again and I will have ruined a potentially good relationship for me. But I have never felt the way I felt about S with anyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I need to have a serious talk with S about all of this, but its hard getting her alone and without her daughter just to see her to have a serious talk. The things I want in a relationship, C can offer me. And it's bittersweet because I want that with S. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is greatly appreciated. I don't want to hurt anyone in this, but I know someone is bound to get hurt.",2019-07-07 21:36:46,5,2,relationship_advice
975,cacbpx,fmldudette,"Under 16, in desperate need of emotional reassurance from strangers, and wants to reconnect with estranged siblings befor it‚Äôs too late","Bear with me for a sec. I‚Äôm under 16, so I‚Äôm only just coming to realise this as an issue for me and my family, but I‚Äôm part of a large family and I‚Äôm really estranged (will explain further later)  from all of my siblings, and I really want to try and reconnect/reforge these relationships before they‚Äôre beyond repair. 

So my older siblings are very talkative and friendly with each other but I‚Äôm the odd one out. My older brother especially still resents me for being a total bitch when I was younger (which is fair) and we have very few interests in common so I‚Äôm not sure how to try and like hang out and stuff. 

When I was younger (7-12, and still have some issues) I was extremely sensitive emotionally and had a lot of selfishness and control issues. I was really picky and would throw fits or cry at like everything, I would guilt my parents and siblings into doing things for me, etc. Basically I was a total asshole, which I‚Äôm trying to work on now, but I feel like years of being a selfish jerk when I was younger are now coming to haunt me. I just am very impulsive so I can be quite immature or selfish because I don‚Äôt think rationally or about long-term consequences. 

Anyway, my older siblings are very opinionated, extremely smart, and loud, and can sometimes be overbearing. Because my older brother can sometimes be a bit arrogant and likes arguing, talking in family settings stresses me out and I have trouble coming up with things to say. Outside of home, I‚Äôm on my school debate team so arguing isn‚Äôt necessarily a problem for me, but carrying on normal conversation I find really hard. I‚Äôm happy to listen to other people‚Äôs conversation, especially at home, but whenever I say anything at home my older siblings get me to shut up. I have a lot of trouble carrying on small talk etc. According to a psychologist I visited a few years ago I might be on the spectrum so that might have something to do with it but it‚Äôs nevertheless a bit issue of mine. 

My siblings don‚Äôt want to hang out with em if they‚Äôre not forced to by family convention. It‚Äôs widely acknowledged in my family that I‚Äôm not well liked. As for school, my situation there isn‚Äôt best either. I‚Äôm aware I can be a very needy friend but whenever anyone seems they like me it‚Äôsu realistically fulfilling because of how little it ever happens to me. That said it doesn‚Äôt actually ever happen lol z

Because of my often self centred impulsivity and  conversation issues I‚Äôve never really connected on a deep level with like friends and stuff, or even in my family anyone apart from my parents, and even then on their part probably only because they‚Äôre obligated to love me. My siblings, though they‚Äôre extremely close with each other clearly dislike me, which I understand, but I do want to be closer with them and am trying t figure out how to change for the better. 
Right now I feel supremely unlovable and I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to change myself so that I can be a better person. 

I know it‚Äôs early to say this but I‚Äôve never felt really appreciated or loved by any human being other than my parents. It‚Äôs not just teenage angst. If even my siblings, who are very kind and understanding people who have given me countless more chances to be a good person than anyone else is obligated to, don‚Äôt even like me, I can imaging anyone else is likely to. I don‚Äôt have anywhere in my life to really express this but I feel so very alone, and I‚Äôm not sure how to solve my problems. This is an issue that‚Äôs been plaguing me for years, but I kept ignoring it because I thought it was something that could grow with time. It hasn‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

tl;dr I need advice / help on how to reconnect with siblings and try and form better relationship before it deteriorates further",2019-07-07 21:36:23,3,0,relationship_advice

979,cac9yr,ThrowawaySC876,My (20f) best friend (21m) sprained my wrist during an argument,"I'm at a loss for how to handle this friendship. My best friend has been at my side for the past two years since we started college and has become a brother to me. We have both been through so much together, from the death of his teammate/good friend, my friend getting cancer, and even the smaller events, me driving him to sports practice and him looking out for me when we go out or making sure i'm always happy. He is one of the most selfless people I have ever met and when my boyfriend can't make events due to sports (both athletes) he will take me to dinner or out downtown just to take my mind off of it, no questions even asked. I could go on and on about the things he's done for not just me but people he is close to, but there's one aspect about him that i just can't shake: his aggression. He's extremely giving, but over the past two years i've seen how quick he is to become angry, almost as if it's out of his own control. Here are a few examples for perspective:

&amp;#x200B;

1. the first time he ever yelled at me was when his teammate died after getting into a motorcycle accident. his teammate had actually called him a few times before his death, but he missed the calls because we had gone out drinking and he was taking care of me (note i didn't ask him to and we had plenty of friends there with us). After the news broke, he avoided me for the whole day the morning after during which i tried to contact him over text and call but he never answered. I then went over to his apartment to make sure that he was alright. when he saw me in person he screamed at me, blaming me for his teammates death and saying if i wasn't so reckless and he hadn't had to take care of me that maybe he could have done something to help. I was in shock and what he said immediately brought me to tears, but I understood that he was grieving.  After another week, he apologized for this and i forgave him.
2. Next, during our lab session, he was my partner and we needed help figuring out a part of our lab. I asked one of the assistants numerous questions, however, he didn't know the answer to any of them. Admittedly, this was frustrating, but I just asked other around us and we figured it out, no problem whatsoever. However, after i had asked the lab assistant for a third or fourth time and he claimed he did not know, my friend yelled at him (not at the same scale as the previous story) saying ""what the hell do you know then?"" the entire room got quiet, and he proceeded to berate the poor lab assistant even making him feel so bad that he agreed to bring us the ANSWER KEY. I told him that it was fine and we can figure it out, but he told me i was naive and just as clueless about how to handle problems. I didn't want to make a bigger scene and didn't know what to say so i just stayed quiet and left the lab feeling so bad for the assistant ( i even apologized to him on his behalf after i saw the assistant crying)
3. This previous weekend was one that really hurt me. we had planned a get together with our friends at his apartment and to go to our universitys golf course afterwards. He told me that i had been ignoring him (which i did not try to do at all) and wouldn't take no for an answer when i told him i had to do my homework (my grades had been slipping and i needed to maintain a certain gpa to be able to continue playing on my sports team) I eventually agreed to come, but told him i would have to do a few problems first to which he said fine. Cut to the get together, everyone is having a great time, but we run out of wine coolers. He had an extra case at my apartment and asked me to go over and bring them, to which i said no problem. However, i was in the middle of talking to someone, and after i finished the conversation i was about to go get them. He meets me at the door and says that he would get them himself since i could never prioritize him/do anything for him. I was confused, because i had agreed to go and i told him such and he started yelling and said that i clearly didn't want to leave. At this point his teammates tell him to relax and i did not want to be there, so i slipped out the door and grabbed the wine coolers. After this, i came back to do some problems in his room while the other were relaxing in the living room. I was working, when all of a sudden he barged into the room and starts yelling. He said ""what the hell is taking so long"" and when i told him i was stuck he told me that he would help. he grabbed the pencil out of my hand and starts writing the problem down super fast, and i wasn't following his explantation (i have adhd and just generally am not great at math, i've struggled with school and he knows about this too) he then yelled at me because i didn't understand the problem and berated me for not understanding the subject until i started crying to which he then stopped. He also claimed that i was holding everyone else up although our tee time was an hour and a half away and when his teammates came into the room after he started yelling he claimed that ""i was holding everyone up and that i always do this"". He knew that i would leave my work and go if the time came up and his teammates even said that themselves. After that, i decided to pack up my bag and just head home i told them i wasn't feeling too good, and as i tried to leave my friend followed me and yelled at me saying you're really going to make this scene? i told him i wasn't feeling good and as i left to go down the stairs he grabbed my arm/wrist and i fell, causing my wrist to get sprained. after he realized what happened he let go and said he would grab me ice, i told him to forget it and left to go home.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to handle this situation or what's gotten into him. I honestly don't even know what to say at times because im scared he will yell at me more or cause a bigger scene. Im very nonconfrontational and ive told him before that i dont deal with yelling well at all, so he knows this about me too. im just at a loss for how to deal with these situations. I've talked to some of my friends about this but they say that there are two sides to every story and that maybe i am missing something or did something that i was unaware of. I'm not sure if i am overreacting or am wrong? I try to apologize but sometimes i don't even know what to say. im very friendly and dont like when friends are upset with me/want to resolve problems, but in these cases i don't know what to do. it's even gotten so bad that i thought he could be on steriods or some sort of drug that effects his personality? this may be a strecth, but out of the whole time i have known him, i've never known him to be physical like this at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: my best friend who is otherwise one of the best friends i have had in my life, is very agressive and yells at me knowing that i am nonconfrontational.

980,cac9v0,Sadboiactual,Long distance relationship is stressing me [20m] out so much that I have stated to lose hair.,"Posting on a throw away account.
I am a 19m and I am in the military. I was home for Christmas last year, walking through a book store and I saw a girl [18f] who I thought was cute so I asked her for her Snapchat. She gave it to me and we started talking and hit it off. Unfortunately, I was leaving soon after that so we didn't get the chance to hang out again. Fast forward a couple of months and we have been talking non-stop and have decided that we should make it official and start dating. Everything was going great for a few more months, and that's when she started acting strange. She seemed distant, and whenever we would FaceTime, or talk on the phone she always seemed cold. I brought this up once, and she told me that she handles things differently and that she was just sad and that there was nothing I could do to help, and to just keep trying to talk to her like nothing was wrong. This went on for a week, and I was always worried that she was upset with me for something. So I finally brought it up again, and she told me what was really bothering her. She said she was someone who needed stability and asked me if it bothered me that I would only be home once or twice a year for a few weeks. I told her that, yes of course it bothered me, but I never really stopped to think about how much it could affect her, because I am around separation all the time. Me, and all of my peers are always separated from our loved ones, so I guess we all just got used to it, and we all have each other to rely on. This conversation was very civil and went back and forth for about 45 minutes. I told her that I didn't want this to be the last time we talked but I am terrified that it might be. To which she replied ""I think it might have to be."" So we said our goodbyes and both went to sleep. I couldn't keep this girl off my mind in the days that followed, so I picked up the phone and called her. We agreed to that we both loved each other and that we would try again, and to take it day by day until I come home again. Months have passed now, and she still gets into moods where she will be very distant and cold, and it kills me inside that I cannot do anything to help. Everytime I ask her if she is okay, it seems to make it worse and she shuts me out. Some days, she will be in a fantastic mood, and it will be great, but more often than not, she is sad about something. So I'm left stressed and worrying that I am going to say the wrong thing and make her sad, or do the wrong thing while she is sad, and make it worse. The stress has really started to take a toll on my body. My hair has been thinning at an alarming rate, and I am losing weight. I love this girl, and I only worry so much because I care about her. I'm a few weeks from coming home now, and I don't want to give up, but my friends are starting to notice the changes in me now, I'm not as happy as I used to be. But when I can catch her in a good mood, I am the happiest I have ever been. I want to tough it out for these last few weeks to see her again, but a lot of my friends have been telling me that she is not good for me.
What should I do?

I went NC for 5 months, then did it again for another few after because I felt I made a mistake in talking to her again.  We spoke again until the end of last year maybe once a month.  I stopped messaging her at the start of the year because I was initiating all the time and I wanted to see what would happen.  She then re-followed me on Instagram at the end of January and started initiating conversation.  Initially it was about a show we used to watch together.  Then a month later she started messaging me about random stuff, apparently she had been at this place I was at for a meeting around the same time I was.  This was the last time I really made an attempt at conversation with her, although our back and forth was generally spread out hours at a time.  A few days after she was messaging me to tell me about this job she got, apparently it reminded her of a joke we used to make.    Later that month she told me that she was supposed to go to this event I was at that I had posted about on my Instagram but couldn't because of work.  She then did smaller things like sending me ""100"" emojis in response to food I posted on my story.  I hadn't been entertaining much of a conversation during the last few times and generally gave polite but dead end responses.  

&amp;#x200B;

Today after 3-4 months of nothing she replied to one of my stories about a location I was working at today.  Despite the lack of direct conversation she was watching all of my stories on Instagram.  I'm working with one of her friends.  We don't really talk about her beyond having acknowledged we both know her a few months ago, apparently she told him that she knows me but I didn't ask any further.  She had worked a that place with him too at one point.  Me and her talked a bit, again delayed responses mostly.  I've cut the conversation because I felt the conversation was coming to a close.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in no rush to meet again, I haven't seen her in nearly a year and half.  I don't have feelings for her anymore.  I have no idea as to what her relationship status is but I don't really care a great deal either.  She's essentially one of those people I keep at a distance.  I've met a few other girls since.

985,cac8in,roonslime,"My (20sM) girlfriend (20sF) has gained a lot of weight recently and it's having negative impacts on our relationship, but she has a history of bulimia and I don't know how to approach the situation","My girlfriend and I have been together for a few months, and I love her very much. She's sweet, funny, and smart, and I wouldn't want any of that to change. Let me preface this by saying that these qualities are what I value most about her, and that I feel really shitty even raising this issue, but I really need to figure it out.

Since we started dating, my girlfriend has gained about 30 pounds. I know that doesn't sound like much, but she's naturally quite petite, and it shows a lot. 

She notices the gain more than anyone else, and it's making her miserable. Every time she gets dressed in the morning she gets freshly upset because her clothes don't fit, and her anxiety has spiked enormously in the past few weeks. 

Don't get me wrong- I understand that peoples' weights fluctuate, and that a temporary increase due to stress or other factors isn't something I should make a huge deal out of, especially with a partner I really care about. In fact, if she was making a real effort to turn it around, I wouldn't even notice or care.

But she isn't showing any signs of stopping. Her eating habits have gotten terribly unhealthy, and she's been drinking way more than usual- mostly highly caloric beer. To make matters worse, she barely exercises.

The real problem is that it's starting to harm other aspects of our relationship. She's perpetually anxious about it, and takes a lot of that out on me. Our sex life has slowed to a crawl. She's depressed, and it's hard for me to create enough positivity to keep up with that. I am also a very active guy, and fitness is important to me. I hate to say it, but It's hard for me to maintain my normal levels of attraction to someone who is taking such poor care of their body.

Now, broaching the topic of dealing with someone's weight gain is never fun. But to make matters especially complicated, she has a long history of bulimia. I feel like if I try to deal with this situation in any capacity, she will take it very hard, and relapse. The last thing I want is to have any attempt at a solution backfire and end up putting her in an even worse place.

I love her, and i just want her to feel like herself again. Any advice?

TL;DR gf's recent weight gain is making her miserable, but I feel like approaching the subject will cause her to relapse into bulimia",2019-07-07 21:28:27,5,3,relationship_advice

988,cac79f,iheartdopamine,My boyfriend (33M) just broke up with me (26F),"I met my boyfriend in October on Tinder. We met for coffee and hit it off right away. We both have the same weird sense of humour and just seem to get each other. We made things official in January and it was a big deal for me because I'd never been in a relationship before. The past few months have been great, we live pretty close to each other so we were able to spend a few nights a week and most weekends together and had met each others families. We had both said I love you and were making plans for the future. I thought things were going well. A few weeks ago he seemed to get a bit more withdrawn, not staying over and cancelling plans. He was having a really tough time at work so I just attributed this behaviour to work stress. Last week he told me to call him when I got home from work. When I did he said that his head was all over the place and he didn't see this working out, we met for a chat and he told me he thought we were becoming more like friends than being in a relationship. To be honest, this completely blindsided me, I didn't see it coming at all. He said he needed some time to think so I've tried to give him some space this past week which has been really difficult. We met up yesterday and he ended things for good. I'm so confused because he kept apologising and saying that I was great and he really enjoyed being with me but he had this feeling that it wasn't going to work because he's gone through this loads of times and he didn't want to 'waste my time' and end it a few months down the line. I told him multiple times that we could work on things but he'd made his mind up. I don't know what to do. This is my first break up, and with someone I truly love.

Most of the personal issues should be resolved in the next few weeks or so and in theory so should the anxiety for now. But their attitude worries me.

995,cac006,ironmanfryingpan,I‚Äôve been in love with my close friend for a while and I‚Äôm going to tell her,"Sorry in advance for the long read.


I‚Äôve know known her since freshman year of high school (4 years ago) and we still talk to this day. I started liking her a couple weeks after meeting her and my feelings have just been getting stronger ever since. To the day I die, I will regret not having the balls to tell her how I felt about her back then. 

She‚Äôs perfect in my eyes in every way. I fell in love with her attitude, how chill she is, how open she is, how helpful and strong she is. I never want our conversations to end and just looking at her puts butterflies in my stomach and my heart beat faster. I‚Äôve never met anyone like her. I‚Äôd give up the world and then some just for her. But I don‚Äôt think she feels the same way towards me. 

She had her eyes set on this one guy in my school known for just fucking and moving on but nothing came of it. Finding this out hit me like a truck but I stuck by her side because I thought being her friend at the very least is good enough for me. 

She left my school halfway through sophomore year and it devastated me. I couldn‚Äôt even tell her how I felt on her last day at the school. All I could do was give her a necklace I bought the day before for her and hug her goodbye. I started talking to her best friend at the time only because I thought i lost the love of my life. I started going out with her best friend shortly after and things were going smooth, until she texted me out of no where and asked if I wanted to go to her birthday party. I said yes immediately and went and had the time of my life. The dress she wore had me breathless. I remember that day like it was yesterday. A couple of her friends were there but I only focused on her. 

After the party, her best friend was mad at me that she wasn‚Äôt invited and that I went. She‚Äôd hold that against me and start talking shit about the girl I really loved up until I ended things at the beginning of senior year. This was also around the time I found out that my close friend had gotten a boyfriend. That news hurt me more than any other news I‚Äôve received in a couple years. But since I was single again and could hang out with her now without any repercussion, I hit her up and asked if she wanted to hang out some time (I grew balls in those couple years without her in my life). 

She told me about one of our friends birthday party and that I could go to it and how she‚Äôll be there so I decided to go. At the party, since this was the first time I‚Äôve seen her in 2 years, seeing her had me frozen. I could only think about my feelings towards her and how they were one sided. 

I needed to get my mind off it so I started talking to one of the girls I met at the party. My close friend was actually trying to push us together and I didn‚Äôt know how to feel about that. The girl I started talking to got a lot of my attention that day and 2 weeks later, I asked her out. We started dating but then she changed. The problems that comes up with any relationship would be handled very poorly by her. She would be really disrespectful towards me and threaten to leave me if I don‚Äôt change the way I do things. I ended things a day before our 2 month anniversary. One thing I liked about going out with her though is that I got to see my close friend a lot more as long as she was there with me.

It‚Äôs been 3 weeks since all that has happened and I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can go with feeling this way. I don‚Äôt want to wait for my close friend to get out of her relationship because who knows when that‚Äôll happen and I don‚Äôt want waste my time but then I see her and forget everything I just said. But from what I‚Äôve seen, they fight a lot but seem to make up fast which could either be a good or bad thing. I also found out from my close friend that the boyfriend gets mad whenever she hangs out with me or anyone of her dude friends despite her knowing them longer than she‚Äôs known him. It‚Äôs clear as day how insecure the guy is. She can‚Äôt even hug her friends hello or goodbye or that would be another fight in the relationship. Obviously you can‚Äôt do certain things while in a relationship but she can‚Äôt do a lot of things I think she should be able to do. She basically has to give up seeing us as much as she wants to for the boyfriend to be happy. I honestly don‚Äôt think they should be together, even if a part of me is just saying that because I want to be with her. 

To try to get over her is way easier said than done as whenever we‚Äôre together, she is very touchy and sometimes our conversations suggest she‚Äôs flirting but I don‚Äôt know and I doubt it. She is loyal after all. And I can‚Äôt help but be reminded of her relationship every time I think about me being in one with her since I‚Äôve seen her and her boyfriend doing things couples do normally but it just messes with me. 

Something happened recently though. A couple days ago my friend walked in on my close friend and her boyfriend and as soon as he entered, the boyfriend got off from his knees. The next day, my close friend tells my friend that her boyfriend proposed to her and she showed him the ring. He‚Äôs not sure weather she was joking or not. 

I was speechless hearing this. We‚Äôre both 18 so getting married right now is crazy to me. They have been going out for maybe a year and a half but I don‚Äôt thinks that‚Äôs enough time to propose to someone. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do with my feelings. No one should have to hide their feelings but I‚Äôm afraid if I tell her I‚Äôm getting nothing in return and possibly losing her. That would be a nightmare to me because being her friend at the very least is good enough for me.

But I‚Äôve decided, after I got some really good advice from my last post (which is very similar to this but not the same), that I‚Äôm going to tell her how I feel no matter what happens after. i have the balls for it now. I just don‚Äôt know when I should do it and what exactly I should say to her. 

Here‚Äôs what I have planned so far: in the next couple times I see her, maybe 3 times from today, I will show her our first conversations which is funny and cringy. Then I‚Äôll ask her, based on how we texted, if she liked me back then or am I delusional. Whatever her response is, I‚Äôll just get lost in her eyes on purpose then ask if I can talk to her privately. There I‚Äôll tell her everything. What I think of her basically toxic relationship, some of the stuff I told ya about and whatever comes from my heart at the moment. Finally, I‚Äôll tell her ‚Äúi don‚Äôt remotely think you feel the same way I do towards me but that‚Äôs ok. I just really needed to get all that off my chest or else I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do‚Äù. I‚Äôll probably go home right after and lastly tell her ‚ÄúI understand if you don‚Äôt want to talk to me after today. Just know Ive treasured every second I got to spend with you. Take care.‚Äù 

The chances of us still being friends after saying all this is hazy (If she takes the news like an adult) but there is another way. I could simply take some time to my self and not see her so often and HOPE she notices or cares. If she does, I‚Äôd tell her everything right then and there and that I need the space away from her to think about everything. This approach might be safer but might have the same result as the first. And it‚Äôs all based on if she notices or cares that we haven‚Äôt talked.

996,cabzai,thenewthrowawayz,Struggling to deal with GFs mental health issues,"Throwaway because she knows about my actual account...

My gf (30F) and I (31M) have been together almost 4 years now and have generally been okay barring a few fights here and there. She started having mental health problems about a year or so in (anxiety and depression which came about all of a sudden) which were linked to abuse she suffered during her childhood. 

I tried my best to be supportive to her and help her as much as I can considering she lives quite far from me (I'm in LA and she's in SJ).

Originally she was not keen on medical treatment but we discussed at length and I managed to convince her to try meds to start with. She said she wanted to finish school before starting therapy because it was too difficult to discuss stuff whilst having classes on similar topics in school. I agreed, but now she's finished school, she says she doesn't think she'll ever get therapy because she feels fine. 

I don't think she's fine. She has terrible anxiety and is always on edge and irritated. It means we're fighting all the time now and our relationship is really strained. She wants to start planning our wedding now that shes out of school but I feel like even though I'm fully supportive of her, she should be taking responsibility for getting help with the mental health issues. I feel like a dick for thinking I should end it with her if she doesn't get help, but also feel powerless to make the situation better. What should I do?",2019-07-07 21:05:56,2,2,relationship_advice
997,cabykv,ArtfulMumbles,I [16M] got better AP exam scores than my girlfriend [15F] and I‚Äôm not sure how to comfort her.,"As the title says, my girlfriend did not get as high a grade as me on recently released exams. We both go to a competitive school, and I know these exams mean a lot to both of us. I know if I was in her spot I would feel the same way, and I‚Äôm not sure how I can comfort her to make her feel better about herself and about exams next year. I‚Äôve tried to tell her that these exam grades won‚Äôt make or break a college application, and I‚Äôve reinforced the fact that I love her to bits and an exam grade will not change that. I know that I would feel similarly, and I think she just needs time, but she means a lot to me and any advice on how to make her feel better would be appreciated.",2019-07-07 21:04:20,12,1,relationship_advice
