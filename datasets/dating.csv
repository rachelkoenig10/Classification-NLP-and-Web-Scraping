2,ca6n6n,C0nfusedGiirl,I hate when guys didn't respond and left me guessing. I'm not a mind reader! Why did they have to do that?,"That's getting annoyed and time-wasting!

I remember one guy from Tinder. He was the worst. We talked for several days. One day, his replies got slow and my instinct told me he probably got a ""better"" match. I still waited to see. We were about to have a date, but he asked me to push time back...TWO TIMES! He had to run errands, and then I noticed he deleted me from Snapchat. He finally texted me and messaged me on Tinder, ""I accidentally lost your text and forgot to save it. I have to pick up a relative from train at 4pm so we have to make it another time."" I was like ""okay no problem."" Then he unmatched me.

He led me on. Why can't he say no or he lost his interest? He shouldn't have wasted my time waiting!! Other guys weren't as bad as that guy. Most of them just let conversation die on purpose obviously and I can tell that. Some are afraid to say no so they just didn't reply. I wasn't sure if I should double text them.

I don't care what your experience with other women was like. I'm not one of them. I'll handle ""no"" well and move on. I hate when people makes me guessing! Sometimes, I just didn't know so I kept trying to figure out and solve a problem. Yes, that wasted my time! This guy shouldn't have lied, made up, and pushed the time back meanwhile he knew the date will not happen. Rude!

I always told guys I was no longer attracted in them or I changed my mind. I knew I had to be honest because I didn't want to lead them on. If a guy wouldn't take it as a no, tried to convince me, tried to message me as they hoped I changed my mind, I just ghosted them because I already said NO. They did leave me alone.

Why can't people just tell them they changed their mind or didn't want it anymore? Why did they have to be so afraid of hurting someone? Or should I have double texted some guys? I usually double text others including my male friends but I was told that guys don't like double texting because it makes me look desperate. Really? Now I'm thinking ""Screw that! I'm gonna treat them like I treat other people whether they like or not!"" I'm not gonna be a ""cool chick"" anymore!",2019-07-07 13:08:02,123,348,dating_advice
3,ca8zs0,thatviolabinch,"To the right person, you will perfectly make sense.","I guess this is kind of obvious, but I wanted to type it out for anybody that’s struggling with the idea like I am. 

I was in an abusive relationship for the past two years, lied to, cheated on, the usual in those types of situations. We’ve been broken up for about two months and I’ve spent a lot of this process wondering why it didn’t work. 

Wondering why I changed my personality and chameleoned to this person and it still wasn’t enough. Wondering how I could still be lied to when in my eyes I was completely dependent on them and never argued or spoke up for myself. 

It was unhealthy, but I thought what this person wanted was for me to be perfectly submissive to them.

I think about all the things I enjoy that they pretty much forced me to stop enjoying, the friends I had that they stopped me from seeing. The time for myself to enjoy myself that was stripped away from me. And I started to question what was wrong with me, and what was wrong with the things I enjoy. 

So I’m sitting here, doing an assignment for my next therapy session and watching my 600 pound life. And I think, these aren’t things my ex enjoyed. But they’re things that I enjoy. 

Some sort of epiphany happened where I thought, why stress about why I wasn’t perfect to one person when to the right person everything that I do will make sense. 


I guess I just wanted to vocalize, and I’m not really even sure if this belongs in this sub, but for anybody that needs it and as a tl;dr: 

don’t focus on changing yourself to be right for the wrong person. Be you, appreciate yourself truly and find out what you have to offer the world. To some, that won’t be what they’re looking for, but you and your individuality will be absolutely perfect for the right crowd, and you won’t have to worry about molding since you’ll already be a perfect fit.",2019-07-07 16:56:26,6,52,dating_advice
4,c9xmsw,Raziasaur,"If you have an unreciprocated crush on a friend and have to put the friendship on hiatus to fully get over it, do it!","I can’t tell you how many friendships have been fucked up because feelings got in the way of things.

When you’re rejected, don’t even bother trying again. Don’t stick around and continue to be flirty hoping your friend will change their mind. Suggest that you need to take time apart to get your shit together and move on. If it’s a true friend, they will understand. It sucks to be in an unrequited infatuation spell, but you’ll make yourself look like an idiot if you become persistent and ruin the friendship.

If you’re the rejector, don’t freak out about it if someone innocently asks you out. Don’t use the rejectee’s feelings to your advantage and keep giving them hope. Rejection can be a very delicate thing for some people. Have a talk with them about it and let them down easy in a way to make them feel like they’re still an awesome person.

5,ca7oll,Sharptheavenger28,I had to break it off. (26m) (23f),"Long story short, I met her through a mutual friend through a group I made on Facebook. It originally was a hook up. She messaged me, we worked out when, then she came over and we hooked up. It progressed into what basically was a relationship. She was 2 months fresh being seperated from her husband. Towards the end, I noticed some shady stuff, red flags (sitting his lap for 4th of July picture, not pulling the trigger to file for divorce, her constantly planting doubt in my head). Due to my overthinking and anxiety, it got to be too much for me mentally. Right before I deleted her off everything, she had posted a Snapchat story of her by the pool with friends, with a guy sitting next to her. 5 hours prior I sent a text that she never replied to. So that was it. I deleted everything. I feel like I did the right, no matter how bad it hurt to do it. I don't really ghost people but I feel like it was going to happen to me eventually. You make time for people you care about. You do what you can to avoid them having any doubt. That's not what she did. There's many other red flags I saw but for the sake of time, I left them out.

I’m genuinely looking for answers (from strangers on the internet yes I know). I was in a very bad relationship about 3 years ago, and it’s taken that long and a ton of therapy for me to be totally comfortable with myself again/regain my confidence. I’m 27, female, attractive by normal standards, I’m curvy/thick, tall, blonde and tattooed. I have a fun personality, lots of friends both female and platonic male friends. I have a job, a car, my own life and priorities. But when it comes to dating I can’t seem to figure it out. I’ll meet someone, go on a couple of dates and then poof! They vanish despite what I thought was a good connection. I’m not into one night stands or hooking up so it’s not a wham-bam thank ya ma’am situation. I’ll admit I’m being cautious about who I choose to go out with just based on my past trauma, but I’m really trying to put myself out there. I just don’t get it. Am I scary?

14,ca9xev,humanquit,This is not going to be a happy post. I (F21) am so effing angry with my SO (M21).,"He is in his last year of uni and I understand that can be very overwhelming but does that mean we shouldn't communicate? We're both very busy and we try not to overwhelm each other during the week because none of us have the time to talk for hours and we understand that. But during the weekend, I expect him to call him or let me know when he's available so I can, but lately that hasn't been happening. It's been 2-3 weeks now where I haven't heard his voice. I told him how it was upsetting me and he said ""we can talk at x time so call me, otherwise I will when I wake up."" Well, guess what? I called him but he was still asleep so he didn't pick up. Ok, fine, whatever. A little sad but it happens. So I waited for him to wake up to call me. Fell asleep waiting for him, but he didnt. I realize I sound a bit immature but I'm seriously upset. I've recently gone through something emotional (told him I needed his support) and i've been getting nada.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago, I told him that I realize we both will get busy as uni starts so we should discuss the optimal time to communicate. He said we didn't need to discuss anything since we both can call each other whenever we want... but obviously that hasn't been working **so what should I do?** If this helps, we've been in a relationship for 4+ years.

15,ca8r68,areddituser44,Great first date. Awful texter?,"So I (M30) has a great date a few days ago with this women (28). Hit it off really well, had a lot of laughs, flirting, kissed, held hands and she finished the night off by saying “I had a really great time!”.

Few days later the texting is slow...well she replies late, real late. Now she says she’s not much of a texter (said on first date)...but when I see that she’s received the text (WhatsApp read receipt) that night and she hasn’t replied to the next day in the afternoon - that goes beyond being a bad texter, right?

It’s 2019 and people are married to their phones but even ones who aren’t, surely having a supposed great date with a guy, but not texting back until later the next day is a sign she isn’t actually keen?

16,ca8ppu,pm_me_ur_fave_murder,I (25F) think i need to break up with my bf (32) but I’m anxious about it.,"I’ve been in this sub a LOT lately. Dating is hard lol. 
I’ve been dating this guy for juuust under 4 months. He’s great. He’s funny and makes me feel good. We laugh so much when we’re together. The honeymoon stage is still very much there, but it is beginning to fade. 

In the beginning of this i was smitten with this guy. I wanted to care for his “woe is me, I’m broken and undeserving of love” attitude and prove to him that he is deserving of someone caring for him. (I should have taken that as a flag maybe). I do still want to care for him, and show him what a good relationship could be. But i just don’t think it’s written in the stars for us. I was SO into him. It was annoying. He’s all i could talk about for weeks. He’s a gentleman. He’s handsome. He works out so he looks great. I showed him off constantly and never had anything bad to say about him. I romanticized the hell out of this guy to say the least. 

I initially started talking to this guy because he puts himself out there as an outdoorsy type of guy, always hiking and camping, trying to get out as often as possible. But since we’ve been together he’s rarely done any of that. He’d rather sit at home on his computer when the weathers nice than enjoy the day outside. He has a hard time getting himself motivated to do anything to help himself when it comes to his mental health. And our political views are drastically different (this is a new issue that’s recently been brought up). We just recently got into an argument about certain political things that are important to me, and the things he said were mind blowing. I don’t even look at him the same 

The last week for us has been rough. He slipped into a depressive episode and it was like pulling teeth trying to help him back out of it. He refused any help and refused to help himself. He finally pulled himself out of it on the 4th, and then we got into a fight (our first). So there’s been some tension and things are off. I’ve been feeling kind of “meh” about this relationship for a little over a week, before all this drama started and I’ve just chalked it up to my hormones since it’s that time of the month for me. But maybe it’s not. 

When we got into our fight, we both said that our different political views could cause issues and it worries us. But that was that. No more talk of the issue at all. 

I don’t know if i can sera future with him anymore. And I’d ideally tell him this in person, as soon as possible. But i have my child until next weekend so we won’t see each other until then. Would it be shitty of me to tell him “i don’t think this is going to work out” over a text message? He knows something is up, there’s been crazy tension between us for the last few days. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m sad about this, and i don’t want to hurt him, but i don’t think i can be in a relationship with someone who has the views he does.",2019-07-07 16:31:38,2,4,dating_advice
17,ca7v4c,dayemm,Dating multiple people?,"I’m the type of person who prefers to get to know one person at a time. I find someone on a dating app that I have a good conversation with and when I get their number to chat elsewhere, I stop using it to find anyone else.

My friends have said that I should stay on the app and not ‘put all my eggs in one basket’ as such. But the thought of trying to remember what I’ve spoken about to guy A and what I’ve spoken about to guy B just seems more stress than it’s worth 😅

18,ca7r6n,Tsmooth323,"Im so heartbroken, lost and confused","I'm a 33 yr old man and my ex girlfriend (34yrs old) broke up with me out of the blue. We were together for 7 months. Last week, she hugged me, looked me in my eyes, kissed me and said she loved me. Then 3 hours later I get this text ""You're an amazing man, but you're not the one for me. I'm sorry to hurt you, but I'm not going to continue a relationship that I don't see as my forever, I'm sorry I don't feel that way with you. I didn't feel what I needed to feel when I met you. "" 

I told her in the begining to take it slow because she'd only been separated from her ex husband for 8 months and the divorce was just finalized less than 2 months ago, but she pursued the relationship. She said she loved me first.   

A few months ago, I commented on a female co-worker's picture, but it wasn't inappropriate. I just asked her was it busy tonight because I thought about picking up a shift. Then my ex said ""You're just like my ex husband."" Then she blocked me on Facebook Messenger and unfriended me. Then she apologized, added me back and unblocked me. But this time after she left me, I told her to block and unfriended me because I can't do it to her because I love her so much, but she didn't. 

TL;DR Why would she hug me, kiss me, look me in my eyes and say she loved me, then break up with me via Facebook Messenger 3 hours later?

I’ve (23/M) been with my girlfriend (22/F) for 5 months now. She’s amazing and I really do love her, even though she has a rough past with her family and other encounters. She has been very honest and open with me and it’s only brought us closer. She is so strong and I respect her so much.
I am pretty good looking myself, enough to get her attention. She is very good looking and has a lot of men that give her attention, but she’s always honest with me and I know she would never cheat on me. My last girlfriend of over a year cheated on me, and she was the only girl I had been with before my current girlfriend.
I told my gf very early that I had been cheated on and later that she was the second person I had been with. We instantly connected and had slept together one of the first few times we hung out, so I know it took her by surprise considering I did make a move on her so quickly. Whenever I would talk about girls I’ve been with before, she’d just say silent. 
I finally explicitly asked her how many guys she had been with. She told me 15 and looked really ashamed about it.
My intent was not to make her feel bad about it, I know she’s good looking and had a bad relationship as her first. I don’t think any different about her as a person but it has been making me question our relationship. Should it matter who she was with before me? She argued that she didn’t want to get into a long term relationship and get bored and want to experience other people so she now has that experience.

The problem is that she's usually with her friends who are a really tight nit group and they don't really talk to anyone else. The group is pretty large (7-10 people), so I find it pretty intimidating to introduce myself to the whole group and they don't seem eager to make new friends. At this point in the semester, it'd be pretty odd to try to join in. 

This one time when we were both alone waiting for class, she came up to me and we had a pretty good conversation but it was cut short when her friends came. Other than that, I haven't really talked to her much because she's always with her group.

It's been a year since we met. Initially while getting to know her, we sort of hit it off since we were connecting on different things and topics and I (22 M) really felt something for her. Things go on, we keep going out with a group of friends, she was really a good person at heart. She used to subtly indicate at a lot of times that I was a really good friend to her. After a while I sort of couldn't take it anymore, I confessed my feelings for her and she was actually speechless at that moment, I let her know that I'll want to stay distant from her try to forget her. Later over a week or two, She tried to convince me twice or thrice to talk back to her. But I was stern that I wanted to forget her, as my feelings had intensified over a couple of months. 8 months later, she tries to convince me again and I sort of give in to her explanation. She wants to keep talking to me and so on but she mentions that she has crushes but never felt like pursuing a guy in her life, so she'll never be sure if she would like me in the same way. The main cause of my confusion is that, I always feel that she likes me whenever we interact, I've seen no girl sharing so many things or being so playful with me while just being friends, it's probable that I'm very naive. Moreover, this girl has another female friend, whom I used to hang out with a lot. We were just friends. But this girl has indicated at different times about the female friend having a boyfriend and how I should stay away, subtly always. After this whole episode that lasted over 8 months that I don't talk to her, avoid her, I know it's really selfish but that was for my own emotional stability, I fell head over heels in love just about in 2-3 months. We both went out recently and I really felt that she liked me, It was just the both of us but quite a beautiful day for me which I'll probably remember all my life. We will probably not be seeing each other after a few months, she has a traveling job and I'll probably leave mine to join the armed forces. She knows about this and keeps asking when we would meet again in life. I keep telling her that I'll always find time for her, just a cheesy thing I say. Please know that we live in India and I'm 22 and I have no relationship experience, probably as I was never talking to girls invested in reading and my guy friends always. Sorry for the long post!

We got together for lunch recently, and it went well. We had a pretty good time. However, she’s talking to somebody else. After I told her how I felt, she told me that she didn’t want to be disrespectful to him. It was something new and she had no worries with him, so she’s just going with the flow, but she still doesn’t even know if she wants to date him. She hasn’t even thought about that. She was honest and that’s all I could ask for. She cared enough to not lead me on and to be blunt with me. We had a great conversation about our feelings, but this is where it got complicated. She said she doesn’t want me to necessarily give up hope. She’s not ready right now, but she could see us being together once she got 100% comfortable again. We don’t know what’s going to happen in the future. She’s leaving the state soon, and it just so happens to be where I had already been planning on moving to after college. One part of me wants to just have fun for the time being and wait until things fall into place one to two years from now, and the other part of me is telling me to move on.

27,caaa87,away13355,the girl(21F) keep on apearing in my(21M),"I'm not sure where to start so I will just start from the very start. Me and this girl ended up in the same class in high school. We live in a rather small town (5000 people). the school program I wanted to attend was not in our town so I attended high school in the neighboring town, the class was 50/50 between people from our town and the neighboring town. the girl was from the neighboring town so I had not known her at all until 1 day of school.

&amp;#x200B;

throughout my academic years, I have been very lucky. both my parent are highly intelligent people that thought us the love of knowledge, and paired with an unusually good memorie that all the kids in the family have school was not hard, my father was also an athlete in his younger years. I had really good grades, not the best but I never did homework as I did not see the necessity for it. I was always the kid in class everyone would ask for help before test and group projects. this might seem like a little self jerk of but I say this as this is somewhat important in this story.

&amp;#x200B;

So school starts and the first couple of weeks people get to know each other, I make new friends, etc the usual start of high school stuff. I'm quite easy to talk to and I get friendly with the entire class, we had a good group, not much bullying etc. the girl was also one of them, got to know her name and son general stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

as the weeks went by and the test started the usual helping people starts. in the beging, it was only people that I knew from before but as time went on more and more people started to catch on. I never had a problem with it as it was never more than 10-15min of help that I needed doing, it was also a way for me to get to know the people on a more personal note. I have many friends today from conversations that started form me helping in a way.

&amp;#x200B;

The girl was one of them. she was a smart girl but math was really not her thing, she could write you deep analysis on a poem but algebra made her brain dead. she was not special at that time as there where several girls in my class that I would help during breaks and over skype after school. I got to know her more and more and we would sometimes chat, but we were not friends. the conversations were only about school most times and we never hung out after school.

&amp;#x200B;

this continued the first year and to the end of the second year of high school. at the end of the second year I couth feelings for her. we where on a school trip and as we had talked a lot about math and cats over the 2 years we hit it off. I realized how cool of a chick she was. but it turned out she was in a relationship. I was crushed but as a normal teen I just hid my emotions and went on with life.

&amp;#x200B;

high school ends and I move away to uni pursuing my degree. at this point I have 0 contacts with the girl and about 10 months go by. out of the blue get a long message from the girl thanking me for all the times I helped her and more, I still have the message to this day. I reply and we start talking a bit about how life's been. at this point, it is obvious that she is at a low point. I tell her I'm coming home the following weeks for a holiday and invite her to a cup of coffee. she accepts and we have good contact the following weeks until we meat up. I will not lie I enjoyed talking to her a lot during the coffee and I could feel some of the emotions coming back. during the coffee, we talk about life after high school and much more.

&amp;#x200B;

the meeting ended up lasting 6h or so, we talked about life, hobbies, she wanted to know about college life as she had taken a year off saving some money. she also started talking about the past relationship she broke off not long before messaging me. I respectfully told her that I don't have an interest in that and she understood.

I went back to college and the conversations slowed down more and more. I won't lie I liked the girl a lot and I was really hurt in high school so I was a bit hesitant to open myself up. my life went on but the girl had made an imprint in my mind again.

&amp;#x200B;

the following 2 years we had coffee 2-3. initiated every time by her. she would start messaging me 2 weeks before major holidays and see if I was coming home or not. at one meeting she was sobbing in front of me and asking for life advice. she has mad a couple of og mistakes and in her life and it looks like she comes to me when she is down low.

&amp;#x200B;

now im 1 year away from getting my degree and i was looking for a summer job without much luck. the girl messaged me again we talked and I mentioned the summer job. within days her boss was called me offering me a job. I was told that the girl had given a recommendation so she invited me to an interview and I got the job. when I asked her why she did it she told me she wanted to spend more time with me and she wanted to see how I would do among her colleges.

&amp;#x200B;

long story but here is my question. what does she want? I can admit that I have not made a real attempt as I don't want those feelings to come and hurt me again. I really like the company and I know she likes mine too. a couple of days ago she said in a joking way ""would it not be fun if the two of us just went somewhere and started a business together"" in a joking way I said that could be fun. her reaction was surprised but she seemed a bit serious.

&amp;#x200B;

I have left out a lot of details in this post as I would need pages to write all we talked about. what does she want?",2019-07-07 18:43:30,1,2,dating_advice
28,caa9xq,sadboi_1999,Don't start off in the dating world with casual hook ups.,"So I know people have differing opinions on the subject but for me at least (an friendless introvert, who never had a relationship before) I found that causal hook ups are not the way of building your self esteem and confidence when you start off in the dating world.

For reasons I'd like to not get into I lost my virginity to a girl on tinder. She was attractive but not what I was looking for. The moment after was bitter sweet, I knew I accomplished something but I wasn't happy about it. I remember looking at the night sky as I was leaving her place at 3am, there was full moon too. The moment felt like something was lifted from my shoulders but I had no clue what.

Then I kept on hooking up, more and more. The first couple times I sobbed afterwards on the drive home.   Looking in mirror of a filthy gas station restroom was a reminder I was trying to become something I wasn't. It was heart breaking to me, seeing how far I've fallen from a sweet guy to some selfish asshole. I couldn't bear it. I fallen into some self destructive trance and slept with more partners.

I had gotten myself in alot of situations, from being the person a fiance used to cheat on her lover with to almost getting incurable STDs. I broke alot of hearts along the way, including mine.

After I think number 17, I snapped. I was unhappy that I wasn't unhappy if that makes sense. I was numb and incapable of being in love with someone. That honestly scares me. Being 20 and having such a high body count within the matter of months. Believe it or not it's generally looked down upon by women. The facial expressions I get when I'm asked about my count and I reply, breaks me a little every time.

So now I realised I'm nothing more than the loser I was before I had sex. I didn't gain anything, I'm still the shy boy who couldn't even talk to a girl irl without the use of an app. 

What should you do instead? Well for starters don't do what I did, It hasn't been proven to work yet but for me at least I'm going to try and work on my people skills and make friends. Start slow because I think time is what's going to be the biggest help here. 

Listen to my advice and you should save yourself the added stress of getting almost getting someone knocked up, getting tested for STDs, and paying an absurd amount for a tiny pill. 

If you want to add or argue anything feel free. Again this is just my take away from my own experience.",2019-07-07 18:42:48,1,2,dating_advice
29,caa5gl,burube,Is it normal you only realize you love the person when there’s distance between you?,"I dated a guy for three months before he went back to his home country. During the time he was here, I did enjoy spending time with him and really like him a lot, but when we weren’t hanging out, I didn’t really miss him that much. I’d look forward the next time I see him but there’s no really strong urge to be around him 24/7.

Now it’s been a month since he was back to his country. We’re no longer dating but we’re still texting each other everyday. Maybe text even more than before. I started to think about him day to day, wonder what he’s doing, how his day is. there’s time I even tear up because I miss him too much, he basically occupies my mind every second. 

I thought the feeling would just fade over time, but it didn’t. I think we both didn’t. He told me he dreamed about me last night, it makes me smile, knowing that I might be on his mind too. I know I’m kind of rambling right now. It just sucks we are being apart.",2019-07-07 18:32:35,1,2,dating_advice
30,ca8jh5,teddysready1,How do you navigate non-exclusive relationships (FWB) without getting jealous?,"I've been in a casual relationship (non-exclusive, FWB..call it what you will) for around 2 years with a friend of 10+ years. It was rocky to start, jealousy on my part when I knew he was dating others, not being on the same page, some dishonesty on his part. We took a break from each other and recently reconnected and have started hooking up and hanging out again and it's good this time around. Whatever feelings I had for him have dissipated... I guess I realized we'd never actually work as a couple. He has some issues from past relationships and we don't have the same goals, but we do have a shit ton in common and good sexual chemistry.. so it just works. For now.

We recently went for drinks where we had a good talk about what works and what doesn't in terms of when it's time to call it quits. And also why we never pursued things further. We agree we both care about each other, but he bluntly said that ""it's just not there..something is missing. I WANT it to be there. I guess there's just not that SPARK I want to find with someone.. I WANT it to be you. Maybe it's me, maybe I'm scared or looking for too much. You make me wonder, because you're so empathetic and make me feels so cared for... but, my heart doesn't beat out of my chest for you...""

Ok, ouch. But he was honest. I agreed that something does seem to be missing. He seems to have too much issues with his past, there are little things he has lied about that make me not trust certain things, and I don't know.. yeah, something is missing.

We have fun with each other, we have established that.  We go out to eat, we go out for drinks, we have each other over to hang out and watch sports and catch up. We text maybe once or twice a week about whatever. We have the FRIENDS part down for the most part, in the FRIENDS with benefits. And the sex is good.  

I guess my question is, how do I just enjoy it for what it is and not care if he's going on dates, or talking to other people, or sleeping with other people? Like I said, there's not those feelings of ""I want to be with you"", but I do care for him and the sharing thing just bothers me even though it shouldn't... if we're not exclusive. Those that do these casual relationships, how do you keep yourself in check and not care what he's doing when he's not with you?",2019-07-07 16:15:43,2,3,dating_advice
31,ca6t3k,Chandlerbingsing,I don’t no what to do next,"I’m so completely clueless! Our families are friends and we see each other at family get togethers. For 2 years she was in to me it was so obvious. So I asked her out knowing she would say yes. We dated a few times but I could tell she wasn’t bothered about it. We didn’t do anything neither apart from kiss, so it wasn’t like she wanted a casual thing. She told me she likes me but doesn’t want a relationship as her mind is not in the right place, then because she’s away at university a lot she said. I found out after from her mom that she is hurting from her past relationship and it was too soon. I’d kept hearing from people she was really in to me so it came as a bit of a shock. 

A week later I text her saying I liked her but we should just be friends. To which she said she enjoys being friends with me. It was mostly because I didn’t want it to be awkward at family get togethers. I nearly didn’t ask her out for this very reason, our parents are probably best friends so I didn’t want it to feel awkward. But to be honest I don’t want to be just friends, I just didn’t no how else to handle it. She practically said she doesn’t want anything while she is at university which is another 2 years. So imagine how awkward it would of been if I said nothing. Did I friendzone myself?

So yesterday was the first time I saw her since we dated (to which was 3 months ago). It felt so flat like she wasn’t bothered to even speak to me. She’s shy and has got anxiety, and I kept catching her looking at me. We hardly talked at first it was like she didn’t want to. But then we did at the end of the night. I ended up telling her I dated somebody and it didn’t work out (is that a bad thing to tell her that)!? Then she went on about this creepy guy who won’t stop texting her. Then we just talked about random stuff. My mom said to me there seemed to be more between us than just friends? I didn’t get that feeling? But I’m really clueless. I really don’t no what to do. I have no idea how she feels. I don’t even want to ask her. I’m not scared of rejection, I’m scared of breaking up the family get togethers and never seeing her again. 

Like I don’t no what she wants, she said she liked me and I do believe that. But last night she just seemed so disinterested in anything. Yet my mom thinks she was interested? Confused!",2019-07-07 13:26:36,9,4,dating_advice

34,ca9zb1,throwaway487921,"(18M, 18F) Is telling her how I feel a good idea?","So my longtime friend turned crush and I are going through a bit of a rough patch and I think it’s because she knows I’m into her. I talked to her about this and she said that things have become awkward and I’m acting differently. 

I told her that making things awkward is the last thing I want. And the only different thing we did was hang out alone and that wasn’t even called a date by either of us. 

But since then I’ve just been a normal friend to her. And we’ve always had a good friendship, not to mention she did have fun hanging out with me. 

She said something good about us being friends and how she’s probably overthinking this, so all of this is leading to two things: either she likes me back and is wondering why I’m not doing anything more, or she doesn’t like me back and is pushing me away. 

The second thing doesn’t explain why she still talks to me and maybe some small signs of her liking me, but on the other hand there are some signs that she isn’t into me. 

I was going to ask her out this week but now I don’t know what to do. If she kinda knows how I feel, then should I just tell her? Should I ask her out on a date? Or should I just not do anything?

The things he said didn’t feel like empty general compliments because he described me the way I hope to be. He said I was passionate, dedicated, smart, honest, interesting. These are qualities that I strive to be as a nursing student. Him saying these things within hours of meeting made me feel like I am becoming the person I strive to be. It made me feel seen. I don’t think I’ve ever felt so validated in my life lol. 

I haven’t quite made up my mind yet on if I like him. For now I just really like feeling seen. I appreciate his perseverance, his passion for optometry, his sense of humor, his quirks, and his looks (lol).

The problem is that he’s moving to Chicago in a month for optometry school. I currently live in California. He’ll be back for breaks and next summer. I’ll finish nursing school in about a year and half and honestly Chicago sounds like a fun place to live...

The second date didnt go as well because he was a lot more guarded. I think he was doing it subconsciously, and I totally understand that. Ain’t nobody tryna get into a long distance relationship after a month, especially when we’re both going to be extremely busy with school. I suggested just calling it before getting invested. He said it was the logical thing to do. I said I was down to be illogical. He said he didn’t want to hurt me (pretty sure that’s guy language for “I’m scared”). He mentioned hanging out when he’s in town, but I didn’t understand the point. 

It’s been a few days and I still can’t shake this guy. Part of me is afraid no one will ever see me like he did. I hope that’s an irrational fear, but I don’t think my exes that loved me thought of me like that. Or maybe they did and I was too insecure to see it. 

Another part feels like us meeting was destiny. We went to the same college, with the same major, and we were the same year. We probably had classes together but we never met. I also remember being invited to his sports team parties, but I never ended up going. And now we’re meeting two years later in a town 100 miles away from where we went to school. It feels like either a huge coincidence or that the universe has trying to get us to meet for 6 years.

I‘m so desperate right now. I met this boy and everything was just perfect we had a great time together, almost since 3 months. Now things got serious and we talked about what‘s next. I think he is pretty much faster than i because i think that i have to get to know him better (but this doesn‘t matter anymore)...so he told me that he likes me really much but he‘s not kinda in love. And i‘m totally ok with this because how could anyone be in love with seeing each other every 2 weeks lol...i don‘t think that this is possible, there can‘t be a connection build up and with every meeting you start emotionally over and over again. Well this is my point of view. But i think he believes maybe in love at first sight and so he told me that he don‘t wanna do this anymore because he has no strong feelings til now and he doesn‘t wanna fool anyone and wait if there will be more feelings because in the end maybe someone is gonna hurt (i‘m hurt rn but nevermind). I don‘t believe in love at first sight and think that to build up stronger feelings just need time. I can‘t trust anyone so easy and can‘t open up pretty good so i have to create a kinda mutual trust before i can totally fall into it. And obviously he sees this things different. I didn‘t wanted to tell him all of this and just said oh well, i understand, it‘s okay. It hurts that he said he likes me pretty much and THIS IS IT...i can‘t cope with this. 

But now my real problem: i don‘t know how to get over it because i‘m so convinced that this could have been fucking perfect. I‘m stuck and can‘t let it go fuck. Does anyone (if anyone is reading this long nonsene bullshit) have an advice to get over this? He‘s my first dating experience so i really don‘t know what to do now and this hurts.

I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/bkmhip/am_i_reading_bad_signs_or_over_reacting/) 2 months ago, after 4 weeks of dating M\[20\] (let's call him Ben) 

One of the comments was brutally honest in saying ""You need to talk to him, rather than strangers on the internet""

and I did just that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite meeting as an accidental one night stand, I was never under the impression that Ben was a fuckboy or messed girls around. I could tell straight away that he was a genuinely kind and caring person, who went above and beyond for others. But as I got to know him more, I found out that actually he was a fuckboy. Potentially the worst kind of fuckboy, because he was never actually a dick to girls - he just used them for sex. 

After writing the initial post on reddit, I realized that I was dating a fuckboy, and he didn't want a relationship. 

But I talked to him, we communicated and told each other how we felt. 

I guess it was the typical old habits die hard situation - he had spent an entire year sleeping around, seeing multiple girls at once and having no loyalties to anyone - therefore I was easily just ""another girl"".

I told him how I felt, and he told me how he felt. 

He stopped fucking around, he started to take things more seriously and put the effort in. 

I won't sugar coat it, it was a LOT of pain and very difficult initially. We had both fallen in love, yet were both scared of love. The amount of emotional pain we both went through was unbearable, there was a lot of crying and a lot of arguing, and more than one instance where I just wanted to give up completely.

But when two people are meant to be together, then they will be together. 

He finally made it official last month. He has had two ex girlfriends before me, and he's said that I've made him realise just how horrible those two girls were to him. His friends, family and co-workers all love me, and everyone in our lives can see how happy we make each other 

He has changed so much about himself to be with me - all positive changes, but these changes would never have happened if I'd have not been open with him about how I feel. 

It's hard to coherently express how things have worked out so well. 

We had to get over so much difficult stuff, and there are still the odd moments where I feel upset and scared and doubt things, but we talk about it straight away. I tell him exactly how I am feeling, and he listens. 

I never thought id wake up every morning next to the most beautiful person I've ever met. I never knew what it was like to feel safe and loved and welcome. I never knew what it felt like to just fall into someone's arms and know that everything is going to be okay. I never ever thought id fall in love, and i never thought id find someone who is my exact description of perfect. but I did, and I am so so happy, its something that can happen for anyone, you've just got to be open and expressive with your emotions.",2019-07-07 18:48:31,1,2,dating_advice
49,caa7j8,woahwoahwoah111,Small city woes.,"Meeting people in their 20's in my city is really hard, and I don't know what to do at this point. Does anyone have a similar experience of living in a small city and struggling to find people?

I live in a small, poor city. My demographic (20's) is even smaller and poorer. It's a college town, yet most events are filled with people who are 45+. The campus life is notoriously empty (I suspect because everyone has 1-2 jobs on top of studies, and because it's a commuter school). I found the ONE Meetup group for people in their 20's and 30's, and everyone I've met is married. The dating apps are similarly a ghost town. I've seen the same dozen people on the 4 dating apps I've used.

I'm dying to meet people my age. I've worked so hard to meet people in the last year, fighting my social anxiety to go from hermit to going out every weekend to bars, meetups, hikes, events for hobbies I like. No luck. 
 
It's really frustrating. All the standard advice for meeting people just doesn't seem to work. It's not even THAT small a city: half a million people live here. I don't know why it's so hard to meet people that I connect with. What do you even do in this situation? I wish I could just move to a more youthful city, but I have 4 years of graduate school to finish.",2019-07-07 18:37:16,2,1,dating_advice

51,caa48k,Quick_Bath,Why do some people not prioritize relationships?,"For example someone I know wants a relationship, but he doesn't make any effort to talk to women he's dating or seeing them regularly and thus they don't stick around. 

Last woman he dated asked him what he wanted and he genuinely said he'd take anything, so while she was hoping he'd say a relationship he basically told her he'd be okay with just FWB and thus not really show her he wanted a relationship or put effort into building a relationship. 

Talking to him I found out that the longest relationship he's had was only 15 months and he counts the last person he was dating (2 months) as a relationship. He's 35. That's not normal.

I know there's more to life than dating, I just struggle to understand people who don't want real relationships or who say they want a relationship but are so apathetic towards dating.",2019-07-07 18:29:41,6,0,dating_advice

I F(25) do want to be with her what do I do?,"We’ve been going out for a while and I really really like her and she likes me too. We talk on the phone, we go out on dates, we have sex, we kiss, we basically do everything you would in a relationship. But she told me she’s not the relationship type, I told her I am. And for a while I decided to stop seeing her because if she doesn’t want to be with me then it’s not meant to be. But I came back to her because I like her and thought that I could do this friends with benefits thing as long as I don’t hear from her other flames or whatever. 

Then i started talking to other girls and found this gorgeous girl who’s exactly my type (at least physically, I’m just getting to know her)but I just don’t feel like going out with her I want to be with the first girl. I don’t want to date anyone else :( 

I told her this and she told me she’s not going out with anyone else, that she really likes me but she stands with what she said of not being in a relationship and that she feels guilty that she’s wasting my time. And now that I really think about it I am wasting my time and energy to a dead end but I feel Like she likes me as I like her, and maybe she’s just afraid of a relationship?  She told me she wouldn’t like me going out with someone else but she would understand.  So that tells me she wants exclusivity ? 

Should I just cut everything we’ve build cold turkey and go out with gorgeous girl who I don’t even know if I’ll like? 

Should I just stay in limbo until she wants a relationship? 

Should I go out with both of them and then decide?

TL;DR: 

Going out and falling for a girl who’s made it clear she doesn’t want a formal relationship but she’s not going out with anyone else and really likes me too and would get jealous if I went out with someone else.

Found another girl but I’m not feeling it because i want to be with the first girl.

53,caa19f,INeedAdivce3,When do you differentiate between going on dates and dating?,"Obligatory sorry for the format, I’m on mobile. 

I’ll try and keep it short as possible. tldr at bottom. 

I [20M] have been friends with this girl [21F] for a little over a year now. Last summer we would frequently get coffee together after summer classes. I don’t think either of of thought of it as anything more than friends getting coffee. But the end of the summer I started to develop feeling for her, but we both were going to college 3 hours away and I didn’t think it would be the best move to pursue that relationship. 

During the school year, we didn’t talk much at all. I think I saw her once when our breaks overlapped, but again there was nothing romantic about this encounter. 

This summer she reached out to me and now we volunteer at the same place and our friendship has been great. I invited her to a concert that I had an extra ticket to and we had a great time. We were flirty and talked a lot, but we were both under the influence. Fast forward a week later and she asked me to get ice cream late at night. We spent about 2 hours talking and had a good time. It was never blatantly said that it was a date, but I think both of us realize that it is. 

A few days ago I specifically asked her on a date to play mini golf and get dinner which she said yes to. This date is happening on Tuesday. 

We have already planned another date after this upcoming one on Tuesday. Is it okay to assume that we are dating or does there need to be some sort of conversation? If there does need to be a conversation, how do I bring it up?

tl;dr: I’ve been in a few dates with a girl and don’t know if we’re dating. How do I bring up this conversation.",2019-07-07 18:22:54,1,1,dating_advice
54,ca9yvs,rafaelvicuna2,"Advice to people who have the complaint ""I attract women I don't find attractive but the women I like don't like me back""","This applies mostly to the guys who get approached by women they find unattractive or women who are below their standards, and I think you might like my answer depending on how you take or interpret it.

Only unattractive women made it CLEAR they are into you. That has nothing to do with who is actually attracted to you.

Attractive women don't need to reveal their interest much because a lot of men already come and approach them. Only the demographics of women who are not approached by men themselves will declare their intent or interest. That demographic is usually fat or unattractive women.  I'm going to go on a limb here and say that you probably act differently around someone you find attractive compared to someone you find unattractive.

If they are showing interest in you, then other women including attractive ones are probably also interested in you. Unattractive women and attractive women are both women, they have the same brains, and only the exterior is different. Ugly women aren't attracted to different traits that physically attractive women aren't also attracted to. Being physically unattractive doesn't make them different in the head, they're still attracted to attractive guys regardless.

I don't usually like giving meme advice, but this is the first time that it applies. In this case you just have to put yourself out there.",2019-07-07 18:17:17,4,0,dating_advice
55,ca9yjc,Blade0896,Why does this always happen?,"So, I am a 22 years old guy, having a good and fullfilling job and living in my own apartment. Concerning looks I'd consider myself as a 8/10.
In my entire life I only had one real relationship which lasted like 3 months. I dated a lot of girls (all of them were met online, since I have been really ugly, until my puberty helped me out and I often got roasted for that before, so self confidence is still really low).
Everytime after one date which went at least decent, I immedeately imagine having a relationship with that girl and start to get really clingy and/or come off too strong, which most of the time leads to them not wanting to meet me again after 3-4 dates. This always leaves me depressed for like 2-4 weeks.
I never understood why I suddenly had so much affection. With the affection comes the big fear of being rejected again, which leads again to me being clingy and weird.

56,ca9xww,Revhalin,"(Long Post, but I really need help) (21M) with massive crush on best friend (20M).","So... what do I do when I have a hardcore crush on someone, but their life situation and current stance on dating would just make expressing my feelings unfair/disrespectful to them? I've caught feelings for my best friend in a pretty big way and it's probably the most a crush has ever affected me. I've waited to tell him for almost a year (11 months to be exact) and I've already missed one big opportunity to do so because of my stupidity...

As I said, he's my best friend and I've known him for 10 years now. He and I for the most part, were the only single dudes in our friend group for quite a while and that changed for him not too long ago. He recently started delving into the world of dating again and has only had one semi-serious relationship with a past relationship that wasn't very serious. He happens to be gay and I'm bisexual, leaning more towards girls. He's the first major crush I've had on a guy which is already a little weird for me. I've had a few small gay crushes here and there throughout high-school, but never one this serious. He and I have always been closer with each other than our other friends, but I've never thought about him in a romantic way until sometime around my birthday of last year (July 31st) which is when he and I ***really*** started to bond with each other. And these feelings only grew stronger throughout the rest of 2018. After spending a week with him and our other friends on a New Year's vacation: I kinda fell for him. Now I get butterflies in my stomach whenever I talk to him, game with him or even just hear his voice. I initially thought it was just infatuation and that my feelings weren't real, but after 11 months of this: I'm quite sure it is real. 2019 has been rough on me for a few reasons and he is no exception. Mainly because, he makes me feel so happy, accepted and appreciated, but I'm pretty sure he doesn't quite feel the same way I do. On one hand: he's the most loving and affectionate person I've ever met. He's super respectful, smarter than he thinks he is, funny/witty as hell... *admittedly kinda hot* and just an absolute sweetheart. I admire and care for him so much... But on the other hand, I don't know if a relationship between us (if there is indeed a chance) would even work. I'll explain why a bit later.

He got a boyfriend late December and dated him until mid June. They went through a really rough break up and it was the first time in 10 years of knowing him, that I've EVER heard my friend cry. It killed me to hear him like that, I wanted to cry with him... But considering the situation: I didn't think it'd be very appropriate, so I choked it down as best I could until he left our call to go to sleep. I've done my best to be there for him in this time of need and it seems as though I've done a good job. He's working towards moving on and is focusing on himself and the rest of us again. However, he clearly doesn't wanna date anyone anytime soon. Which makes total sense. Though, that does kinda hurt me a bit because I have to wait a lot longer to confess, out of respect for how he feels. Which just makes confessing so much harder. And I wasn't going to tell him right now anyway, because that just would've been stupid of me to pour out my feelings to him so soon after his breakup.

Now, there's a few other things keeping me from confessing to him and being hopeful that a relationship could work. It's not just that he isn't looking for a relationship right now.

1. I'm not his type. He's made it very well known to me the kind of guys he's into, and I don't fit that description ***at all***. Couldn't be farther from it, in my opinion. I'm basically a child compared to the type of guy he likes. Granted, he's not exactly the type of guy I'd go for either... but I still think he's very attractive.
2. We're kinda... long distance at the moment. He lives in Florida and I live in South Carolina. We met online when we were younger and have only met up once in person. That New Year's Vacation that I mentioned being the first and only time. The two of us along with our friends are planning to have more meetups in the coming months though. He was told that he and his family are gonna be moving to North Carolina (not too far from where I live actually), due to his dad's new job, but he doesn't know when. He's made it very clear that he doesn't want a long distance relationship, which I totally understand. He and I both were there for a friend going through a pretty serious LDR and it sucked. I wouldn't wanna put someone through that, and I'm sure he wouldn't either.
3. He and I are best friends and I'm scared that confessing my feelings is gonna fuck that up. The thing I'm the most worried about isn't necessarily the rejection, because I've gone through that with other crushes already. It's more so getting to that point of confession, along with said confession making things awkward to the point where we can no longer be friends. The fact that we're long distance, along with him not looking for a relationship has almost completely discouraged me from telling him how I feel. I've talked with my other friends in our group about this and expressed my concern of him abandoning me. All three of them said that it would be totally uncharacteristic of him to just drop me completely and never talk to me again. Which I agree with, but even still: it's just an irrational fear I guess. The last crush I had before him ended in that very same way. I knew this girl way longer than I've known him, crushed on her for around a year, finally worked up the balls and confessed, she rejected me and dropped me. I don't want him to drop me too, it'd kill me inside if he did. I can accept the rejection, but the potential abandonment by the best friend I've ever had would just destroy me. I know it sounds like I have no faith in him... But that's not the case at all! I'm just... scared. Because it's already happened to me before with someone else...

Ultimately, there's three things I'm looking for with this situation.

1. Obviously I wanna be with him. I wouldn't be making such a big deal out of this if I didn't.
2. If/when I get rejected, I still really want us to go on being friends. Like I said earlier, our other friends told me that it'd be pretty uncharacteristic for him to abandon me if I confessed. And they're confident that after some time away from each other following the possible rejection, he and I can go on being best friends. He's always tried as hard as he could to salvage non-romantic relationships that went wrong and it's always worked and it was like nothing ever happened. I've witnessed it myself. So that makes me feel a bit better, but that doubt will always be in the back of my mind. I can't help it.
3. I just want him to happy. And even though I'd really like to try and be the one that makes him feel happy and special, appreciated and cared for, I think I can accept it if he doesn't want that in a romantic way from ***me***. If he thinks he'd be happier that we weren't dating, then that's okay with me.

I dunno y'all, I'm so conflicted on what I should do here... I've definitely come to the conclusion that ***if*** I do end up telling him, it won't be for quite a while from now. But at the same time, for the sake of our friendship and out of respect for him: I dunno if I should tell him at all...

I  am also pretty busy but if it is for one person I can always make space. And I would like someone who speaks english ( but where I live they don't really but hey... if my ex was bilingual and I am too.. I am sure there are other people as well.) 


So I was thinking dating apps? Thing is right now I am abroad... so I can't change my location unless I pay. Is it worth it ? Like Tinder app for eg or are people on tinder genuinely just looking for ons and fwb? I am ready to settle... and not move country so I would like someone in the area. I think attraction is important though. I feel like it is easier for guys to find what they want though as girls tend to want serious things (or not). I really can't add more activities than I already do... so like joining the gym (not my thing lol) I am less likely to meet guys. 

I haven't dated anyone in 1 year because I didn't really make an effort.. and genuinely not the people's type here so no one has approached me or complimented me. I am somehow affected by it.. hence why I am willing to put money in but it is sooo expensive and doesn't guarantee anything.

I knew she was on and off with her ex but she told me they were done for good at one point and made hints about wanting me. So we made a real date to go to a baseball game to get drunk and have fun. 

Sometime during that period I found out they were talking again and called her out on it and called off the date. Told her I liked her but didnt wanna get between you two and not interested in wasting my time if it wasnt mutual. She apologized and said she was sorry for being a mess and that she understands why I'm doing it. 

 She stopped contact with me everywhere for about three weeks. Then she very quickly started talking,touching and flirting with me a lot again at work. Then she opened the lines up of communication on text when she heard I became an uncle. Then after weeks ignoring my snap stories she viewed it one night and hit me up on their too. We use to talk on all three constantly. I didnt make a single first move since ending it so I thought it was obvious she wanted me again but I find out on fb she is still talking/hanging with her ex.

 I feel like he just keeps manipulating her and guilting her into keeping him around. Especially from everything ive heard about them two. He still tries to post pics of them but she doesnt even like or comment on any of them and never post any thing with him in it. I cant help but feel she still sticks around cause of pity cause she's a ""good person"" and is scared of something new. Dude is really really needy. 

 I want to get over her because clearly she isnt ready yet but i also still really want her. What do i do? Do I just keep ignoring her? Or do I really just have to grow a set and steal her from her ex? I'm confused. I thought I made it obvious I was into her and wanted her but not if her ex is still in picture. I'm just so mad about this situation. I know she's been through and is scared to try with someone new especially at her age but what the fuck? She acts like she cares about me but why try to come back into my life if she isn't ready? What should I do? What do you do when you're stuck between wanting them and getting over them? 

Tldr; ended seeing and hanging out with a girl/coworker I really liked cause she was still talking with her ex. We mostly stopped talking everywhere.  A month later she tries to come back into my life on everything but it's clear her ex is still in the picture. What is her problem? What should I do? Especially when I told her I wanted her and had no intention of getting between them? What do?",2019-07-07 17:28:42,5,1,dating_advice
67,ca9d6j,SadFrogo,Need help. Feel like I pressured my date too much. How to recover.,"Hey guys, first post so please dont crucify me in case this post breaks any rules.

So basically the situation is as follow:

I (m21) didnt date for quite some time now (study, work, etc.) but recently met a nice girl (f22). Shared phone numbers rather quickly, had a small chat, she invited to me some party she was going to, we had a fun time. Before she left we agreed on meeting again soon, this time just the two of us. She even texted me later that night she had a good time.

So far so good. Now here comes the catch. Due to my ""abstinence"" of feelings for some time now, the feelings this time hit me a bit harder than expected if one can say so. 

Beeing somewhat overwhelmed, I prematurely wrote her the day after, wether she wants to meet this very weekend, since we're both busy during weekdays.

Unfortunately I didnt think enough before hitting send and from this point on its downhill.

She did not have time that weekend and we text way less. I can definitely feel my text came way too fast and she feels pressured. Her responses come slower and its clear she tries to gain some distance.

Now I've basically given up at that point, but it really hurts because it's been a while and I really had fun.

Hence my posting here. Is there anything I can do? Any chance to revert what I did?

I'll be seeing her once this week at work probably, and one more time guaranteed in a non-work context, next weekened, as there is a party we'll both attend. It's probably my last shot.

Any advice would be appreciated.

PS: A friend of mine said, she is that defensive because she's afraid I took her declining as a sign of her not being interested, but I doubt thats anything but talk to cheer me up.",2019-07-07 17:27:36,1,1,dating_advice

70,ca97ub,alyria999,23F consistently confused by men's texting behavior,"Hey all, 23F here looking for a serious relationship via the usual apps (Bumble, Hinge, etc.). Lately I've been encountering some odd (to me) texting behavior from men and I'm wondering if someone can explain.

1. I've had two dates recently with men both \~5 years older than me. Both were so-so, and I was feeling unsure whether I wanted to see them again. Both left the date with no effort to ask for my number (we'd set up the date on Bumble) or plan a second date, yet both continued to message me on Bumble the next day. Neither showed any indication of wanting to plan another date, yet kept the conversation going. I stopped responding to both--but a week after I stopped, one of the guys randomly sent a link to a video we'd discussed in person. What's up with this? If I was a guy who wanted a second date, I'd be sure to leave with a girl's number and set up a second date ASAP.
2. Men immediately wanting me to ""follow"" them to another app and message on Instagram or via text rather than in a dating app. What's the point? I'd rather not give someone access to my social media or phone number until I've met or am about to meet them irl. (Yes, I know that men often want the freedom to exchange more sexual messages...but the few times I've let the conversation move to instagram this hasn't actually happened, and I make it pretty clear in my profile that I'm not looking for a hookup.)

Can anyone tell me why men do these things? In all these cases it seems like me and these guys just aren't a match, so I'm more curious than anything else. Is there something I'm doing to invite this behavior?",2019-07-07 17:15:00,1,1,dating_advice

74,ca7wkt,esha234567,The guy left me hanging after being with me for one day," am in college and there was a senior in my college. With whom I connected emotionally. He had a long term  relationship of 7 years and broke up a year back. He shares everything with me and is very caring towards me.. he told me he liked me from the initial days and have feelings for me. 
And we did make out. But I am a virgin so I was somewhat awkward with him. And didnt allow him to get too close but he was considerate of my feelings and listened to me..he even said this was not a one time thing..and he would like to take thos forward..but the  next day he got fired from his job..he is jobless now.he Is in a really dark place and he got drunk and told me he is not my type..and he is aloof... But he is texting very rarely and offline most of the time and not picking up calls. I asked him if I am causing any disturbance..and he said not at all..and I asked why r you avoiding me and he said not avoiding just that I am not sure about us and dont want to hurt you unless I am sure about it. I asked if I should stop texting him..he said I want you to text me. Then I asked what he wants whether it is related to the job or his feelings are gone..and he said he doesn't know he wants us to be friends more than what is undefined between us.

75,ca7wg5,jonwhoknowsnothing,Advice for new love interest,"I (M25) matched with a girl (F21) on tinder and talked with her for 10 days (actually texted 5 of the 10 days) on whatsapp and we really clicked. We had a date planned and on the day of the date everything is perfect, we talked all night and laughed. There was no physical touching. When i took her back to her uni halls (she is in my country for a course for 1 more month) she invited me upstairs to check the view as she is on the 7th floor.  After talking about it a bit, because the receptionist was gonna check me, we decided to try the back door.  So there I was in her room, I didn't know what to do so I decided to leave after a while as she had to pack cause she had a weekend excursion with the uni.  But as we hugged goodbye there was this uncontrollable feeling that i wanted her and she wanted me, so we ended up having sex. She was ecstatic and seemed to be into it a lot.  Once we were done, i proceeded by dressing up and she was hugging me as i was doing that. She told me she wished she didn't have to wake up so early but we said goodnight and i left.  Next day i texted her i had a really great time with her and she replied the same.  I sent her a text again recommending some places to visit during her excursion but she replied a long after.  Next day i texted her about a place i thought she would like but she did not reply.  I was confused so I checked tinder and i see that her location changed to the other city.

During the date we said that we would both like to have lunch together the following week, but now I'm confused.  I know nothing serious can happen as we are both leaving the country soon but i would love to pursue it for as long as i can since i really clicked with her.

Should i stop contacting her for a few days and see what happens? Should i try reminding her of the lunch date a day before?  I have plenty of matches but i really like this girl.

76,c9wbyf,TossOutAccount69,Tinder tips: bio and photos,"I have seen many posts on here asking for tips and help with dating apps, particularly Tinder. I (23M) am writing this from the perspective of someone looking to find a relationship, not a hookup. I have used Tinder heavily for over a year and have gone on dates with people I matched with. I also have Tinder Gold, so if anyone has questions about that, or anything else I've written, don't hesitate to ask!

&amp;#x200B;

**Bio**

* have one! I see so many empty profiles. To me, that says ""I took the time to download the app, create an account, put in my name and age, and add these fine pics, but I couldn't take an extra minute to write something, ANYTHING, about myself."" If I'm being honest, I will usually just swipe left if I see an empty bio (...unless you have a gorgeous smile)
* that said, bios which are unoriginal and cliche are almost just as likely to make me swipe left as an empty bio. I'm sure everyone has seen a bio that just says ""here for a good time, not a long time."" To be fair, this seems to be code for ""I want a hookup,"" which is fine if that's what you want. But if you're after something more serious, definitely do not use this... UNLESS you plan to put a twist on it and make it fun and creative, like ""here for a good time, not a long time. In other words, I'm looking for a sweet and caring wife but I probably won't live past 87 and I'm already 30% there so let's not get too attached."" Idk, I just came up with that and it's pretty awful but I think it's certainly better than the cliche
* I have found that the most effective bios are either short and funny, leaving me wanting more, or longer and informative, making me like someone's personality and want to talk with them. Short and funny works because you can make a quick, positive first impression in just a sentence or two, and if your sense of humor is something you want to convey, this will get the message across easily. Longer and informative bios work because people will get a better idea of what you're like, and you can still sprinkle in some humor or other aspects of your personality.

&amp;#x200B;

**Photos**

* let's be real: not all, but many people aren't going to even read your amazing bio if your pics suck; I'm talking bad lighting, low resolution, blurry, etc. Don't just take screenshots of your insta, especially if you're not even going to bother cropping out the navigation bar (I don't want to see what cell provider you have and how low your battery was when you took the screenshot). Uploading photos direct from your phone's photo library will guarantee better quality
* a single photo isn't enough to show what you look like, so upload as many as possible! The more you show, the better someone will be able to take each into account and create a mental image of what you look like in person, so the more the better. Every picture is different, and things like your outfit, indoor vs outdoor lighting, pics with or without glasses, and the angle of the camera, will all influence someone's perception of how you look
* smile!!! A photo of you smiling or laughing will make you 69x more attractive than one where you are dead serious or trying to ""look cool."" When we see someone smile in a picture, we usually project positive traits onto them (the halo effect) that make them more desirable: they appear happier, friendly, approachable, down to Earth, etc
* that said, not every photo has to be a smiling selfie. Funny pictures or shots of your favorite activities convey your personality and can spark conversations with your matches. If you're into traveling, cooking, reading, competitive somersaulting, whatever, find/take photos of yourself in those environments, and the photos will do some of the heavy lifting for you that your bio is usually tasked with when it comes to communicating who you are and what you're about
* pay attention not just to how you look in your photos but also the background. Do you really think that bathroom stall is worth showing?
* many people don't seem to be aware of the looping video feature in Tinder. Find a video of yourself doing something cool or fun and select a portion you want to loop that contains a lot of movement, and you have yourself a nice looping video. It definitely draws my attention when I see profiles who knew to use this feature and actually used it. Cool examples I've seen were of people cliff jumping and doing gymnastics, looping back and fourth. Pretty fun to watch!
* my last tip with photos: don't try to hide what you look like. This may be hard for people who feel they are not attractive, but if you are looking for a relationship, trying to hide behind snapchat filters, strategic cropping, older photos where you're in better shape, etc will only spell disaster when you go to meet someone in person and they find that you were being disingenuous about what you look like. Sure, looks aren't everything. But honesty is. Plus, being truthful about your looks will save you wasted time and energy if you find that someone only matched with you and talked to you for your looks, not for what's inside. Honesty and transparency go a long way, and that starts the minute you begin creating your profile and choosing what photos to show

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Write a bio that is fun and different. Show people who you are, and give them a reason to want to swipe right on you over other profiles. Upload as many photos as possible, that are good quality, in different settings and environments. Smile in a few, and show some of your hobbies. Everyone is different and interesting, so try to identify what makes you special and highlight that in your profile. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this has been helpful to somebody! I'm happy to answer any questions or elaborate on anything that wasn't clear :) and I would love to hear tips from other people's experiences on Tinder!",2019-07-06 17:42:41,24,54,dating_advice
77,ca7n1p,jenettabrown,Interested then gone,"Okay I'm going to try to keep this short but I really need some advice or explanation.

So I met this guy 2 weeks ago and for the past two weeks we've been texting and talking a lot. We have a lot in common and he was really adamant on wanting to move forward and looking for a relationship. At first I was a little apprehensive due to being burned in the past but I enjoy talking to him and look forward to hearing from him. 

We scheduled our first date to be dinner and movie, it was a movie we both really wanted to see. The day before our scheduled date he was texting me back and forth regarding how he was excited and where we should go eat and what time should we meet up. Then the day of the date he says that it's too hot to go out to eat even though we hadn't made final plans yet. Then he tried to change what movie we wanted to see.

After going back and forth for a little bit we decided to stick to the movie we agreed on and go to the 6 show. At at 2 p.m. he was running errands  and we were texting back and forth about where we should meet and he told me when he left just or he would call me and that he was super excited to see me. At 3 p.m. I text him asking him if he forgot about me, got no response. At 4:30 p.m. I text asking if he changed his mind, got no response. At 5:30 I called him and his phone went straight to voicemail, and playing off of a hunch I called him on my son's phone and his phone rang. To which then I text and said that I can take a hint and I will be deleting his contact information.

So my reason for posting all of this was to ask what was the point of it? He pursued me, he made the arrangements, he went through all the effort to get my attention and to get me interested in him......... just took ghost me before our first date? What was the point?",2019-07-07 14:51:59,4,1,dating_advice

I know for a fact she likes me a lot as a friend, but don't know if she's in love in me. She does show signs when we're drunk, like touching me a lot, initiating conversations with me constantly, and so forth. When we're not drunk, she's just friendly but nothing more than that. She's fairly shy but nothing too over the top. She's way more experienced romantically and sexually than me, and she's a bit out of my league. I don't know if its my mind wanting her to be in love with me that's making me think she is, or if she's actually into me. But I've been having a crush on her for a long time now. Should I risk asking her out? Is she flirting or just being nice?

So either I ask her out, she says yes, we're both happy.

Or I ask her out, she says no, I'm afraid that things will be really awkward at work and the friend circle will see me differently.

Or I don't ask her out, I don't risk the amazing friendship we have.

So I’m asking for a little help.

I (25F) met this mutual friend (25M) tonight while I was out with some friends, I hadn’t met him/seen him from afar or anything previously.

He was nice, funny etc.

Because of some things going on my life I’m *really* looking for some male company. And I found him extremely attractive.
Honestly I wanted to find a makeout buddy tonight but that didn’t happen.

Anyway. He was making an obscene amount eye contact with me, talking directly to me more so then others, would look up at me whenever I was laughing, and over the night I started trying to break the touch barrier (arm, back, knee etc) and it seemed like he was reciprocating (a small amount), getting closer then needed when talking, letting his arm brush against mine etc

Later I wrapped him and my other female friend in a side hug while we were standing and talking at the bar and he didn’t seem uncomfortable at all.

And finally when we left I hugged him “nice to meet you” etc, and he seemed more than fine it.

However there was no explicit traditional flirting happening, or sexual innuendo or anything.

So my questions are: do you think he was just enjoying the attention, or actually flirting?
And, do you think I missed the boat? Missed his signals? Like I could have done more?

I can't make heads of this situation.The guy I've been seeing for a couple of weeks and really like, has a girl show up saying she's his girlfriend. He claims that's his roommate and she's crazy, controlling,obsessed with him. She even goes out of her way to turn on the car tracker to find him and see who,what,where he's doing or talking-to. He said he never dated her or slept with her,just hung out with her until she didn't want to anymore. Tonight I went over to the house they both rent a room from,she wasn't there and was aware I was coming over to play video games. She came home around 11pm and started saying I need to leave,it's her house because she's paying for everything,the cars are hers because the insurance is in her name and that I need to ""quit f#cking him because we're in a relationship"". I left but he didn't really defend us,he just kinda of acted like a scolded child. He argued with her about using a car to take me home and,she said no because she doesn't want him too. The vehicles and house all belong to the homeowner not to her,but because she's been there longer she's controlling everything.

I can't make out weather she's just really crazy or if they really are in a relationship. This is the 2nd time she's basically told me to back off he's hers.",2019-07-07 14:13:14,2,1,dating_advice

I don't want a relationship, I sometimes hookup with people but that's it. 

The thing is, he seems to flirt with me a lot. I'm not sure if he actually is or if it's just his personality though. I let it happen because I like flirting, it's fun and makes me feel good.

If he were flirting, I wouldn't mind, he's cool and it boots my ego, but I think it would be a terrible idea for us to hook up (he seems quite intense so i feel like it would ruin our friendship and probably change the dynamic of our group of friends) so I don't want to lead him on...

94,ca4dev,P4LK0,Am I being unreasonable and too insecure ?,"Hi, 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm 26 years old male who is very introverted and spends a lot of the time indoors but might go with that one friend to a pub for a pint or two once or so a year. Am I being unreasonable and too insecure by expecting my future SO to not attend clubs and pubs when we are in relationship ? I know what happens in clubs and I'm scared something will happen when my future SO goes there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a simillar train of thoughts when it comes to pubs when for example SO goes with her single friends to a pub. I think in both cases I'm scared about being cheated on and ending up with my feelings hurted. It looks like I have that shield that tries to protect me from being hurt too much sometimes. In both cases I'm scared of being cheated on, I don't want to experience it either and I never have been cheated on too. I have never cheated on anyone either. 

&amp;#x200B;

95,ca6u3j,JazzlikeYear7,I don't know how to handle this...,"A close friend(20f) and I(20m) have been talking since May (I will attach the previous threds about this at the end of the post).  The other night, we were at a party and she was really drunk. I had gotten there a few hours after her and she was already really drunk.  About an hour after I had gotten there, she had blacked out and doesn't remember the rest of the night. 

This is where it gets interesting. After she blacked out, she, as casually as a drunk person can, brought up possibly making our relationship official (keep in mind we have been getting coffee/breakfast together once a week for a while along with going to bars together since may).  She then proceeds to ask how long I've had a crush on her, and I manage to get her to answer her question before I do. She has apparently had a crush on me since freshman year of college (we are juniors, so about 1.5 to 2 years).

After this night, she invited me to her family's camp to go wakeboarding and wake surfing.  My question is, what do I do with this info?  I know people say alcohol is a truth serum, but I have also heard that you shouldn't take things too seriously. I just feel confused because I don't want to make it too awkward.

TLDR: Close friend that I've been talking to and going on dates with admits that she likes me while black out drunk and I don't know what to do.

96,ca32r9,barononwheels,Loneliness has followed me for 20 years... I don't know what to do,"Hello. I'm a 20 year old man. I've been alone for all my life; never had a girlfriend... or anything close to one anyway. All my life I have seen a lot of other people dating others (even the assholes get girls...of course)... but it never happens to me. It's not because I am not interested in women; I would really love to get a girl. It just doesn't happen to me, I guess. I have had my fair share of girls I have liked... but of course it never works out for me. One of them even sweared at me and let other people know when she knew I liked her. It wasn't very nice. At least that was a long time ago. Well, I am not really in a situation to meet girls right now anyway, even if I wanted to. I am in South Korea, my home, which I will leave in a couple months, since I study in America. Even without the geographical situation aspect, I am heavily depressed; I've been depressed for eight years now. It's ironic because my depression makes me want to go get someone, but also makes it much harder for me to go get someone. It's tough. Night after night I feel very lonely. It's getting harder and harder for me to bear. 

&amp;#x200B;

By saying being alone it's not only in terms of getting girls but just in general. I mean it doesn't mean that I am totally friendless, but it's pretty similar to that situation, I guess. Even right now I am in the middle of my summer break, and I haven't seen anyone for over a week. Every day I just waste my time filling the void (playing video games or surfing the internet I guess), because I have nothing better to do. My whole life has been a waste, to be honest. Even my interests seem like empty things that I have chose, just to fill the empty void. As I say again, I am not completely friendless, but they are more like acquaintances than friends. Even my friends (at least those of my age) that I have don't really know the things I suffer from. I just hang around with them sometimes and that is it. They don't really know who I really am. My family don't really know about me that much either. I don't genuinely trust them anyway, because they are one of the major causes of my depression. I know those people would not understand. I don't expect them to, and I don't want them to. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I was a kid I just wasn't very social; I don't seem to really fit in anywhere. All my life during school I haven't had friends, and often been bullied. People don't really like me. My interests are different from ""normal"" people; they aren't that interesting (at least for most people around my age, especially women) either. I mean there are a lot of unique people that interests people but not me. I'm a very average person, in a way, but don't really fit in any sort of crowd. I am unique in a way, but in a rather not so good way. Just like a bent fork, I guess. A bent fork is unique, but nobody likes bent forks; they are useless and not even that good to look at. And when a fork is bent most people just throw them away.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem that I suffer is that everyone else seems distant to me. As I said, even my friends and my family don't really know me very well, and I want to keep it that way (especially my family). Regarding other people, I do have a mindset that is sort of like a ""Me and them"" mindset. And I could never be part of ""them"". This has been a continuous thing, both in Korea and in America. For example, I didn't even know what the words ""lit"" and ""vines"" meant until I went to college last year (You may say that this is because I am not American, but most Korean kids I have seen who are fluent in English as I am know what they are). I still don't use those words because it just isn't like ""me"". Since my lifestyle and my interests are different from those of most people, the distantness that I feel becomes worse and worse, every time I look through social media and other stuff. Everyone else seems to live in a better world than mine (I do know that people post it to seem like they are having a good time and it's an empty facade but still). It's a facade, but still it does have an element of truth in it, doesn't it? I mean if I see it for a day or two, I would be fine... but it's been like this for years now. And every time I feel that something is definitely wrong with my life. Something definitely happened in my life... or maybe... something happened to everyone else, but didn't happen to me. I don't know. You can see it either way I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

A good fictional character which I can relate myself to would be Travis Bickle from the film Taxi Driver. I'm god's lonely man. I relate more towards the loneliness part than the violence part though; I used to be violent but now I've numbed down a lot. People may think it's a good thing, but I don't think so. The violent part I used to have means that I was more alive back then. At least that's how I view it. I seem to become more violent when I become depressed and scared. People tend to use the word ""anxiety"" to describe that feeling, but I would like to stick to use the words ""feeling scared"", because that's how I think it is. If I get too ""scared"" I become like a poor rabid animal, someone once very accurately described me. Scared people can do, and say scary things. I do not want to become like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't really know what to do. Especially when I go back to NYC, where people seem even more distant, more far away. I would like some hope in my life but it's hard to get.",2019-07-07 04:43:57,6,5,dating_advice
97,ca6sll,kitkat12222222,Help on next steps with this guy,"Background:

I (23F) have been talking to and hanging out with this guy (26M) for about a month. Things have been a steady kind of good. Some awkward moments but overall good. We mainly chat over the phone (not text) to discuss meeting up to go out (this isn’t a primarily sex based relationship). 

After the third week I realized that he isn’t as touchy like he used to be and when we switched to more texting, it’d be dry af. The last time I saw him he had someone blowing up his phone to the point where he had to turn it off. 

I brought it up the next day and he told me a close friend of his passed away. I expressed my condolences and also asked if he was still interested in me since I was getting vibes that he wasn’t. He said this wasn’t the case.

It’s been almost two weeks now and he won’t reach out unless I reach out and I kinda feel silly for waiting around for him.

98,ca6rca,GooeySooey,"Went on a date with my best friends younger sisters best friend, to find out she’s hiding a boyfriend and now things are confusing.","As the title reads, I (23M) went on a date recently with my best friends younger sisters best friend(20F), to only find out from my friend that she’s apparently not single.

Last year we started talking at every party we’d be at, she’d initiate it and eventually i noticed she’d always be around me at parties. Our conversations would last after party hours and usually until we passed out. We never hung out one on one, then stopped talking when she went to school.

A month ago, back from school, at a party we hung out all night again, and a week ago went out one on one. We had a great time, and made plans again for this upcoming week - but after we hung out I’ve been hearing a little less from her then before. She texted me how she was happy we finally did that, but then after I’ve gotten less replies and a little less communication.

My best friend yesterday told me she’s actually in a (unhealthy) relationship with someone back in school. This guy is also her first real boyfriend.

She’s clearly interested in me, but it seems she’s pretty conflicted as well. How do you think this situation should be handled?

Some options in my head:

1. Ask her about the boyfriend situation, why we talk so much and why we are now seeing eachother. This seems the best option but I dont want to come off as needy. 
2. Give her space, cut communication outside of making plans and just go with the flow until she figures it out.
3. Back off completely, keep the plans we made but after that politely only see her when I see her at mutual places.
4. Keep up the pace I’ve created with back and forth snaps/texts and wait for her to come around.

My main concern with this situation is that her being my best friends sisters best friend - is that I don’t want to come off in any wrong way. I dont want to be overbearing if she wants space, and I dont want to be uncaring by bailing if she’s in a tough spot. I also don’t want to come in between anything.

I know to put myself first, which I have always done - but being in between hanging out to finding out she’s not single puts me in a tough scenario!

104,ca2n2g,Throwaway17937835,"Met the coolest girl ever, she offered me her number, not sure how to proceed","Hey reddit! Actually created an account for this.

First, a little about me: 20m, decently handsome, currently serving in the military of the country I live in. I'm able to get off base for a weekend every 2 weeks or so.

Her: 20f, stunningly beautiful, brilliantly smart, also in the military but serves in a different place. Also able to get off about every 2 weeks. Obviously, if anything were to happen there would be scheduling issues. 

So here's what happened: we met at some event and started chatting. Hit it off right away, as she's super friendly, funny and cool. At some point it came up that she has a professional connection that might be helpful to me, so she offers me their number.
I take out my phone to write it down, assuming she would take out hers to get the number. She didn't even bother taking hers out and instead grabs mine, saying, ""it's actually just easier if I give you mine.""
She writes down her phone number, then actually takes the time to take a profile picture for her contact file (believe me, it's a great photo)! She saves the contact and hands me back my phone.
The event continues and we're still chatting. Afterwards we realized that both of us plus a group of my friends were walking in the same direction (her to a bus stop, me to a friend's place), so we all walked together still chatting.
As we're approaching her bus stop, her bus is pulling up so she says it was great to meet and she's gonna run. As she's walking away I kind of lamely said something like, ""Hey, we should do something sometime."" She responds, ""Cool,"" and gets on her bus.

Guys, this girl is seriously cool. We have a ton in common, she's got an amazing personality and an even better smile. I think it's pretty obvious from the way she gave me her number that she's interested, and clearly so am I. But how do I go forward? Is it even possible to initiate a relationship with these kinds of scheduling conflicts? At this point our first date couldn't even be for another two weeks, and after that we'd see each other only about that often. My texting game sucks and I'm worried I'd mess it up in between seeing her.

107,ca6ahy,arslanicrew002,How To Stop Loving Someone | 5 STEPS,"Love is a stubborn feeling. But it does not mean that it cannot be corrected when it is wrong. Love does not have to overcome your best judgment. Now, if you are stuck in the difficult situation of how to stop loving someone, I have here easy solutions that you can try. In addition to helping you repair a broken heart, these steps will also allow you to make a better life for yourself after being abandoned.

It is complicated to know how to stop loving someone who does not love you. However, when you have to face a break, this is the first thing you need to learn and move on. Making someone love you back is not in your hand, because you can’t control other person’s feelings for you. So, if that person does not feel for you, then it’s a time to move on. Here in this post, we are going to share 14 Steps to stop liking someone. It will surely help you.

***Read This:*** [6 Ways To Get Over Rejection](https://ezeehow.com/how-to-get-over-rejection/)

### 1- Focus on Something That Satisfies you

Focus on those things that make you feel good about you. It can be work, a concert that is completely out of place, like being a DJ or making account accessories. Or it can be participating in some charity events. Whatever it is, you must change your focus from your ex to that particular activity and spend all the time and energy you have in it. Distraction will help you stop loving someone.

### 2- Talk with Your Family and Friends

Having a relationship cut off abruptly in the outbreak can be a bit destabilizing and humiliating. And in these moments, you need to be close to people who accept you for whomever you are and who will not leave you for any reason. In that way, you won’t feel the absence of love in your life and you will find some available resources to repair a broken heart.

### 3- Get a Pet

I would recommend dogs since they are interactive and have a longer lifespan. But you can choose between any of the animals that inhabit this land. The pets are very funny. And they give you a purpose. Besides that, they can give you a tremendous amount of love and loyalty in exchange for the little attention and care you can provide. Now, who would not love that creature more than an ex?

### 4- Change Your Perspective

Your perception will be understandable and obscure after the breakup. But you always have the option to wear pink glasses and look at life from a positive point of view. That would make you feel that there is more to hope for and, therefore, we encourage you to fix a broken heart and prepare it for the next great encounter with love.

### 5- Embrace Your Freedom

A one-sided relationship always limits you to see the beautiful world around you. It only makes you a critical person who always look at the negative side. Well, now that you have lost that limitation, why not explore what it means to be single and fly to a tropical paradise, participate in unique adventures in life. Start living for yourself, not for anyone else. When you will experience the world from it’s both sides, you will know how to stop loving someone and control your feelings.

A week ago Saturday we got pretty hot and heavy and had incorporated sexting (no pics, just that we want to hook up and what we would do with each other). She seemed to be absolutely into it. Then the texts got super skanty by Monday this week, and Friday she hit me with a big text saying there's stuff going on in her life and she wants to focus on that, sorry for any confusion. Naturally it left me confused as 
We never mentioned anything about a relationship, but I'm assuming she has someone else. I played it cool and said I understand and I'm here if she wants to talk to anyone and left it at that. I saw her at work Friday and helped her with something in the day (I didn't act any different, but no make out session or anything as I told her I would give her space). So after work she texted me thanks for helping, and I said no problem, I'm always there to help, regardless of anything. We had a little small talk and I said a joke ""even though you broke up with me via text"" followed by a lol and that I'm just messing with her. Her response was ""stopppp :("" and we spoke a little more and she said ""we are on the same boat"" about a project at work, once again I stupidly texted ""nope, I got thrown overboard by you"" and after that no response. Basically what I'm asking is I know she may have someone else or felt intimidated by us hooking up, hence why she just abruptly sent that ""I'm going though stuff"" text; but were my texts too passive aggressive? I feel like I went from supportive to somewhat a jerk which would turn her off even more. I guess since I was teased so bad from her I can't stop thinking about her and hope there is still a chance since she seems to change her mind at a drop of a dime, I'm super attracted to her :/

Then the more I spoke to her the less the replies got, the less enthusiastic she seemed, which obviously made me want her more then, so after 12 months of talking I finally come home thinking we are gonna start this for real, I get home, and she tells me she has severe anxiety which prevents her from meeting one on one with someone she isn't comfortable with as it terrifies her, so I understood and we arranged something with friends, met up a few times and nothing has progressed at all, we've kissed , and we will go through stages of having 1 great week(online communication) and being really nice and couple like to then her being distant for 2 weeks and everytime I mention meeting she ignores it, agrees and then backs out last minute, or the messages become less and less, every few months I mention how much I like her and want to meet and start something but nothing comes of it, I'm at my wits end, so does she just want me to feed and stroke her ego as I'm her ""online security boyfriend just incase"" and should I leave? as every time I start messaging less and less she panics and becomes nice again or do I stay grin and bare it and wait in the hope something happens?",2019-07-07 11:27:17,1,1,dating_advice

112,ca01we,chioces,Why do guys refuse to take it slow.,"I met a guy the other day. We went on a date, it went well. He touched my back, my shoulder, pulled me close. And he tried to kiss me. I shied away the first time, second time, third time. Eventually I realized that he wasn’t taking the hint. At all. So I said, very kindly: I do like you, but I prefer to take things slow. Is that ok? 
He said: of course! We should only do things that make you feel comfortable! And proceeded to pull me up against him and try to kiss me again. 

So I said: for me intimacy is very... intimate, for lack of a better word. And it’s important for me to get to know someone before jumping into anything. 
He said: of course! We should only do things that make you feel comfortable! And then: but don’t you feel like we’ve known each other forever? 

Well, first of all, no, I don’t and him repeating it 10 times isn’t going to change that, and second, I’ve said no. Why am I being ignored??? 

The thing is, this isn’t the first time I’ve found myself in this situation, even in the last month. I don’t know how to say: I do find you interesting enough to get to know you, but please stop trying to grope me, I’ve known you for less that 24 hours and it makes me uncomfortable. 

I really am trying to set the boundary in a clear and kind way, but all I’m getting in response is an: of course! And then they keep going as though I hadn’t said a single word.

The thing is, she is usually the one that starts the convos and comes online immediately when I reply her. I can tell that she likes me obviously as she asks questions on sex and we get into really deep talks.

 It has been 2 days now and I'm starting to feel like she is more interested in me than I'm interested in her. She is the first girl ever to show interest in me and I dont want to reject her. I'm starting to have a bit of feelings for her the more we talk but I feel it is very rush as it has only been 2 days. She talks more in text than in person to me. However she is very extroverted and outgoing so maybe she was just shy when she met me. She asks me a lot of questions like ""are you single?"" or ""what would u want your gf to do in that situation if u had one?"" so it's pretty clear she is into me. Personally I dont want to lose her but yet I have no interest in dating anyone now whatsoever and I'm only half interested in her.

 Any suggestions on what I should do as I'm very confused now. I've never dated or had a gf before so maybe that is why i dont want to lose her. She is the only shot I got to getting a girlfriend as I dont have to chase her at all.",2019-07-07 10:49:31,3,1,dating_advice

120,ca19do,lalvarez35,How do I tell someone I like them when I haven't talked to her in 4 years?,"This is my first post on Reddit (Mobile)

Recently I (18M) realized that I have always had feelings for my friend (18F). I think that these feelings have surfaced since I just graduated High School and can't stop thinking about her. I have always been an awkward and shy kid and all my friends were made because they decided to talk to me. I'm your basic anti-social kid and can barely talk to a guy let alone a girl. I don't know how to start talking to her or even if she did like me or not. All I remember is talking to her in class and laughing having the best time together.

I don't know if it's my mind making up memories but I am sure that she had some feeling for me too. We talked and laughed so much that the teacher actually had to separate us and put her 7 rows behind me. She was the one that started to message me but being the awkward kid I am I couldn't even text her right. I actually texted her the SpongeBob theme song because I didn't know how to talk to her (yeah it was that bad). I remember she left me a voicemail minutes long with silence and with her it ending with her saying my name and laughing for me to answer. 

She just randomly pops into my head and I just get biggest smile on my face. I'm pretty sure she has just forgotten about me and didn't/doesn't like me. How do I talk to her? What do I tell her? I don't even know what I want her to say or do? My mentality right now is for her to randomly notice me and start talking to me out of nowhere. I've been ranting on Twitter about my feelings.

126,ca4zl3,963632,I think I’m about to ruin the best friendship I’ve had in years.,"Hey, I’m a 27/M (throwaway account because obviously) and I’ve had a rough year, probably the worst in many areas. However, I’ve been able to cope with it because of my family, therapy and my current best friend (28/F) We both had our self esteem crushed when we started hanging out (two years ago) and it turned into the best friendship I’ve had, I can talk to her about everything and we always discover new things about each other.

Thing is, I fell madly in love with her. We made out once, proper made out, but nothing came out of it. When I told her I had feelings afterwards (about a year ago) she made it quite clear that she didn’t feel the same, not at the moment at least she said, that I was her best friend and she wouldn’t lose me over such a thing. I took it hard, but we never stoped hanging out. She’s been a pilar on which I can stand on in hard situations and I wouldn’t dream of being any less for her, ever.

Recently, people that used to be friends with her just trashed her, as if they were 15yo gossipy toddlers, assholes. Two of them came to my house to get info from me about her and I just wouldn’t have it, I told them to fuck off. I now feel I’m responsible to inform my friend that they suck, that she should never waste another synapsis in such assholes and that she deserves better, that she should never feel sad over them again.

Well, back to me, yadda yadda bad year, but in that very moment I realized that what I feel is destroying me. I need to focus, to process stuff and to let myself grow out of this rut I’ve been in all year long, but I won’t be able to if she’s around. She became the girl that I want to make happy, the girl I picture myself sharing every dream I’ve had when before I just pictured myself alone, I wish she could see even for a second how much she’s worth through my eyes, and I have to tell her. I need to tell her that I have to distance myself from her because of it, that knowing that she will never love me back is destroying me.

I feel like an asshole for taking her best friend away, and I’m very unhappy picturing the time I won’t be able to goof off with her, how lonely I’ll feel. However, I need to grow up and stop my frustration, and I need to be mature enough to bring up the subject as honestly and directly as possible. It TERRIFIES ME that the friendship will be over, that she’ll feel betrayed (or even worse, used) but I don’t know what to do other than venting it here :(

I tried breaking up with my ex many times over the course of past two months. We’ve only been together for six months, including those two months of off-and-on. Break up reason: his debilitating depression and anxieties. 

He claims I’m the perfect girl and that I’m the only girl he’s ever loved — and will ever love. 

He says he’s not giving up and not letting me go. He wants to “get better” so he can deserve me, because he knows I deserve so much more. 

Part of me feels this is touchingly romantic — his undying loyalty and pursuit of me. On the other hand I find this concerning and alarming because he’s not respecting my choice to end the relationship. I feel like he’s almost manipulating me to stay.

Now, here's the conundrum,

I'm madly in love with his sister (18F) (Almost 19). You can say I'm ""18"" and ""Don't know what love is"" but I honestly don't care, I love her. I know I do. He knows this, and didn't want me to date her (which may have been a reason why our friendship ended.) But here's the thing though, I asked her out to a movie during the last week of school, and she said yes, but we never went on this date since this situation with her brother. I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place, do I follow my heart and make things even worse between us? Do I just give up and loose the potential for an amazing relationship (Everyone admits we're perfect for each other, even him)? Would a relationship between us even be pragmatic because of this? This is honestly one of the most confusing times in my life, and I need advice.",2019-07-07 04:22:02,7,2,dating_advice

I met her at a really low point and I can’t tell if my love for her is really just me being deprived of any affection for so long. Like I’ve never actually felt this way before so there is feelings there I just don’t understand it. There’s some reasons that I’m worried like we’re so attached and the sex is really good, so I feel like I can’t even think clearly right now. I’m also basically living in her car which I didn’t think much of but now I feel like I’m using her because my feelings are so confused. I feel more of like a mom son connection which sounds fucked up but like I do feel strangely connected to her I just don’t feel like it’s in a healthy way. I also have never really been in deep with a person so I’m wondering if I’m just overthinking so much because I’m in uncharted territory. Another thing is I’m so disregulated in regard to sleeping and eating considering I work overnight 40hrs a week and am homeless. That has to be playing a big role I would think and I’m smoking so much weed that half the time I’m in a damn cloud.

While discussing hobbies, she mentioned a movie she wanted to watch and I asked not really expecting a yes if she wanted to go watch it with me. To my surprised she agreed and gave me her phone number. Over the week I have been sending her texts on where to go and when. She has been responding and have decided where and when to meet up; but every time I text her it might take some hours or even a day to get a response that is usually one short sentence. I seem to overthink this as meaning she really isn't into me or her saying yes was simply out of pity. Although thinking logically I know she is most likely busy since I know she works. Is this something I should be worried about? Am i just blowing it out of proportion? 

Also, when I send her messages it usually is just like what are her preferences on where to go eat or if this time is fine for her and so one. I could say I sent her 6 messages in total. Am I messing up? I dont really have too much dating experience and resent have started to build up my self esteem. Any advice or help is appreciated.",2019-07-07 07:59:39,4,1,dating_advice

I’d like to explore the field more, but I’m having trouble on how to respectfully and confidently approach/talk to women without coming on too strong and also giving her opportunities to show her interest (or lack of).

Last Wednesday we went on a date and really hit it off. Conversation over drinks and dinner was fun. We laughed at lot, it also got deep. We talked about our past relationships. Seeing as we're the same age and we have only really been in one LTR we had a lot in common about that. From there we went to an arcade and had a blast. Played a bunch of games, I felt like a kid again. I got a little stuffed animal key chain. 

She wanted me to make a move but I didn't, but I heard her say something  and I didn't let her leave until we kissed. 

So we're going to go on a second date tomorrow. We made a bet and if she wins she says she wants a back massage. I'm guessing she's talking about sex.

I'm terrible at making moves because I guess I was in my last relationship so long and I've never really been in the dating scene. I feel nervous and forced.

&amp;#x200B;

So two weeks ago I downloaded a dating app and did what people do. I got matched with this girl. We chatted for a few days but her responses were becoming slower with every passing day. So I decided to stop the chatting and asked her to meet with me and she said yes! We set the time and the place and she agreed to both. I asked her if she likes the time and the place and she said yes. That was last week. Then I asked her for the phone number and she quickly messaged me on her phone. I was happy and spent the week looking forward to meeting her. I did not message her until yesterday and asked if she is still good to go. No response. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sent another message today asking if she saw my last message and if our plan changed. No response. I decided to go anyway since the place was close to my house. I waited for 40 minutes. No one showed up.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the point of all of this is that I now realize that I am an idiot. I should have seen the signs but my excitement blurred my decisions. Do not be an idiot like me. More importantly, please do not do this to people. It is very damaging. A simple ""sorry I am no longer interested"" would have been a much better thing to do.

156,ca45vc,thetrueprimo,I don’t understand why everyone on this sub is concerned about texting?,"I’ve noticed there are many instances where people simply don’t get texts for long periods of time. Other times people do and ask what they mean only to be answered with “Wow, it is a good sign he/she ACTUALLY texted you.” 

Personally I don’t understand this. Even before my first little date/hangout with this girl I’ve been talking to her via snapchat (basically texting) constantly. The longest space between messages happened today, 2 weeks into our streak, which was 3 hours only because she had a super busy day at work.  

Maybe it is a product of my generation? (18y) But I feel even if texting was my only means of communication that messages would be much more common and continuous than what most of you describe in your experiences here. Frankly, if I didn’t get a reply or a message within a couple hours or a goodnight message after a date I would think they are uninterested. 

I guess my only reasoning for this is generational preferences for phone usage and the prominence of social media outlets like snapchat that allow users to engage visually as well as textually resulting in deeper and longer lasting conversations. 

Anyhow, I’m wondering what ya’ll think about this?

TL:DR: Communication habits amongst different generations result in instances that people in this sub write about that seem completely foreign and would easily raise red flags in the dating world for me, but not for them.",2019-07-07 07:11:06,2,1,dating_advice

160,ca3y3t,NoSugarNoIcePlz,I[28F] feel I can never be my boyfriend’s[29M] priority and I don’t know how to deal with it,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for 9 months now and I feel he’s amazing and our relationship has been progressing really well. I’ve met one of his very close brother, both of his parents and I’m really appreciated that he seems to be very serious about this relationship. We were both not from this country but his brother lives in the same state and his parents visit them at least once a year. My parents live in another country (in Asia) and they don’t speak English so it’s a little difficult for them to visit me more often.  

Since I’ve met his family I really want him to meet my parents as well. So I asked him a couple of months ago if he wants to do a trip in Asia and we can also meet my parents and also to celebrate both of our birthdays. He already got a few of trips this year and he thinks it’s a little tiring so I didn’t push him to give me an answer. Two weeks ago he told me his brother also wants to do a trip in Asia and he’s excited . I felt upset because it was my idea first and felt he rejected me but then just accepted whatever his brother proposed, which basically is the same trip. We then talked about it and he apologized that he didn’t mean to do that. He will plan the trip with me and his brother might join with us for a part of the trip if I’m ok. 

I’m ok but then figuring out the time for three people seems difficult. His brother wants to do it in early September while I can only do it in early to mid October. He thought about he could do two trips with each of us separately but I worried about him since it could be super tiring since he needs to to two overseas trips within two months. Anyway we couldn’t get it work and later he told me his brother suggested they can go to Asia while me and my bf can go somewhere else later this year. 

I can tell my boyfriend has been stressful about figuring out all this and I understand he’s really close to his brother and wants to spend time with him. But I can’t help to feel hurt that he basically is doing a trip with his entire family including this brother this month and he will go to Asia with his brother while this whole Asia trip thing was my idea first. 

I asked if my BF doesn’t want to meet my parents but he said he would love to meet them. It’s just the two trips to Asia makes him tired. And I asked what if he and his brother go somewhere else and he could go to Asia with me he said his brother doesn’t want to go anywhere else. 

I don’t know what to think and what to say. I can tell my BF loves me 100% but I feel i can never be his priority when it comes with his brother. I don’t know how to handle this emotion. 

TLDR: both me and my bf’s brother want to go to a trip to Asia. He chose his brother over me. I don’t know how to handle my hurt feelings since I suggested this trip to celebrate our birthdays and meet my parents.",2019-07-07 06:39:51,3,1,dating_advice

In DESPERATE Need of Relationship Advice,"For some, this may be difficult to digest/believe, but I won several million dollars in the Powerball very recently. I bought a few quick pick tickets. I'm choosing not disclose the actual amount for privacy purposes, but anyway, that's beside the point.

As of right now, the only people I've disclosed my winning to is my parents. I'm currently in the process of finding a financial advisor and team that I can TRUST, which, believe it or not, is a fucking task. But I suppose the point of this post is to seek some help as to how to handle the pressing issue of telling my partner.

I have a boyfriend whom I met last year around September in college, and we started dating in January. It's been almost 8 months now, and we've both since transferred from that particular school and have been doing the long-distance thing since mid-May. Our relationship has been rocky... we're both young (under 22) and learning. He's a genuine guy, and we've even had late-night discussions about what we'd each do if we won the lottery (ironic, right).

My worry is that the dynamic of our relationship will completely shift. Although we love each other, ANYONE would be tempted to become not-so-genuine in a situation where their partner becomes spontaneously rich. I really want this to work, because he's someone who loved me before I came into this wealth. I'm pretty much a loner and although this is unhealthy as fuck, he's my only real friend.

173,c9z41f,throwagay915,"Ex [18M] matched with me [21M] on Tinder, we had some small talk, then he ghosted me","Hi,

I'm really confused about this whole situation. My ex and I met on Grindr and originally were meant to just be FWBs but we had a ton in common and were really similar people, so we kinda started dating without actually saying we were dating. He broke it off after a bit over 3 months and our friendship slowly died to the point where he would leave me on read, even if we hadn't talked in weeks. Eventually I got tired of being disrespected like that so I deleted him from snap and haven't talked to nor seen him since except for one time at the gym.

It's been about 7 months since we broke up and 4 since we last talked, and the past 2 months or so I noticed he was searching for me on LinkedIn, since he works at a small company and it said that someone from that company had searched for me for 6 or 7 weeks straight. Then this past week after I got back from vacation, I matched with him on Tinder. We said our heys and did some bullshit small talk like how've you been over the course of a few days, but then after that I told him to add me on snap if he wants to talk. He didn't respond for 3 days, during which time I saw him at the gym again where he just kinda awkwardly avoided eye contact when we passed by each other. I sent him a message that basically said I don't know why he swiped right if he didn't want to talk and that I want to patch things up between us, and to reach out to me when he's ready to. He hasn't responded.

Deep down I still care for him a lot and would like to be with him again. I thought I was past that after we broke up since I thought there was never a chance, but now this has me questioning all of that and has made my feelings for him resurface. I know now that the best option is just for me to wait for him to reach out to me, if he ever does, but now I'm going to be holding out hope that it works out even if there's realistically a small chance that anything will happen again. Why would he match with me and then get wet feet like that? Thanks for reading, I've been really torn up about this.

174,ca1d5f,buttercupandhoney,How can I make it obvious to a guy that I’m interested in him without telling him outright?,"There’s this guy in my class that I have a crush on. This crush is kind of complicated... because I could think of a few reasons he wouldn’t like me.

1) He’s Mormon. I’ve heard that Mormons are allowed to date outside of their religion, but it’s not encouraged. He opted out of missionary work and hasn’t expressed any interest in doing it in the future, so I’m guessing he’s not crazy religious.
2) He’s white and I’m not. I doubt he’s racist because all of his friends in class are black and brown + he went to a 70% non-white HS + he lives in a diverse neighbourhood - BUT that doesn’t necessarily mean he’s into IR dating. 
3) I’m in my early 20s and I’ve never had a boyfriend. I don’t know what it is about me that turns guys away. I try to flirt, but they all seem to like me as a friend at most. I am a confident person, but it really does hurt your self esteem when a girl who has a shitty personality or is extremely ugly by societies standards is able to get a boyfriend and you can’t. 

I want to make it obvious to this guy that I like him. We don’t really talk in class. I’ve tried inviting him to our study groups, but he prefers to study alone, so he’ll always go home right after class. I started to take the train with him since we live near each other. We would always sit together and talk. He would tell me stories about things that have happened to him and all that. Whenever I would lean into him, he would never pull away (which is good, right?), but that’s as far as things would go with us.",2019-07-07 01:30:33,9,2,dating_advice

179,ca0wx7,Joka13,"Objective perspective on dating but not being,, official""","Hi guys :)

I wanted to ask for advice in order to get an objective perspective. Maybe it'll help if I read back what I wrote and get clarity that way, or maybe some of you could help me clear things up :)

I (F25) have been seeing a guy (M22) for 9 months. At the start of  us dating I asked him what he is looking for right now, generally. I was pretty open to either be fuck buddies or to have a relationship, but I wanted a clear agreement between us regarding those things. He told me that he wants to see where this goes, and if it would become a relationship or not. After couple of months I asked if we are seeing other people or not. He said nah, he is over that crap, and is not seeing someone else, not his thing anymore (excuse you, Casanova) . No problem, no clear answer on both of those issues, but it was fine with me. I let it slide. 

We proceeded to see eachother on a regular basis, 99% of the time at my place, sometimes we would just talk about our lives without having sex when we saw eachother, sometimes we would have sex and only focus on that. Now, I noticed that I started caring for the guy. I want to protect myself as I am a very emotional person, and don't want to invest myself too much without having any certainty. I notice he cares, but doesn't show it very much, since he is different than me, rationality is his second name. 

How do you guys see this issue from an objective standpoint?

Reading back, to me, it looks like he is keeping his options open in case something,, better"" comes along and is making sure I can't say anything since we were never official. Sound like another,, he ain't that into you"" situation.",2019-07-07 00:42:08,2,2,dating_advice

We cuddled as we watched the fireworks and would give each other playful kisses on the hands and cheek.  I could tell she wanted me to kiss her throughout the night, but I was emotionally unavailable. But the whole time I was thinking, man, this is the girl I should have met in high school a long time ago, not now. Now I’m 2 years removed from high school, and after this date I had trouble coming to terms with it. She obviously was interested in me, but I don’t even know how to jump into something I’ve never had any experience with before. With a heavy heart I turned her down for a second date. And to be honest during the date another reason why I was emotionally unavailable was that I was thinking about another girl, and it prevented me from feeling a strong connection with this one. It’s just complicated man, if I wasn’t hung up on the other girl and I had healthy relationships in the past, things would work out with this girl one hundred percent.

But today my best friend referred to him as my boyfriend and I just felt him tense up next to me and immediately freak out. Of course my best friend didn’t notice this, but I did because helloooooo, after six months of dating someone and seeing them constantly, you start to pick up on their reactions and moods. It’s not just about the titles. It’s more about things that come with the title, like the fact that he felt uncomfortable with me posting the first nice picture we were able to get together on my Instagram, so much so that I started to feel uncomfortable and guilty and decided to take it down. But how can you introduce me to your parents and do milestone relationship things with me but something as trivial like posting a picture of us or calling you my boyfriend is too much? 

Yes. I’ve talked to him about it multiple times but he just says that it’s not a big deal.  Like i said before, I tried being patient but I can’t take it anymore. I feel like it’s his way of keeping me at arms length but just close enough for when he needs someone and I can’t stand it anymore. I’ve always felt like I always give give give in all my friendships and relationships and I’m tired of being the one who puts an effort.

Back in grade 12 when I moved schools I thought this one girl Laura was really attractive. I never really spoke to her initially but we became good friends throughout the year. We hung out a lot and talked on the phone a lot too. I never really had a crush on her. After grade 12 she took another half year in school and I went to college. As time went on we talked less and less but remained good friends. Once she had gotten a new boyfriend naturally she was spending more time with him and less and less with me which was OK. However, she kept blowing me off and it came to where she blew off my birthday which was the breaking point for me. When she tried making plans to hangout I kind of her dry texted her and gave no interest. We stopped talking. About a year later I texted if she wanted to hangout which she happily agreed. Found out she was single and some feelings for her came back. I asked her out a week later and she said she didn’t feel the same and she was too busy and all at the time due to college.

TL;DR: this great guy I like opened up to me within two weeks of meeting him and shows a lot of interest in me, but am I mistaking his trust as romantic interest?

Around two weeks ago I (F16) met this great guy (M16)(let’s call him J) through a friend who I could really be myself with, who invited me into the Discord group. I found the guys really funny and cool to talk to so I stayed on the call. I told J he should play imsg games with me so he said yeah sure and I gave him my number.

  Later I was invited to play badminton with J and the other guys in the group on Fridays. It was actually really fun and we even had free time before going into the gym to play card games. Me and him start talking more on text and on call after that.

Then it became the little things he did to make me happy, I couldn’t fall asleep so he tried playing relaxing music for me. His sleep schedule is absolutely garbage and I told him he had to try and fix it, so he started improving it. I played smash against him and it was like he didn’t want it to end whether I won or lost he would always ask for a rematch. I’m really good at the card game we were playing (this game requires a lot of thinking and backstabbing other players) he keeps looking at my cards to tease me and I joke at him to stop, be nice! And surprisingly he does. He even tells his friend to move so he can sit next to me.

Things are good and then he opens up to me about his personal problems. I level with him because my problems are really similar to his and we have long talks about them, enjoying the comfort of relating to someone else. He tells me that only me and the friend that introduced us know about what goes on at home and that he’s happy that our friend introduced him to me in the first place. 

My other friends say he sounds like a great guy although I shouldn’t rush into things, but should I even pursue this crush if he’s already put me in the friend zone?

Super confused/worried,"First things first, I am on birth control (the implant in the arm- very reliable). My boyfriend has always been a huge fan of finishing inside me. The first couple times we had sex, I always made him pull out (because this is what I’ve done with my previous relationships), but he would occasionally ask permission to finish inside but I would say no. A month later, we go on vacation, and I noticed he packed condoms in his luggage. I was very confused because we never use condoms. I asked him why did he pack it and he said so that he could finish inside the condom while still inside. I felt bad because he would rather have condom sex if it means he could release that way. He also believes pulling out during sex is basically just a more complicated form of masturbation because in the end, he still had to jerk off. So during the trip, I allowed him to finish inside. And it has been that way for the last 5 months, which he seemed to thoroughly enjoy (creampies are his kink). About 2 weeks ago, we have drunk sex and he pulls out. I ask why and he said he was curious how far it could shoot on my back. Okay whatever. The next morning, he pulls out again. I ask why. He said it’s just easier and that way I don’t have to worry about it dripping out. Okay, now I’m a bit suspicious. The next week, we see each other again. He proceeds to do the same thing. And the next morning, pulls out again. I ask him why is he doing that because I know how much he likes to finish inside. I ask if he doesn’t trust me and I offer to show him the birth control implanted in my arm, and he said it’s not that. He says he’s been pulling out so that he doesn’t have to add another thing to worry about and the stress can be easily alleviated by doing this....

When I was in dating sights I didn’t put my height, and several women commented when we met that I’m too short, and they wouldn’t have met me if they knew. I put my height on my profiles and I immediately stopped getting matches. 

People on Reddit keep telling me it’s not a big deal, but my experiences are telling me otherwise. They say short people find matches, and that I just haven’t met someone who doesn’t care. But it’s obvious to me that it does matter. I’ve literally not met someone willing to date me because of my height.

I’m just so disenfranchised with the whole thing. I can’t get dates because of my height, and I dint think I will. Should I just throw in the towel?",2019-07-07 02:41:31,13,1,dating_advice

Here is the thing, I’ve been seeing this guy for about 2 months now and he texts me everyday. We literally talk everyday and we are cute with each other (pet names and etc...)
But I’m a little confused.
I don’t know, I feel like he doesn’t want to see me or doesn’t want hard enough,
Yes, we see each other every weekend, however, last week he canceled on me because he was sick (had a fever).
And this weekend he says he is still recovering but he was good enough to go on a bike ride yesterday. 
How can you be sick and still be active AND TELL ME about it lol. I am used to more passionate guys that want to see me no matter what. 
Maybe he’s just not that into me? How should I go forward?

I met this girl on okCupid last Thursday we talked a bit and hit it off and decided to go to a convention together that weekend.

Being demi I usually never feel the way I feel about her after a first date, but she has been dominating my thoughts all week.

Anyway, we are both more on the quiet and reserved side, but we had fun together on Saturday and made plans to go the next day and also meet up on the following Tuesday.

Sunday she cancelled on me since she wasn't feeling well, but we kept texting thru out the day and plans for Tuesday where still on.

We went on the other date on Tuesday and things where still going well. It was a short date but we hugged for a while after and she said we have to go again soon.

So this is where I need advice. Since Sunday it has pretty much always been me who initiated our txt conversations. We where also supposed to go on another date today, but she cancelled 2 hrs before the time came.

I am not sure if I should just back off at this point and wait for her to contact me or call her tell her I like her and ask to make things clear ?",2019-07-06 22:33:57,5,2,dating_advice
213,ca1r7s,RiseofdaOatmeal,Moving away from online dating to meeting people irl,"I've been active on the online dating scene for quite a while now, and I'm really losing my mind to be frank. I want to move to meeting people outside of the digital realm.

My biggest problem is that I have no network. I know people who say ""I have no friends"" usually at least have a hand full, but ever since I graduated I had to push away all the people I went to school with. All of my truly close friends are online and all over the world.

My next issue is that I have no idea when it's an acceptable time to ask for a girl's contact info, or how much of a relationship I should have with them prior. For example: I had a crush on this girl at a gas station I went to on a regular basis. She was really nice to me and would often stop and ask me how I was doing. I got so wrapped up in my paranoia that I couldn't tell if she was just being nice because it's her job or if I made a good impression with her. In the end I moved on the other side of town so I never see her anymore.

I'm socially awkward to the point that I'm afraid to embarrass a person at their place of work if it turns out they're just doing their job. So when is it okay to ask someone for their contact info? Under what circumstances is the most respectful time to do so?",2019-07-07 02:13:19,3,1,dating_advice
214,ca1nbp,SaintSexburga,Where to meet singles under 30 in Boston?,"I (22f) have been single my entire life. I have talked/gone out with boys for a couple months at a time but never experienced anything long term.

My story is not unlike the others: I tried tinder and the usual dating apps but failed. There was a point in which I was going on a couple dates a week. Every boy gives me the usual crap: ""its me, not you, not ready for commitment, blah blah blah blah"". That or I truly do not feel a connection with them. 

I'm honestly getting really dejected. While I know I'm not stunningly beautiful, I would not consider myself unattractive either.

216,c9v777,DullLight,Crushing on close friend,"Been friends with this girl about 1.5 year and a half now but recently as weve been getting closer, ive been developing stronger feelings for her. Shes generally a flirty/forward/physical person so it makes things a bit more difficult to read. Shes also a home body which also makes it difficult to hang out one on on as she never does anything social and is a main reason why I dont want to just ask her out directly.

My gut feeling says there is some interest there on her part but very wavering and teeter tottering if that makes sense. I tend to get jealous/possessive even though were only friends but ive been trying to keep it in check and remind myself that its irrational to feel this way buts its been hard because she of how flirty and friendly she is ith people and this drives me nuts when she does things in front of me. 

like shell say people are 'cute' or 'sweet' (regardless of gender but I just take it more personally when its about a guy). And recently we were texting and she texted me ""dudes name texted me awww lol"" after a party me and that dude were at (that she didnt come to). Which i dont know why she would just tell me that? It just seems out of place and weird to me. And i cant tell if shes doing it to play games or what. 

Ive been thinking of either asking her friend for advice bout her or just sending her a text saying like ""As weve been getting closer, ive been kinda crushing on you lately and wanted to see where your headspace is at. I really value you as a friend so Im trying to be more open and communicative with you and just wanted to see where your headspace is at""

220,c9xbxf,DisposableAct19,How to reconnect with someone (19F) that I (19M) missed my shot with?,"I (19M) have been thinking a lot recently about someone (19F, let’s call her Ann) who I missed my chance with a while back, who I’m still friends with and talk to/see occasionally. Here’s some backstory.

Through high school, I was good friends with Ann, we would hang out a lot in groups but never really alone, and a lot of people actually did think we should be together, but neither made a move. I’ve been told that she did like me before, but at the time I stopped liking her as if was in a relationship with someone else. Hindsight is 20/20 and that relationship was a waste as it didn’t last long and I could’ve gone with Ann instead. But we still were friends, I was just too stupid to make a move. We even went to multiple school dances together, including proms, but for some reason which I regret I never made a move. Maybe I was too nervous or unsure but I don’t really remember. Anyways, after coming back from college for the summer, I’ve wanted to see her again but haven’t gotten the chance to. I’ve tried to invite her somewhere twice so far and both times she’s been busy (which might sound like an excuse from her but she legitimately was) and I don’t want to sound desperate by asking again and again. Not only that, but I’m more concerned that I’ll never have a chance with her again and I’m too late to realize that I missed the perfect opportunity. I obviously don’t expect her to still like me or anything, but we’re still friends at least and I was wondering what the best way to go about this is. Is there a way for me to start building my friendship with her to that point again, or is it a lost cause?

Also it’s probably important to mention that I know she’s single atm and my/her friends want to set me up with her which might be a good sign since her friends would probably know if she’s still into me or not",2019-07-06 19:07:54,3,3,dating_advice
221,c9xame,stellagkite,Advice for keeping things casual when you actually like the person,"Short backstory: I got out of an emotionally abusive relationship about 6 months ago, and have been focusing on building my personal foundation back up since. 
 
I’ve started casually dating, and I think it’s the best thing for me right now. Relationships are a lot of work, and I just don’t think I can give anyone the proper love/attention right now. 

Casual dating has been easy for the most part, but mainly because the most of the guys I’ve been seeing clearly aren’t “the one”. They are all great guys, but I know that there is no future with them. And this has been openly communicated. 

However, I recently met a guy who I actually really like. Maybe a little too much.  I’m starting to catch feelings, and it’s worrying me.  I know I’m not ready for a relationship, but I think it might be hard for me to keep things “casual” with this one.  I’m not sure what to do.  It doesn’t seem like he’s looking for a serious relationship either, but I’m an emotional gal and worried that I’ll fall in love.  Do I let him go?

My friend (let’s call him J) and I have known each other for over ten years. I used to have the biggest crush on him when we were in middle school, but never said anything. I even decided if J and I were only going to ever be friends, that’s fine because I’m happy to just know him. We stayed friends after high school and started spending more time together with our whole friend group after graduation. It’s not like we never hang out alone though. Over the past 6-8 months we’ve hung out at least every other day. We have a standing hang on Saturday’s for a card game and drinks night. I often come with him to his band practice or one of their shows. 

Every time we go out together we eventually get asked “So how long have you guys been dating” and usually we give the exaggerated “s/he’s like my brother/sister gross” response. Recently, J’s cousin has been making a big deal about us, saying or even shouting that J and I would be great together and we should just give it a shot. 

We started hooking up a few weeks ago and we have a great time together. But, we haven’t really had a conversation about what it means. The chemistry and compatibility are all there, although I feel awkward when trying to flirt with him. And we don’t kiss or anything around our friends.

I want to ask him to a movie or dinner or something but I’ve never really asked someone on a date before. I also haven’t been on a date in a while. And he’s like my best friend. I don’t want to make things awkward or force anything. 

Should I just let things continue naturally as they are or should I try to more clearly define the relationship?

I was dating this girl for about 2.5 months and things were going great, I was starting to really like her. She seemed to be into me and was even asking me if my parents liked her and everything like that. Then all of a sudden she texted me and said she wasn't ready for a serious relationship. Her reasoning was that she was very busy with graduation, taking boards, starting a new job, and moving all in the span of a month or so. I just took this as a nicer way for her to say that she wasn't into me, so I accepted this and planned to move on. 

However, she started to snapchat and text me only a few days after this. Nothing serious, just friendly stuff. We've been snapchatting and texting every day for about 2 months since she said she wasn't ready for a relationship, but we haven't hung out since. About two weeks ago, she mentioned to me that her ex moved back in town and wanted to get back with her. She told me that she thinks he sucks and doesn't want to get back with him, but she still cares about him. With her ex back in the picture, I really want to lay it on the line and let her know how I feel about her and see if she wants to start hanging out again - but i'm afraid that she'll just say she isn't ready since its only been a few months. I'm really into this girl still and am just so confused because i can't tell if she is still leaving the door open for me or if she's just talking to me because she likes the attention.

235,c9t460,pugsnhugs93,My coworker(23M) is being weird and it’s confusing me(24F),"

Ok so, this boy got me fucked up. 

I have a secret crush on my coworker. I low key think he likes me too. But he’s so strange around me. 

These are the mixed signals he keeps giving me:


-He’s super outgoing with his other coworkers. He has a deep voice, he’s loud and he jokes around with them. But with me, he’s super quiet and closed off. When he talks to me, his voice is low and he’s serious. 

-If all of us are in a group, he would be quiet and stand offish. But when I’m gone, he’s outgoing again.

-He will start talking to me, but once I talk back, he gets quiet and gives me one word answers. 

-He always parks his car next to me.

-Stares at me CONSTANTLY. When I catch him, he looks down and away.

-He says my name a lot when we talk(it turns me on how he says my name, holy shit). 

-He’s super helpful. Whenever I ask a question, no matter who I ask it to, he always answers it first. 

-He comes to my defense if a coworker says something inappropriate to me. 

-He always agrees and sympathizes with me if I have an issue.

-If I’m close by and he’s having a conversation with someone, he will include me in it by referencing my name or something. 


This is why I’m confused

-One day we will be talking a lot to each other, the next day, he avoids and ignores me.

-If it’s just the two of us in a room, he will go far away from me and fidget with his phone. I say fidget because I saw him on it a couple of times. All he’s doing is scrolling through random shit on Facebook or Twitter or Spotify. His hand never stops moving.

-Once I got out of my car and went to the front doors for our manager to let us in. He got out of his car too and followed me to the door. He was already at the building before I got there, but chose to come out once I arrived. Yet, all he did was stand away from me and fidget with is phone. 

-He’s looking at the ground when I pass by him. 

-When I smile and say hi, he nods his head and looks down. 


When I’m around him, it’s like he’s scared or anxious. I try talking to him, but I’m scared too. I’m super shy and get anxiety around him. I’m overcoming it. I’m just trying to understand this guy and why does he act like this. Any helpful tips and advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

She is in her late twenties (possibly early thirties?) and I am 21. She's still living with parents just like me so we're still sort of at the same ''life stage''.

The thing is that when I was getting off the train I asked if she had instagram. She said ''No, but I do have facebook''. My immediate thought was that she had no reason to tell me that. If she had no interest she would simply have said ''no, sorry''. She was also perfectly happy for us to add each other. From experience if someone isn't too interested they'd say something like ''I don't feel comfortable adding people I don't know'' which is perfectly understandable of course. The conversation was so good that even when I stood up to get off the train at my stop, we ended up having another chat so I had to sprint off the train before the doors closed. I asked if I could message her on facebook and she said sure.

See the thing is she is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful. Way out of my league. While I prefer older women, I understand that a lot of older women will not give a younger man a chance. Which is their choice of course but it would be another problem.

OTOH I chatted to a few (girl) friends of mine and they said they wouldn't have acted the way she did if they weren't interested. They said that if a guy who they weren't into asked if they had instagram, they wouldn't have given him another means of talking to her. The problem is she was a really bubbly person so for all I know she could just be really kind and outgoing and happy to friend any random she meets on facebook. Considering that we were in a train in public she may also have felt uncomfortable humiliating me by saying no (on that point, I made a point not to ask her until I was leaving the train, so that way if she said no and felt uncomfortable she would never have to see me again).

I want to message her tomorrow but I'm scared to take that leap of faith. My life has seen a lot of disappointment recently, not just relating to girls but I also lost out on my dream job recently in spite of doing everything right and being formally offered said job. I can't help but wonder if disappointment is the default setting and that things just aren't going to work out. I know I have ''nothing to lose'' or whatever but all that failure, rejection and disappointment starts to hurt after a while.

239,c9umi7,Meme_Master_Woo,Need help reading these SIGNALS,"I’m having a lot of problems reading signals and signs from women around the ages of 19-20. 

So I met this one girl on my college campus and she’s only staying for a month. She’s cute so I talked to her. My interactions consisted of talking at night holding hands at 3 a.m., her being playful by hugging me from behind and squeezing my nose, and her laying in bed with me and sleeping (no sex, or even kissing). I thought these were clear signs of interest but she HAS A BOYFRIEND who is currently on vacation. So I wonder if these signs are just friendly signs or she wants attention or if she is actually interested in me? 

For another instance, I met this one girl from my friend group and our friends took a vacation to a lake house. The drive was 3 hours long, but before it, she told me that she wanted to sit next to me. During the entire car ride, my arm was wrapped around her and she was sleeping on my shoulder. After having fun at the lake, I laid on a king size bed, not alone, but she squeezes in and lays on my chest and we went to sleep. But it’s turns out SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND. So I’m really fucking confused right now! Is this just friendly signs? Are girls like this desperate for attention? Or are girls like this, actually like me?

P.S. You guys are probably going to say that I should have kissed them or whatever, but I actually have morals.",2019-07-06 15:11:51,2,3,dating_advice

We got to know each other, and when he started really hitting on me, I pulled back because I realized I wasn’t ready for anything serious. I told him how I felt about it all, and he seemed understanding. Problem is that he keeps writing me every night, and seems to be hoping for something as soon as I’m “ready”. At the time when I told him how I felt, I still had a crush on him. But after I’ve gotten to know him further I’ve realized that I’m not interested in him at all. How do I tell him that I’m not interested? Or am I just misunderstanding an attempt at a friendship?

Unfortunately, she was a rebound from my first relationship. After that I realized I needed to improve myself a lot before I pursued anything else. I started going to the gym a lot more frequently and have since put on a healthy amount of weight and I now feel great physically. I also expanded my social circle by a lot and have made new friends (guys and girls) without the intent of dating anyone.

It’s now been 1 1/2 years since my last relationship and I’m ready to put myself back out there. My question is how. I’ve tried Tinder and Bumble for a bit and got 2 dates but they ended up being pretty bad dates. I don’t like the dynamic of online dating and feel it is very artificial so I deleted the apps. Can’t get into bars yet and clubs are fun but you can’t really talk to anyone in there over the pounding music.

So how should I go about putting myself out there in hopes of finding a potential partner?

At that point I think I blushed a little (lol I've never been actively flirting or being flirted with so) but then I quickly gathered myself, snapped back a finger gun and raised my eyebrows in a ""Yeah I am looking at you, mannn"" way.

Worth pursuing?,"So I've been interested in a girl for awhile now, but until recently is hasn't really been possible for us to date for some different reasons. We've been super good friends for around 2 years now, and we have a ton in common. We share a sense of humor and a lot of interests and ideas. We started chatting like potential romantic partners do a few weeks ago off and on and our conversations have gone REALLY well. They last a long time and she seems to send a lot of flirty texts. For example, we currently live a little far away and she said, ""You better hurry your way up here ;)"". And when talking about one of her hobbies she said ""I guess I'll have to teach you how someday ;)"". Now I was pretty excited as these seemed like some pretty clear signs to me.

BUT, unfortunately there are some mixed signals - at least how I read them. First, she never texts first. She's engaging in the conversations when we have them but I can't help but feel like maybe she's just being nice? But if so why is she seemingly flirting? Second, when I had the opportunity to visit her last week we went out on a sort-of date. It was nothing formal but we spent some time together alone. We chatted a lot about many different things. But in that conversation she started talking about the guys she had dated previously. This seemed like a weird thing to be talking about with someone who you're interested in? 

So basically I'm trying to decide what all these signals mean. Does she just see me as a close friend? Or is there something more to it? Is she just flirty in general? I'm not sure. Is it worth it to pursue this further?",2019-07-06 17:43:24,3,1,dating_advice

This is partly because I read people *really* well in person, but not so much online at least not on apps, so I like to give them a shot.

So I've been talking to this girl for a while, and I finally met up with her earlier this week and now we're going on a date next week. We live in the same country, but in different cities (1h plane ride). The positive is that all my family is in her city and I'm moving back there once I finish my studies in a year and a half. I also do visit quite often.

At the same time, I know the distance will be painful if this does develop into a full-blown relationship. I would like to be somewhat prepared for this.

 I would love to hear about some experiences from someone who has been or is currently in the same situation if possible.

267,c9oz7j,wallflowerbouquet,Awkwardness around Sexual Tension,"So, I (21F) always seem to get awkward when a guy brings up something that creates sexual tension between us. I went on a date yesterday with a really nice guy (23M). He brought up something about kissing and how it can take a bit to find a rhythm with someone new. I joked around with him about that for a little and then things got silent and there was a lot of sexual tension. So of course, I switched the subject since I had no idea where to go from there. What can I do or say in the future in situations like this? How do I not back out of these sexual tension situations awkwardly?

271,c9tdb8,tjcjrusa,Compliments,"When is it appropriate to compliment a strangers t-shirt while in public? Particularly band t-shirts, often in public I've noticed that they are worn as fashion statements rather than being a fan of the music. It seems like an odd attempt at fitting in with counter-culture and is an immediate turn off if the receiving party is claims ""it's just a shirt."" This happens at concerts or record stores too and it's pretty frustrating. As the receiving party it's off-putting when someone compliments a shirt; I often respond with ""Nice, are you a fan? I saw them live a couple of times"" or ""oh yeah this is my buddies band, are they mutual friends of ours?"" or whatever else along those lines. It's really off putting when someone just likes the design and catches me off guard and I feel like I come off as really pretentious.  


What am I doing wrong? Is just a simple ""hey thanks *que smile*"" and an Irish goodbye more appropriate? I avoid wearing t-shirts of an artist or film/ series I can't discuss.",2019-07-06 13:03:52,4,1,dating_advice
272,c9py83,JustADuDuDude,Should I ask out a friend from my childhood?,"If it matters, I'm 17 in high school. The friend from my childhood is 19 in college. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, as a kid, I was new to the neighborhood, and she was super kind and friendly to me, and I met up with her in the elementary school as well. She was taller and 2 years older than me, but super sweet.

&amp;#x200B;

Even as a kid I could tell she was objectively super pretty. Slim, blonde hair, blue eyes, smooth pale skin, etc. But back then I didn't feel attraction to girls in ""that"" kind of way. So as I saw it, she was just a boy, just prettier and nicer. She played a lot of sports with me and was super athletic, too, and we'd eat ice cream afterwards. 

&amp;#x200B;

But over time stuff happened and she moved...though we still kept in touch through email and phone. And relatively recently, she moved back to the area. I was excited, but also nervous. 

&amp;#x200B;

A part of me was hoping she'd be cute as a kid but ugly as an adult, but nope...she pretty much only got much, much sexier. And being who I am now, I kind of struggle treating pretty girls the same way I treat my guy friends. Especially since I've developed an attraction to legs, and I live somewhere hot where everyone wears shorts, and so I can't really look down or else I'll be too distracted. 

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as she saw me, she hugged me tightly, and said how small I was as a kid when she hugged me, but now I'm so huge and she's the tiny one. 

&amp;#x200B;

And from there...we pretty much just hung out normally. Though it's been a very long time since I've hung out with a female friend outside of school. We walked, we jogged, we ate out, we played sports, we played video games, etc...it's been a great time, really. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I just can't get over how attracted I am to her. And not just that, she has a great personality, too. Cracking jokes often but also being sensitive about my feelings, and giving me great advice about what to do in college, since she's already there. 

&amp;#x200B;

There have been a few awkward but kind of cute moments between us, for the lack of a better way to describe it. 

&amp;#x200B;

In general she doesn't mind physical contact, and often leans on me, but after jogging for a bit, we were both tired and exhausted and just sort of slammed ourselves down on a bench. And from there, since we sat in close proximity, somehow my hand ended up on her bare thigh. She didn't notice the very second but noticed, and blushed a little bit, I pulled my hand away and told her sorry, she seemed to blush a little redder and said, no no no, it's okay. 

&amp;#x200B;

Or another moment, when we were at a restaurant, from under the table our bare knees ended up touching...but neither of us moved away. I could notice her face flush to a bright pink color for a few seconds, though we just continued our conversation normally. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm not gonna go further about that, as I myself rereading the aforementioned examples cringe at how much of a pervert I sound, but there were lots of little moments like that. Though about the blushing part, to be fair, she has really fair skin and we live somewhere hot, so maybe the blushing wasn't necessarily because of me. Still, under the table she could've moved her leg away from mine but didn't, and she could've slapped away my hand from her thigh but instead was sweet about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

And overall...not gonna lie, I like her, but I'm afraid asking out a childhood friend like this might be taboo, and I'm concerned I may be a creepy guy, not suitable for dating. I'm not super overweight or anti-social or anything, but I've never been in a relationship in my life, and I kind of feel she might be too good for me. I mean come on, what kind of person except an obvious virgin thinks so much about legs just casually touching?",2019-07-06 05:26:52,9,3,dating_advice
273,c9ot84,thoughtsofkimlan,Am I crazy?,"Some quick background info before the real question hits... I (20F) recently started a summer internship at a law firm in New York. I’ve only been in one serious relationship that ended pretty horribly, so I’ve been very cautious with dating. I’m on tinder and bumble, but I haven’t gotten anything serious from them.  I’ve been rejected by a lot of guys for my race or my weight or for any number of things which has taken its toll on my confidence. I love myself but I find it hard to believe that anyone else would. 

Back to the internship. There’s a tech support employee (24M) who I met the first day on the job. He helped me get my desk set up, and we immediately hit it off talking about playing the guitar (I’m minoring in music at school, so I was really surprised by his extensive knowledge). There are about five other employees/interns in our age group (20-25) and we decided to start an iMessage group chat. I occasionally respond with gifs or with basic message reactions, but nothing too deep. I’m not from New York originally and my university is in South Carolina, so I don’t expect to stay close with them. 

The tech support guy (we’ll call him Jack) texted me away from the group chat about two weeks ago, and we’ve been texting on and off since then. From the moment I wake up to the minute I shut my eyes we’re texting about any and everything, even at work. He even makes a point of coming by my very far and out of the way cubicle to chat with me or bring me snacks from the kitchen. We’ve gone to lunch together before, without our other coworkers, and I really enjoy spending time with him. 

We’ve talked about a lot of things, and I find him very interesting. Jack is an attractive guy, not my usual type, but I like him. He’s sweet, funny, and a little goofy. He isn’t in school at all and doesn’t have a degree, but he makes quite a but working at the firm. He’s invited me out for drinks once or twice, but I’ve declined because I’m not old enough and even if I was I’d be too shy to meet up with him alone. But I have been dropping hints, and flirting (even though I’m awful at it).

The problem is, Jack is becoming increasingly close with another intern (21F, we’ll call her Laura). She’s a truly beautiful girl, think and fair (skin tone) with pretty hair. Basically the visual opposite of me. A lot of the guys we work with have remarked about her looks. She is such a sweet girl and I actually enjoy being her friend as well. But lately I’ve seen her alone with Jack in his office, and I’ve seen them leave the office twice together in her car. 

Laura and I talked and she told me blatantly that she isn’t interested in Jack and that they weren’t together, but I’ve seen his name pop up on her screen more than once (we work closely on a lot of things, we’re in the same department). Laura doesn’t seem like the type to lie, but I see the way Jack looks at her and it makes me feel like a fool. He’s even mentioned to me once or twice how pretty she is. Not that it matters, but he’s never even acknowledged the way I look. 

I’m starting to think that Jack’s either really nice to me because he’s a nice person, or that he’s no longer interested in me because I’ve been hesitant. The third option is that he’s just being nice to me because he wants to be my friend, and that he and Laura have secretly begun a relationship. (This doesn’t bother me at all, they would make a cute couple and I’d get over it since like I said, I might not see either of them after this summer.)

Please tell me if I’m being paranoid. I really tried to be as objective as possible (LOL). I’m going to a party that Jack will be at this weekend, and I’d like to make a move. Maybe you all can give me some tips before I potentially make a fool out of myself.",2019-07-06 03:07:54,6,5,dating_advice
274,c9rjoh,HiberLupus,S.O.S! Just got a girls number after a year of being single and I have no idea what to do.,"So a bit of background and to make this more on the brief side; I started dating someone in high school and we stayed together for 6 years before she broke up with me. I've been trying to dip my toes in the dating scene with Tinder/OkCupid for the past year with little to no success (Only ever met up with one in person and it was terrible. She was just there for a free meal) Because I started dating someone in high school I have had next to no experience in dating in my adult life (I am 24). I'm hoping that some of you might be able to give me advice on how to move forward as this woman seems quite interesting and I'd like to not fuck this up right away.  


The situation:  
I'm a bartender working my way though college and the girl (We'll call her Jane from here on) came in with two of her other friends for some food and drink. We all kicked it off well enough cracking jokes as I had them sample a couple of fun beers while they tried to decide on what to get. Eventually they were setup with their drinks and chatting with each other and they would include me in the conversation/joke when I would check up on them. A couple of times while helping others around the bar or doing some side work I thought I caught Jane looking at me a time or two (Honestly might have just been my imagination). Jane ran a tab while her friends paid cash as they drank so when they went out to get to the car she came to settle her tab with me. I cashed her out and for the first time in my life asked someone for their number.   
""Hey I've never really done this before and I hope it's not too weird but could I get your number?"" Is more or less what I said. She thought it out for a few seconds before agreeing saying she's never really given it out like that before either and wrote it on the check. We shared an awkward laugh and said goodbye.  


What I need help with:  
One thing came to mind right after we said our goodbyes; I know her name (From her ID and credit card) and I have her number but I never actually told her my name in return so I feel a bit weird about that.  
Beyond that I honestly just need an idea of where to go from here. I know there's an old 'rule' of waiting a couple of days before texting (idk if that's still a thing or not).  
Do I wait to text her? Do I try and carry a conversation through text or should I go straight for getting her out for drinks or something?   
If I start a conversation then how and about what!?! How do you start conversations when you know next to nothing about a person?  
I honestly don't even know if she gave me her real number!  
It might all just be nerves and I'm freaking out because I've been out of the game (Or never even really played till now) but honestly any advice would be awesome.  


P.S. I'm sorry if this post is a mess. I'm a long time reddit user but this is only my second only post and I'm not in the most calm of states at the moment.",2019-07-06 08:59:24,3,2,dating_advice

I'm 31 and single.  Haven't been in many relationships, but have been single for the past 4 years and trying to find a new girlfriend.  I have dated a bit the past few years, but did not meet people who were the right match for me.

I am introverted, and I don't think I am bad-looking but I think women have unreasonable standards.  I'm tired of lowering my own standards and still have hope that I can meet an attractive, healthy, smart, funny woman without children who is into the same things as me and is mutually interested in me.

I refuse to do online dating or use dating apps again, since I have had bad luck with that for years.  I want to meet someone in person.  But I am worried that nobody is willing to get to know me as a person anymore, and that I can't meet anyone in today's world.  I feel like I get rejected too soon.

281,c9f7ct,ldamien65,How can I stop being so co-dependant in relationships?,"Hi, 

For some context, I’m an 18 year old college student. I’ve only been in one serious relationship which was extremely codependent up until the end. I was borderline obsessed with this girl. We would see each other every single day. I’d stay up till 3-4 am each night with her and function off of 3 hours of sleep the next day. I’d attend my lectures, complete any assignments and repeat the process day in, day out. If she were to text me during a lecture, I’d then spend the entire time texting her and hardly pay any attention in class. I would’ve went to any length for this girl back in the day but unfortunately, it ended in a pretty brutal manner. 

 I then took a seven month hiatus and although I was suffering for the first few months, I managed to improve many aspects of my life. I picked up gymming again, began excelling in school instead of just being an average student and just overall was a lot more productive. I still went on a few dates, had casual sex from time to time but none of the girls really caught my attention or perhaps I still wasn’t over my previous relationship. 

I recently began dating this new girl I met through mutual friends and see myself falling into the same patterns of behavior. I’m having a hard time focusing on whatever tasks I have to fulfil. I want to spend every waking moment with her but obviously, that isn’t viable nor is it healthy. I’ve only known this girl for a few weeks and things are escalating quite quickly in terms of seriousness. I speculate she also has a tendency to actively encourage enmeshment in relationships and that may be why I’m falling so hard for her. It seems that I subconsciously detect when certain women share the same traits as I do and could potentially fulfil my toxic needs. 

I want to have a sense of balance in my life while having a partner but I just can’t seem to do it in a healthy manner. I feel like my life shouldn’t revolve around this one individual but I just don’t understand why I keep making them the center of everything. My emotional well-being is dependant on how this person responds to me and the state of our relationship and I don’t want it to have this much of an impact on my life.

291,c9pvok,Meloxian,"I want to ask my co-worker to hang out, I’m pretty sure she’s into me, what do you think I should do?","I M19 like this girl F19 at my work (an entry level job so I’m not too worried about the “don’t shit where you eat rule”) and I think she’s really attractive, both in looks and behavior. 

Backstory: she usually works a different shift than me, although we’ve worked together before. The first time I saw her maybe four months ago almost right away before I had another conversation with her I went up to her and asked if she was single (first cold approach I’d ever done, so was a bit nervous), she said no; and we talked for a bit. Afterword I’d occasionally say hey to her when I saw her, and the occasional conversation, but nothing major.

Recently: I’ve been working out a bit more, have gotten a new car, and look loads better and confidence is super high because behavior is great. a few weeks back she offered to help me do something that she wasn’t required to do, I thought she was just being nice, and we talked for a bit, connected pretty well. I hadn’t seen her since until today.

Today: here’s a list of things she’s done that make me think she’s interested (I looked up a list online and these are points I can recall her doing now that I think of it):
1. Feet pointed toward me
2. Body pointed toward me
3. Reacts positively when I gave her a high five
4. I’ve noticed her blush around me
5. Pupils dilated
6. Slight mirroring
7. Smiling
8. Strong eye contact
9. Preening; applying chapstick
10. licking lips while looking at me
11. Tilts and leans in head
12. Open body language
13. Super interested in my conversation
14. Laughed at almost all of my jokes
15. Took my side in most conversation that involved a buddy of mine that works with me normally
16. We flirted a lot
17. Stayed longer than she had to to work with me
18. My buddy was busting my balls and held up a heart with his hands, obviously he noticed something
19. Complimented me a few times; ex she likes doing things for me
20. Gave me a chance for innuendo (maybe I’m crazy though) when she held up a piece of tape, and mentioned that it was bigger then she was expecting but it would do fine.
21. Touching of the neck
22. Hoping I remembered an important detail about her
23. Teasing

I should’ve got her number and asked to hangout, although I realize I’ve never actually asked for any persons - especially a girls - number (usually they give it to me or just dm me on ig which I deleted rather recently); plus I couldn’t think of a way to do it without coming off as weird (as she previously rejected me, and I don’t wanna be that guy who asks every girl out, or the same girl even though she says no.

First let me get the standard does she like me out of the way? I’m terrible a picking up on signals, as there have been a lot of girls that have given me signals like these and end up having boyfriends when I ask about whether they’re single; I guess girls are usually really flirty toward me? Also I have bad self esteem sometimes, I guess due to my lack of relationships and I wasn’t the most popular or good looking dude in school, so sometimes I think to myself why would a girl like that be interested in me, although I try and correct that.

How to casually ask her to hangout sometime? I don’t have a lot of friends, and I’ve never really hung out much before, or organized something like that so how do I go about that?

I’m friends with her friend so I’ll probably ask the friend and see if the girl is single.

Thank you for any advice.

TLDR; I asked a co-worker at an entry level job if she was single a few months back, she said no. Recently she came up to me and has been giving me strong attraction signs, I’m definitely interested in her, but is she interested in me? If so how do I ask her to hangout casually, without it being weird as she’s rejected me once before. Thanks for the advice.",2019-07-06 05:17:57,1,2,dating_advice

UPDATE:

I am so exhausted, as is he.

After 1 week of blocking him/no contact and my exbf's friend reaching out to me, desperately begging me to give my ex another chance, today we finally reconnected. And to be honest, I instantly regretted it.

The phone call was toxic on both ends. I had been suppressing my anger and disappointment and got triggered today, and I kind of exploded in angry tears to him at the beginning of the call. He said he was ""stunned"" and just didn't know how to react, and didn't imagine this type of conversation. He was pulling back again, distancing himself emotionally because of all the drama, after all the borderline suicidal, emotionally charged, panic-induced, anxiety-laden emails HE sent ME after I blocked him - which obviously made me worry.

Looking back at the phone call, I feel kind of bad, but I couldn't help it then. I had been suffering and suppressing, too.

One thing I was harsh about.. I yelled at him in tears, ""You should NOT be in a relationship. You should just keep having friends with benefits. You don't deserve me."" (I'm his first GF -- he's had a lot of fwb and one night stands before. In the beginning of our relationship, he told me he found girls boring outside sex in the past. He's literally unable to cope with emotions/serious conversations, doesn't want to deal with/confront problems and SOLVE them, and escapes to video games.)



Today I was going to cut contact again -- this time for good. I was mainly worried he was suicidal from his emails.

Him: ""Are you going to disappear again?""

Me: ""Yes.""

Him: ""I don't want that.""

Me: ""Of course you don't. But this is hard for me too. You don't think about me or care about ME.""

Him: ""I want you to stay with me while I get better \[recovery from depression\]. I'm already getting a little bit better.""

Me: ""But in order for me to stay with you, I have to be 10% of myself. I used to be 100% of myself with you.""

\[Note: I have to be 10% of myself because when he's depressed, I can't be real with him. I can't lean on him for emotional support. I can't be my full, whole self with him. I just can't be transparent with him at all because he is so fragile. I'm forced to only show my ""good"" parts so he doesn't get triggered.\]

Him: ""There's no point"" \[if I leave the relationship\]

Me: ""You have to get better FOR YOURSELF.""


The phone call had to end abruptly because I had to go. Just.. sigh. Please anyone. I can't even tell my family or friends about the reality of this situation because I don't want to humiliate him.

He's unemployed. He quit his last office job because he was getting anxiety (""Is this my job for the rest of my life?"" then got sick for 2 weeks. Came back. Overwhelmed with missed work. Got sick again from the stress. Knew he was going to get fired so he quit first.)

He's a high school dropout and couldn't even complete his last two assignments (recently) to get a diploma because of the depression. As for college, he said ""I don't think I can do it at all.""

He's been addicted to video games his entire life, more or less, even now.


TLDR; Broke up with depressed, unemployed exbf because his debilitating depression and anxiety was severely affecting our relationship and triggered my own aggressive tendencies, despite how ""loving"" I can be -- the ""drama,"" lashing out at him, wanting him to ""get better"" quickly, etc. I finally mustered the courage to block him because this was unhealthy for BOTH of us. He got crazy and sent me three long emails infused with suicidal language and HIS FRIEND even messaged me BEGGING me to give ex another chance. I did give another chance and reconnected. Didn't go well at all. I said I'm leaving (for good) and he said there's no point to his recovery if I leave.

I really, really, really need help. Thank you.",2019-07-06 02:45:29,13,3,dating_advice
294,c9pp1n,woahwoahwoahwoa,Spent a really great night with this guy but he hasn't texted me yet?,"Okay so I'll try to keep this as short as possible. I broke up with someone a few months ago and this guy used to be close to my ex. They are no longer friends  they had some sort of falling out and hadn't talked in months and they still don't talk. but when everything was fresh he was someone I could talk to we didn't really know each other before that well he was my ex's old roomate but he almost always stayed at my place so I never really saw him but we all go to school together. However we had a really public fight when things ended and he said he could be a resource for me. I would hit him up sometimes to vent and he would listen and thats basically all our relationship was. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway like two days ago I hit him up and this time we didn't talk about my ex. He kind of suggested that we could be friends so that was honestly all I was looking for. However I am super attracted to him I actually would see him around campus before I met my ex and had fantasies about him. Anyway we start talking and then he invites me over to drink together and watch this TV show. We do that and we go on a walk and he holds my hand and I feel like we're really hitting it off. He said I could spend the night and we ended up making out and it was really nice and he said he was really attracted to me and he was glad I came over because he had a lot of fun. He invited me to go swimming with him sometime and I told him about this dance competition I was in and he said he would come. He didn't try to have sex with me at all we just cuddled. I was so surprised because I didn't think he was attracted to me at all. My ex always said that he only liked white girls. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways its been a day and he hasn't texted me. I thought we had a really good time. I'm scared to text him first because I don't want to seem clingy. I'm sure he's probably only looking for a casual relationship which I'm cool with I'm just excited to be excited about someone I haven't felt this way since my breakup I feel like I have been forcing myself to have sex with other people and date other people but with him it just feels natural. Could it have just been the alcohol that made him say all those things? I'm kind of confused because he was the one who initiated the flirting and the kissing. I did kind of get a weird vibe from him when I left. I'm scared when he kissed me in the morning I had stinky breath or something. I really want to invite him to this gallery opening on Sunday but I don't want to be too forward..... What do you think he is thinking?",2019-07-06 04:56:23,2,2,dating_advice

We got back together in a month's time and tried long distance. We would visit each other every 3-4 months and it would be the best week ever. Although we both were trying to make.long distance work,none of us knew where we were heading. We both had our jobs which we couldn't quit just to move to the other person's location as long distance was really not working well.
I tried my best and till this day it feels very depressing that all that time,effort and love has led to nothing. She was my best friend and I don't have any friends in my life. Ever since the breakup, I have maintained no contact because I want to hold some self-dignity after getting dumped by her for the second time. She has deleted all social media accounts and my number.  There has been no effort from her side to reach out to me ever since the breakup and that just makes me feel horrible. She was my love and best friend for 7 years and now we don't even talk or care about each other. 
Sometimes I feel like I am going to break and try to contact her,but I fear that it's going to hurt me more if she rejects me again which will make it harder for me to move on.

This story is about myself - Male - 19 and my now ex-girlfriend - Female - 19.

Hi, about a year ago my high school girlfriend and I broke up due to college. It was very mutual, as she would be going to school about 4 hours away from me and did not want to do long distance. It was one of those things that I knew was coming. I saw it as just, ""a part of life."", when we broke up I wanted to make sure we got the chance to sign each others yearbooks before we went to school. In that period of time between the day we broke up and the day we would eventually sign each others yearbooks, I started to think to myself. And I came to the conclusion that I actually really liked this girl. I genuinely missed her in my life. So, when I picked her up that day that we signed each other's yearbooks, I wrote this really sweet &amp; true paragraph right in the back page, she did the same. As I drove her home, we really didn't talk much, but right before I dropped her off - I pulled over to the side of the road. I looked at her and said, ""I really just wouldn't be able to deal with myself if I didn't ask you something."" and she said go ahead and ask. I said something along the lines of, "" I know long distance sucks and I would never want to do that to myself, unless it was you..."" and as I said that I choked on my words a little, and my eyes started to water. As that was happening she started to cry hysterically, and then I did too. She looked me in the tear-soaked eyes and said she couldn't. That she just couldn't. To provide some context, she dated this girl a few years ago that cheated on her because she lived far away etc. So, I understood that and I pretty much knew that was what she was going to say to me. So, I dropped her off and she kissed me and I hugged her. And that was the last time I ever saw her.

My first year of college rolls around. My first semester I called her one day, I was homesick and just hoping to talk to a familiar voice. I got sent to voicemail and left a stupid response that went something like. ""Hey, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ hope you're doing great, just wanted to see how your first weeks of college are, if you don't answer me I totally understand why."". I never got a call back (understandably). Anyway, I learn that my ex started dating someone new. It was a girl (did I mention she was bisexual? no, well she's bisexual.) anyway, this girl was one of her friends that I never got to meet, but knew who she was. They worked at a summer camp together, and she worked at it that summer that we broke up. In fact, the week before we broke up, she was working at this summer camp, she made me write her a letter, I remember putting a lot of effort into it. She barely responded to my texts when she was there. That's when I knew it was over. But it made me wonder, did she cheat on me? I don't think she did, she has a very personal &amp; negative experience when it comes to cheating. But still, made my mind run wild. Anyway, freshman year of college. I consider myself to be a pretty decent human being, and average ""looks""-wise. So, I hook up with about 4-5 different girls my freshman year. I feel nothing towards them though. 

The story behind telling you all the backstory above is, I cannot get over her. I do not know why, but it's driving me insane. I miss her, but I cannot talk to her while she's dating someone. And she looks so happy with this new girl, it makes me wonder if she was ever even happy with me.

It's almost a year later and I just think about her a lot. I have to say though, our relationship, when we were together was great. I had no complains, she was (and still is) a beautiful , snarky, amazing girl. I mean she made my boring live so much more interesting. I'm not going to lie, I wasn't the perfect boyfriend by any means. I bought her a lot of things to make sure I spoiled her, but I wish I spent more time trying stuff that she enjoyed. My biggest regret is that I should've make more of effort to be interested in things she liked. I regret it so much.

I feel as if I'm hopeless for love. My closest friends all have girlfriends, two of my close friends have been dating the same people for 2 years. I've never had that. I feel as if I can never establish stability in my life. That as soon as I get to a point where I have something, like a stable relationship. It just falls apart.

Do I wait for this girl to break up with her girlfriend and try and get back in touch with her? Do I just forget about her completely?

I just feel **insane**. I want to be able to have a clear head again.

That I am likely going to live a solitary live with no family, wife, or even close friends. They say ""be yourself"", but ""myself"" isn't really the kind of man a woman would want in her life, I lack empathy, my sense of humor is either corny, random, or offensive, my interests and passions are odd. And well, I'm basically emotionless, more often than not I feel like nothing, and that I am nothing and that what I really am is carbon and water in the form of a human. 

I've been feeling this way since I was around 14, and ever since I recognized my problems I did everything I could to try and boost my confidence, add value to myself, and make myself more likeable. At the end of the day, I'm still the same person I was, whatever changes have happened mean nothing in the grand scheme of things. 

That made me realize that I can either complain about it, fix it, or let it be. Complaining about helps to vent, bit doesn't do anything in the long run. I've tried to fix it, but that also doesn't help, therefore my best bet is to deal with my situation, and let it be.

But I'm having such a hard time accepting the reality. I want to know what it's like to feel loved and desired for who I am. I want to grow up knowing that maybe one day I'll have a family. And at the end of the day, humans are social animals, which means that living alone and being lonely goes against our nature. 

All I want at this point in my life is to just accept the reality. I want to learn to be content with being alone and having noone. I want to learn to see the positives in being alone and single.

I just don't know Person A as well and I don't know yet whether I want a relationship with them. 

\- Between dates 2 and 3 with Person A, Person B on the same app asked for drinks. I'm curious about Person B and said yes.

My only evidence to back this claim is that when i tried to set up plans for a date she is always busy/unavailable. not to mention she takes hours or even days to respond to texts. i personally feel that if she was interested she would put forth some effort right?? and im a patient person honestly. i told her that when she finds a day that works for her to just let me know. its been a week since that conversation and im hesitant to text her to ask yet again if we could set a date.  i dont want to seem pushy but i am eager to go on this date with her...

am i being to impatient here? or does this seem odd to anyone else? id love some feedback",2019-07-06 03:06:01,3,2,dating_advice

But since he is older he is about to go into the army and said he doesn’t want to be in a relationship for at least three-five years. Till he is done with the army basically. But by then i don’t know if i will already have a boyfriend. 
I really like him. Plus we talk like i said almost every other day. But once he told me he didn’t want to be in a relationship I was confused.
For you see he had been sending all these mixed signals to me saying stuff like, Oh you’re so pretty, you’re so amazing, i like you.
I don’t know if he actually likes me or not. If he is saying all these things about him liking me but then saying i don’t wanna date anyone.
We have a three hour time difference at the moment, but if he doesn’t like me in that way would he stay up till 5 (his time) in the morning to just talk to me.

So I’ve [26M] been out of the dating game a while, and I recently got back in a position to where dating was fitting for my lifestyle. I’ve spent quite a bit of time on dating apps but mostly have had no luck. Last Monday, I matched with a cute girl [25F] who was smart and quirky. We had some great conversations for a few days and I asked her to get coffee/a drink this past weekend. She said she was busy moving during the weekend but would have some availability during this current week. I said great, send me your availability and I’ll suggest some times to meet. Didn’t hear back from her, so the next night I asked something related to a prior conversation of ours, once again no response (this was last Friday night).

I waited all weekend, nothing. Monday comes and goes. Tuesday night I’m starting to feel like I got ghosted but I know she is studying for her masters so I gave her the BOTD, but I messaged her “hey! Are we still on for this week?” No response again.

I’m definitely not sending her another message unless I get a response, but man, what a shitty feeling. This would’ve been my first date in a while so I got pretty excited, got some new clothes, a haircut, etc. Majorly bummed about this. Unfortunately, I know it’s going to linger in my head for a while until I get another date lined up, but as I said early, I won’t be sending her a message until she sends me one.

Sorry to all you fellow pals that have been ghosted. It sucks. Also, I guess I’m just venting here primarily. 😔",2019-07-06 02:43:07,8,2,dating_advice
316,c9okeq,stardustertoo,I [30F] have been struggling with dating because I like typical “guy” stuff,"This is my first post so sorry if I am not posting correctly.

I moved from NYC to LA about a year ago, and have struggled dating here. I’ve never really had trouble dating before (in three previous cities either) and I feel like the common issue is they get freaked out if I am into any typical “guy” things.

For example, the last guy I was dating talked down to me for being into motorcycles and that I go riding with friends but didn’t have a bike of my own. It only came up because on our third date, one of the guys we were playing pool against was a stunt driver so it’s not like I was bragging either. It was actually really hurtful—I didn’t see him again.

I had another guy get all quiet and lose interest in me when I diagnosed what was wrong with his roommate’s car (his battery wires were corroded, it wasn’t even that major) and gave him a tip on how to deal with it.

Another guy, we were at the beach in a group and one of his friends leant me a surfboard so I could surf, and my guy didn’t know how to surf. Lost interest.

Actually that same guy previously had came over to my place so I could change before we went to dinner and was shocked I had a PS4 and then got all weird when I started talking about the game I was playing at the time. (It was RDR2–who doesn’t want to talk about Arthur Morgan??)

I am successful in a male dominant field and thats been an issue too—I don’t discuss income but just success and work stories have freaked more than one guy out if they don’t have things to say about themselves.

Should I be trying to be more girly? I’m really into fashion, generally wear heels and get done up before dates so maybe it’s just unexpected based on my appearance. Its also a shock for me because in NYC and previous cities this was never an issue, and most of the time it was a quality instead of a negative.

Any advice on what I should do differently?",2019-07-06 02:41:19,10,2,dating_advice

I feel yall, dating is frustrating. But relax, don't drive yourself crazy over it. Especially if you're my age when we're mostly still experimenting, figuring out what we like/want. Their's plenty of people out there to date. If you strike out with one, move on. If there is no chemistry, they're not for you. Can't find a relationship? Look elsewhere, or work on yourself in the meantime. Worried about being a virgin? It might seem like a big deal, but don't knock yourself over it. Some people are late bloomers. Sometimes it's better to wait for the right person to come along. Have fun, learn from mistakes, stay optimistic. Dating is one of those things that's better when you let it happen naturally or when you don't take it super seriously. I'm not saying to not give a f**k. Just relax, take a deep breath, and keep it moving.

325,c9nk91,robstyg,confused about a girl; don't know what to do,"Hey!

I \[19/m\] have been chatting with a girl \[18\] I've matched on tinder for over 2 weeks. We both noticed how much we had in common, made compliments to each other and talked about meeting next week. It really felt like we had a connection and even though I've never seen her in real life, I already started developing feelings towards her.

At some point, she just stopped replying for 4 days. I was really sad but I thought I had to move on, so I basically told her that I don't know what or if I did anything wrong, but that I had to delete her number now, to be able to move on. She then finally replied the next morning with an even longer text, stating that she spent the last few days thinking and that she came to the conclusion that she isn't ready for a relationship yet. She emphasized that I wouldn't be the problem and that she'd always be there for me as a friend if I wanted to talk. I told her we could still be friends, but honestly just so that I don't completely lose her. Ever since we don't really chat much anymore, and again she's the one not replying. I thought it might be a good idea to ignore her for a while to see if she even cares, but then I messaged her again last night and there's still no response.

I'm assuming her not being ready for a relationship isn't the real reason, because why would you even look for guys on tinder then? I just don't understand what her reasoning behind all of this is. I'm 100% sure she was interested in me, and it's not like I've said something that could've upset her. If she thinks I'm ugly or something, why would she even message me on tinder when we matched and give me her number? We didn't even meet yet, I just don't get why she would do all of this before we have even seen each other person.

328,c9hq5z,Richie1994,Flirty Female Coworker," Hello there, I am a 25 year old male working at an advertising company. I've been working there for about 3 years now, and about 4 months ago this brunette was hired. She's actually my boss's secretary. One day, probably  2 months ago, I went to the printing room. While printing accounting information, she walked in and introduced herself. I'll call her Jen for privacy. I introduced myself to her, shook her hand, then she smirked and walked away. I thought to my self she was nice and beautiful. I bumped into her a couple of more times after, just friendly banter. By now I've only known her for about 2 weeks. I noticed that she  heavily flirts with others. For instance, she would hold her hands behind back and drop a pen, so she could bend down showing her butt to the man she was talking to. Another example is while delivering paperwork to a male she will go sit on their lap. She'll do this when there is no other woman in the room and when there's about four people in the room. Of course she won't do it if the boss is around. She wouldn't do this to me. Fast forward about 8 days. I'm at a food court in the mall. I'm eating a hot dog and listing to Frank Sinatra's I've got you under my skin. I didn't notice her sit next to me, so I jumped when she pulled an earbud out of my ear. She apologizes for startling me, then asked if she could have a bite of my hot dog. Confused and caught off guard by the question I said yes. After she took a bite, she sips from a slushy cup of hers and offers some to me. I say no, but she waves it in my face and insist that I slurp some. Pressured into it, I slurped some. She then smiles and slowly places her lips on the straw and slurp. As I go  back eating my hot dog, all of a sudden she says I left a great taste on her straw. I was really caught off guard by that. I ask what she means, and she says that I left a minty taste on the straw. I finished my hot dog, and I was about to go until she asks what was my sign. I asked why and she says because she wants to see if were compatible. I say I'm a Gemini, why. She says that she is  Aquarius, which means were're highly compatible. We talk for about 20 more minuets and she says that really have to go and she would like to meet like that again. The following day I notice that she's talking with another coworker. It looked as if she was about to kiss him on the cheek, until she noticed me and came over and said she had a really great time the day prior. She walks me out the room and compliments my hair, and grips my hand. I ask her why is she acting like this towards me. She starts looking confused and asks like what. I tell her how flirtatious she's been, especially yesterday. She tells me she's interested in me. I don't admit I have a little crush on her too. I then ask what makes her interested in me, and why she flirts with the other men in the work place. She says it's just for fun, but her feelings for me are real. Our conversation ends when our boss walks in. Fast forward again, Jen has continued flirting with everyone. On the first of July,  I met up with this other female worker I've liked for a while. Let's call her Lucy. Lucy has been working here for about 2 years now, and she's very nice and cute. I actually feel like she has a crush on me too. Lucy and I were discussing our weekend plans (Usually on weekends, we hang out together with some of our friends at the bar). By this time Jen walks into the room and speaks to Lucy and me. Jen asks what were we discussing and Lucy answers. Jen turns to me and asks if I could come with her clothes shopping. I look at Lucy and look back at Jen. I tell them both I get back to them Saturday. That's why I'm here. I was wondering if I should go with Jen, because I kinda like her, but I don't know if I should go through with it. Or should I just go for Lucy, because I already like her.

She has recently broken off with her bf due to constant mental abuse and she tells me about her problems. I like to think of myself as a good listener so I tell her that things will be alright and she’ll find another good man. 

However, as we keep talking she starts hinting more to the two of us reconciling (calling me bb, screenshotting my pics on Snapchat, etc.), she even said she misses me.

I have no experience with dating. I have never asked someone out and am pretty shy though I used to be way worse. I really like a girl(20F) from my uni.

Here's the thing. I haven't ever had a meaningful conversation with her (one-off interactions in classes) and I can't approach her in person. Lately I said to myself I will try to find an excuse but I'm always petrified. It doesn't help that she's always with a friend of hers or other people I keep contact with so I can't possibly tell her how I feel in front of them.

I am at a point where all I think about is her, it's been affecting me pretty seriously lately, I used to be afraid of even the idea of texting her but now I think I'm ready to do that. But reading up on this sub people usually look down on messaging. Should I go for it? We're not friends on fb but we're in large groups together so I hope it won't come off weird If I message her out of the blue. I thought about doing this in a couple of days because we will only have to meet once for a final exam before summer and it won't be awkward as seeing her every day would.

334,c9jaao,throwaway7373848e,When to meet the family?,"I (M 33) recently started dating this awesome woman (31). We've seen eachother only like 3 times, but we both agree that we hit it off really well and feel like this could become something real. 

Now I just want to enjoy time together for a while without feeling any obligations towards her family or my own. I find it quite difficult to introduce myself to new people, let alone those who want to know if you're ""good enough"" for their sister or daughter. I tend to shut down and feel like people might think I'm either boring or arrogant. In short, I'm super insecure with situations like that and don't know how to deal with it well.

The thing is, because we both feel good about how it's going, I already know it's inevitable to meet. But now she kinda asked me if I wanted to join dinner with her brother and SIL. That would be like our 4th date... 

What would be a good time to meet the family? And how can I help myself staying cool when the time comes?",2019-07-05 18:19:06,2,5,dating_advice

337,c9ojn1,DarkHorizon794,Getting tinder plus seems to have made things WORSE,"Can anyone here tell me if they've had a similar experience with Tinder? When I was on the free version of tinder, I was getting dozens of matches even with the 100 swipe limit, I was able to get like 21 matches in 2 days. Then I actually payed for tinder plus, and now no matter how many people I swipe right on, I end up with nothing. I know its because of low exposure, because the 21 girls I matched with before on free tinder were between 4/10 and 8/10. Obviously it seems like Tinder is scamming people, and thats just about the lowest thing they can do. Unless something I did made my elo score go down, but i swipe left on like 20% of the people I see, so im not a mass swiper, im not a scammer, wtf more does tinder want??? Why are they doing this to people? I even created a different account with a different number and tried putting a perfect 10/10 male model's photos on there, and he got 30 matches in the first 24 hours but then after that NOTHING, no matter how many swipes it was just silence. Then at this point WHO GETS MATCHES ON TINDER? If even the most perfect men cannot get matches, then who is even able to use this shit?

340,c9kqsb,Jeremyzez,She doesn't initiate and gives rather short replies,"So I (22M) just posted a few days ago about a 2nd date with a girl (22F). In short, everything went well except for when I drove her home and we both kinda froze and had one of those painful moments of awkward silence. Regardless we made out when she got out of the car.

It really bothers me that I've somehow given a rather boring impression of myself because of the silence we had. I've texted her and she always replies without any longer delays. Her replies, however, are rather short. And even though she does use emojis and stuff it still feels kinda cold. And also, as stupid as it may sound, I feel offended if a girl replies with text only if I sent them a snap, lol. Like if I'm sending you a snapselfie it means I want to see your cute curly hair (aight back to the topic). 

She's currently on a vacation with her family for 1.5 weeks and I understand that she wants to spend time with them. But if a girl really likes you, shouldn't they be trying to continue text conversations in any way possible? Like I've had some girls bomb me with messages and just ask me stuff they probably already knew. 

I really don't know what to make of this. I like her and she likes me or at least that's what I've concluded because why would you make out with someone multiple times if you didn't like them?

I hate it when my last brain cell ejects when I finally meet an amazing girl with whom I could actually have a RL.

tl;dr: Been on two dates with a girl. Made out several times. Gives short replies. Is currently on a vacation so probably has things to do. Not sure if she's lost interest or just not into texting in general.",2019-07-05 20:24:35,2,3,dating_advice

She just automatically had her eyes on me but never said anything. 

She kept staring at me and as I peeked my eyes over and whenever we’d make eye contact but it would be really long (like 5 or longer secs). Whenever we laughed she’d always stare into my eyes. Then she got tired and started resting her shoulder on me and my friend and I rested my head on hers but she didn’t seem to mind.

We then went home but she wasn’t ignoring me but wasn’t looking at me as much or as chatty. I did end up talking with her sister and her when she got to her house but then I went home.

A month ago my partner found out that he is going to be out of a place.. today. As in- today was his last day at the apartment. I’m still expecting the ‘come over’ text so it’s all really fresh and doesn’t feel quite real. 

He still has a job and his truck- his mom allows him over to shower. But I still can’t imagine it being too comfortable. 

I want so badly for him to stay with me, but I am not in the position to do that. I don’t live on my own and I can’t have him here like that.. the people I live with wouldn’t allow it. 

I just.. don’t know what to do, think, or feel. Honestly. I’m all over the place. It’s not happening to be so I feel a bit ridiculous for being this upset about it but not knowing where he’s sleeping at night or how he is actually doing and feeling hurts so so badly. 
he is a very stubborn, driven, strong-willed &amp; hardworking man so I know he will be okay in that sense but deep down i know things really suck for him right now and he isn’t the type to complain. 

His ultimate plan is to work and live uncomfortably for a month for two until he can save enough for an apartment of his own.. I’m so worried about how that will go. One month often turns into 2, then 3,etc.. 

How do i help him ? I know that i am not his mom, I am responsible for myself only, etc.. but I love this man. He has been there for me when I needed him so I will be there for him. 
What can I do or even say in this situation to offer him any solace? 

I know our relationship is going to get a little weird.. not for any other reason then he (&amp; i as well) have so much to do and worry about so we probably won’t communicate or see each other as much.. 

How can i make the best of this? How can I help him make the best of this?.. while also preserving myself?

Now I ain't one for shaming people but this was just baffling to me and the more I learned the more I was put off by her. And I didnt know anything else about this girl except she might have sex with me that night. No personality not even a picture.

And I'm by no means anti sex but I wasn't looking for a hookup and I'm still not. I want a normal relationship with normal things. Sex is more or less the last thing on my mind.

We both connected on how shallow and fake it seems and we're both kinda tired of it.  
  
Anyways one thing to another and we set a date and meet, and we had a fun date, talked over drinks, walked around for a while and got to know each other (well her mostly, I didn't talk as much as I usually do because she was so fun to listen to) and I really liked how open and honest she was and I told her that too. Before the date she said she wouldn't be able to stay out too long because she works very early in the morning but we ended up talking until I ended it (worried about her next day), and she was super enthusiastic and wanted to meet again and asked me about my schedule and told me about hers.  
  
After the date though, she's kinda unresponsive and I try to prod her a little bit with jokes here and there but I'm not getting much back and this is throwing me off because it's the first date where I felt like I had a good time without fronting, and she seemed like she had a good time, but there's no real followup.

We've always been very open with one another and share sex stories and all kinds of personal stuff (as best friends do I guess) but it's like we both know when we're talking about it we are turning each other on. 
Last year we were both single and talking about sex and one thing led to another, then we ended up as FWB for a couple of months but I stopped it as he was a bit clingy. He meets someone and things go back to normal between us..
2 years later they break up and we have sex again. Just twice but it brings up feelings I thought I'd never have. Just that I could possibly see myself dating him. Well because he starts seeing someone else I keep my feelings to myself, but then when he breaks up with this other girl a month later and he starts bringing up FWB with me again I decide to tell him I like him. Didn't go well, he said he doesn't like me like that. I cry, he tries to hug me then I quickly leave. 
I'm just really hurt he said that because of the way he is with me I thought he would at least be open to it. He's always saying what a great catch I'd be and he thinks I'm really attractive, he obviously likes the sex between us but guess that's not enough. We are very different in that I'm fairly confident, like my own space. He's very self conscious/needy and needs to be reassured a lot, but we have so much in common and do get on great!

Since this is the work place, I want the most assurance I can get of a positive outcome, to avoid some sort of complaint against me before I make an attempt to approach her. Here's what I can tell you.

So, we've never really spoken, she seems like the shy quiet type, which is usually the type of girl I attract. But there was this one time I was working, you know doing my thing, minding my business, and whenever someone walks past I usually look at them, just to see who it is. Well, it was her, and she was looking at me, made eye contact, and she smiled. Now, she passed by not to long after, maybe 10 minutes or so, again, made eye contact, smiled. It was near the end of my shift so I was heading out and I passed by her again, she did glance at me, but no smile this time. She seemed like she was looking for something, you know that thing you do when you put your head up and like scan the area trying to find something. She usually does look at me when we pass, but we don't see each other too often because she works a later shift and she's in a different dept. Now, yesterday, when I was coming back in from my lunch break, I went to go clock in and she was standing at the clock looking at the schedule, she glanced at me. I walked past her to get to my locker, I turned around for a second and she looked over at me and smiled. That's when it hit me, maybe she is interested in me. So I was keeping my eye out for her to see if she would look at me again or something. Well I didn't see her again until I was leaving work and on my way out I saw her working while I walked past, I stopped and decided to walk by her, maybe say hi in passing or something. So as I'm walking in her direction, I kind of just casually looked around so I wasn't just staring at her, and when I got close, maybe 10 ft or so, she looked up at me and smiled, then quickly looked back something she was holding, then she turned around and started to do something, just as she had her back turned to me I hear her say something but no one else is around and I realize she said ""How's it going?"" Not looking at me or anything, she was working. I said hi (because I was totally caught off guard by that and I didn't immediately know she was talking to me). and kept on going. Yeah, I know, lame, I could have stopped and tried to converse with her, but my heart was already pounding just from walking past her. I barely got that Hi out. 

So, what do you think of that? Do you think she's giving me signs? I mean I know she could just be a friendly person, but I'll tell you, she's the friendliest person at work because no one has smiled at me every single time they see me, like she has.

We're talking 3-5 days response for a simple text.  Normally, I'd just say he's not into me. And that very well may be the case.  

But lately when he responds, he says something to the effect of ""sorry, this divorce stuff is just sucking the life out of me"".  

I like the dude.  But not sure what to do. If he liked me, I think he'd make some effort... or is it possible he's just wrapped up in his divorce and I should just give him space and see if he ends up re-engaging with me?

She ended up cheating on me twice, and even though it took me a while, I really do believe I'm over it. It'd never work between us, and I don't want anything to do with her.

I had one girl interested in me since then, but I wasn't interested so that went nowhere.

I'm curious about trying dating again after I saw my brother find a great girl on a dating app (after 6 months of weirdos and disappointment). I don't even know where to start though. I've got low self esteem and some social anxiety, so meeting people out in the open seems too difficult. but dating apps seem like a losing proposition too.

I'm inevitably going to get friendzoned/rejected on these apps if I do them, and I don't know how I'd handle it. I like to think I could handle it because I know it happens to mostly everyone, but the idea of spending money and time on dates with someone and having it go nowhere makes it feel pointless to me.

If you've got similar problems (low self esteem or social anxiety), how has your luck been with dating? Have you used apps? What were your experiences with them? Anything I should know?

This is all in a casual fwb context which is what we agreed we were both looking for. But after that she hasn’t texted me back after i asked her if I could come over Wednesday night since I had all night long. 

So my question is if the sex is apparently so good, why did I get ghosted? I’m very new to relationships and I guess I’m trying to gauge what I did right and wrong because overall I’m pretty proud of myself for even doing something like this.",2019-07-05 20:10:20,3,2,dating_advice

When I asked him, he replied ""because you're a cute, nice girl who likes me"" and I don't mean to sound ungrateful for the compliments but it made me feel kind of shitty. I know he isn't the best with his words and this is his first relationship. I'm trying to work on my self confidence, but it made me feel like I'd be easily replaced. Another time he said the same thing but added how he likes that i'm ""artsy"". There's a million nice, artistic girls who are much prettier than I am. I guess I just needed to vent about it a bit.

367,c9mts8,TheTwistedKorre,Just realized something “awful”(?) and need help with clarification,"So, I recently got home from a birthday party a female friend of mine hosted, quite the show since it was her twenty year birthday.

Anyways, while I was there I tried to enjoy myself (long-term depression and anxiety which I’ve recently begun treating with external help) and it worked for a while. But then the anxiety started creeping up on me and I started to notice my male (single) friends started to one after one getting that “special” attention from the opposite gender, except for me who was pretty much left out.

So in my own mind, since I’ve been kinda failing at the dating game, noticed something “awful”; am I really that unattractive/non-interesting that no one from the opposite sex notices me?

Besides those thoughts I enjoyed the night with friends that I haven’t seen in a year or two due to me moving to another town for work.

Sorry, first post on Reddit and I just needed to say it instead of just thinking about it myself and maybe get a tip or two from people whom experienced similar moments.

FYI I’m a 23 turning 24 year old male, been single most of my life and the very few times I’ve ever been in an relationship it always ended in me getting dumped over another guy either by cheating or in a more honest way. I’ve always been an introvert and having long-term depression for a couple of years which I’ve recently begun treating with external help as I cannot handle it myself anymore.",2019-07-05 23:36:47,2,1,dating_advice
368,c9mt6c,geishageishageisha,Why would a guy who suggested being fuckbuddies avoid meeting after you agreed?,"The long short is we agreed that we wanted to be casual. Actually I hinted it, he suggested it explicitly, I agreed, then he said he wasn’t sure. I asked why that was and he said he had assumed I wanted to be serious when we met... eventually he said he did want to.

I had no doubt he was attracted to me - I don’t really need to go into all of the details but I know for sure that he would have wanted  to hook up even without him telling me. When we first met he was all over me. The sexual chemistry was definitely there. But I wasn’t feeling it on a relationship ship level - as a consequence I didn’t let things escalate at all, even though he asked to see me several times (date ideas) because I wasn’t sure what he wanted and I didn’t want to make assumptions. He ended up ghosting mid convo after almost 2 months of talking to me every day. I completely understood this because I never saw him again after the first date and he had been trying for over a month to see me again. 

Fast forward a few months he reaches out apologises - we start talking and that’s how we went on another date. He seemed cool about it at first excited to see me again, then I guess he met some other people - or was actively trying to meet other people without shutting me down. Eventually I called him out and asked what was up, and that’s when I said clearly that I wasn’t ready for a relationship or anything serious, so he didn’t have to feel weird about “wanting less”. I said that because I got the impression that he didn’t want to take me on a date but he wanted to see me, which is why he agreed that he wanted to see me again but Never made plans. 

That was when we had the conversation that we wanted to be casual. But again he never made plans. I ended up deleting him from my social media - just because I don’t like keeping that kind of situation around. For me I was just drawing a boundary since he went from acting weird to being rude. I told him that I didn’t want to see him any more and he apologised. However I invited him to a house party one night a few weeks later and we hooked up, he met my friends and stayed the night. I noticed that he was more interested in cuddling and asking me questions than the sex. Even after we had sex and the morning after he wanted to cuddle for a few hours before he left. 

So after that my impression was, he wanted to be in my life but didn’t want to have sex with me if I was having sex with other people. He was a bit better after that, would message more often etc. But I never added him back in social media. He started acting weird a month after we hooked up (between then we had a dinner date because I just wanted to see him in a non drunk or sex context - I suggested a coffee and he decided to make it dinner). By this point it was pretty clear he was depressed and also immature. He talked about his own life problems a lot, exes etc. He would sort of blurt these things out so I think he subconsciously did like having me to talk to, but at the same time didn’t actually want me. I know these insecurities were real but I wondered if he just did it for attention - he’s at the end of his college years and didn’t ever properly settle in or have a real relationship so my guess is he just didn’t realise that confidence is an intimate thing, and confiding in someone is usually something that would be mutual. It seemed like he was just lonely. 
However sometimes we would be half way through the conversation and he wouldn’t open the message for 24 hours, even though he was clearly online. Eventually I ended it and he seemed upset that I didn’t want to see him - despite not actually initiating plans to see me once in 4 months, and despite us having only hooked up once. 


He was quite complicated so there’s a lot he did - it’s hard to fit in a single post. What do you guys think? I don’t have any close guy friends to ask, so really this was a mystery.",2019-07-05 23:35:08,11,0,dating_advice

371,c9mrsv,jrtw,(33m) unsure of the level of contact with (28f)," Ok, so I had one date with a girl who I met on a dating site. I felt like the date went well but only ended in a hug so I figured she wasn't into it. We continued to text a bit, and she'd send unprovoked messages wishing me a good day and the like, so I figure the interest was there. I set up another date with her, and she bails on it just prior saying that she's sick. She then texts me later on saying that she'd probably be up to it tomorrow as she wound up feeling better and going in to a half day at work. Next day, same thing happens. Both times she did say that she felt bad and would drag herself out, but I of course told her to get some rest instead. I then figure I'd back off a bit and give her some space as I do tend to have a habit of jumping into things too fast. I get another text from her after a day saying that she's not ignoring me but just had a death in the family and is emotionally drained. So I'm not entirely sure where I should be in the comforting department, so I simply told her I was sorry for her loss, and that I understand. I also was up front with her and told her that I figured she'd wanted some space, and I was fine with that if it's what she needed, but that I'd also be there if she needed any help or just to talk. She said she wasn't sure but wanted to see me again but is a mess right now. It's been 2 days now without hearing from her, and we were pretty much on every day contact. I don't read into it too much, but the dating site shows she's online many times I log in too. I'm not really sure if I'm getting strung along here, or if I need to maybe step it up more and reach out to her, or really what I should be doing at all in this situation.

373,c9ihnx,AnxiousHumanBeing1,Trying to learn how to ask for a date. Need some advice.,"Hello everyone,

I'll begin saying I'm sorry for the wall of text below, but I thought that giving a lot of details was a good thing to do to receive good advice. I'm not a native English speaker so I'm sorry for any mistake.

**Some background**

I'm a 23 year old university student, excellent grades. I've only been in one relationship (no previous dating/sex/kiss experiences) which lasted ~3 years and a half. I broke up with her after a lot of months of thinking because of a ""dead bedroom"" and lack of affection from her part, but we kept on very good terms (we still chat regularly and hang out with our circle of friends from time to time).

I'm now single since a little more than a year and haven't had any kind of relationship with a girl since I broke up with my ex, not even a date. I've always been quite introvert, shy and anxious, with nonexistent self-esteem and even lived long periods of depression in the past but I really think it's gotten a lot better in the last years. I started going to the gym and I am more social in general but I still have some moments of loneliness and/or depression every now and then.

As far as my look is concerned, I'd say I'm an average guy. Tall, athletic physique (I was a competitive swimmer from age 6 to 19), average face but shitty beard so I shave regularly.

**Now to the present**

A couple of months ago, during a DnD night, one of my friend, let's call him M, jokingly said that his girlfriend had a lot of single friends and got us to watch at their Instagram profiles. While looking at them I said one of them was very pretty, but it came out that she was actually in a long-term relationship.

A few days ago M invited some of our friends and I to dinner at a pub, and brought his girlfriend and one of her friend with him, *that friend* (let's call her L). She apparently broke up with her boyfriend in the past weeks.

The problem is I can't for the life of me start a one-on-one conversation with a girl I like without overthinking it. The only exception is if I know she's committed to a relationship. For example, last year I was able to talk to a girl I just met for two whole nights, just the two of us, only because of that reason. I was also able to talk calmly to M's girlfriend too through the night but I basically did not speak a word directly to L.

Nonetheless, I managed to invite M, his girlfriend and L to play some table tennis on Tuesday night. I managed to gain some confidence and started a friendly small talk with her while the other two were playing. I had a feeling she was a swimmer, so I asked her what sport she's practicing and I was actually right, so I tried to continue on that subject since it was something we have in common. She answered smiling but did not try to ask something back, so I decided to not ask anymore in fear that I was just annoying her. Once we got home M told me that his girlfriend and L really enjoyed the night (their words) so I was pretty happy.

Today M messages me and tells me that L is dating a guy since a few days (it's something quite casual from what I understood). So now I'm here and I don't really know if I should try to take a chance and message her anyway to get to know her better or just don't bother at all. My gut says to follow the second path because on one hand I don't think she would be even remotely interested in me, but on the other hand I'm not really good at reading people.

So I'm here asking for specific and even general advice. Harsh advice is obviously welcome, I am very open minded and can take constructive criticism.",2019-07-05 17:12:35,6,3,dating_advice

379,c9m1dp,LightningPowers,"My brother is into his friend, whom rejected him previously, but he feels like he has to ask her again, despite fearing rejection.","Hello everyone,

I (23 M) had a talk with my little brother (19 M), and he is currently having relationship issues with a female friend (19 F) of his. After talking with my brother for a while, he told me a lot of things I did not know about. Now for the story;

&amp;#x200B;

So my brother and the girl are old classmates from college (graduated last year), and they played online games together every now and then but nothing that frequent. After a while, he realized that he was romantically interested in the girl, and after a while, confessed his feelings to her. She said no. That she did not see him that way. After that, he felt like shit and was very embarrassed whenever he was with her, so he felt like he could not even play games with her at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another important detail is that the girl had a previous relationship about three years ago, which did not end well for her. Apparently, she met a guy (he lived in the US) over the internet, who eventually flew over to Sweden (where we all live) to be with her. He made her do things that she did not want to do (together with him), but she felt like she was obligated to do because he had flew from the states to meet her. She then broke up with him, and has since then been very sensitive with the whole concept of romantic relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

After a year of not talking or playing together, my brother and the girl have started talking and playing games together again. Both parties have been talking very little with their other friends. My brother realized again that he still has feelings for this girl. Now they snapchat, talk over discord and message each other several times a day. My brother is not sure if she either likes him the most as a friend or if shes is romantically interested. He feels like he has to ask her, since for him, it is not worth spending any more time with her if she keeps turning him down. It doesn't help that she is super introverted and hates scheduling/planning so arranging meetups has proven hard for him for the past two weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother told me that if she were to reject him, he would feel suicidal, embarrassed and would hate himself. BUT, that he would be unable to remain friends with her if he never asked, since the feeling is clawing him from the inside out.

We met in December and he told me he had looked through every single Instagram and Facebook photo and he was crushing on me for all those months since we met.

&amp;#x200B;

Told me he has saved some of my photos on his phone, and once in May he told me he looks at them sometimes at work and they make his heart race (I don't know if that's still the case, he hasn't repeated that since May). He told me in May that he thinks about me all day (again, not sure if that's still the case, he hasn't repeated it since May).

&amp;#x200B;

Partway through May he told me for the first time randomly in a text, ""You're beautiful and I really like you a lot, just wanted you to know."" With a kiss+heart emoji. He has repeated this in similar ways a few times since then.

&amp;#x200B;

He started sending me red heart emojis once in a while since June, also stating things like ""I have strong feelings for you"", ""I love your smile"", ""I love your lips"", etc. He also tells me ""I miss you"" at least once a week when we're not together, or ""I missED you"" when we are on a date again. More recently he has also stopped mid-kiss two times now and told me, ""I feel so comfortable with you.""

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm wondering with all of the above... does it sound like he's in love OR just on the way to it but not there yet??

&amp;#x200B;

I think he might be in love BUT at the same time he hasn't asked me to be his girlfriend. He mentioned once in May that he's not dating anyone else but it was not any kind of serious discussion and he hasn't talked about it further since, we haven't had ""the talk"" to be exclusive or in a relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Does it sound like he might be in love based on the things he has said as quoted above? If yes, why wouldn't he say those words yet...? And if yes, why wouldn't we have had ""the talk"" yet - can you be in love before having ""the talk"" to be exclusive or would you only be in love with someone after confirming exclusiveness?",2019-07-05 22:17:44,5,1,dating_advice

For someone who has had a fair share of failed relationships and who is living in the modern tech world, it is frustrating to rely on dating apps.

From what I have experienced (and researched) it seems like dating apps focus on matching profiles, proximity and vanity. This does not seem like a promising way to connect people for long-lasting relationships. I think dating is way more complicated than swiping left.

&amp;#x200B;

I am interested to hear if you all think we are in need of a service (website/ app) that prioritizes self-development (guided tutorials, discussion boards, speak with a coach) before matching with a person. Think of a personal trainer for dating. I think most people have heard the cliche- if you don't love yourself, how can you love someone else?

384,c9nt77,PosadosThanatos,Is being a sociopath the absolute best thing to be for the dating world?,"Honestly, dating would be infinitely easier to do and maintain, as a guy, if I just didn’t give half a shit about absolutely anyone, saw everyone around me as a pawn, and had absolutely no empathy and practically no real emotions. As it stands, as a guy with BPD, getting relationships are basically impossible for me, I can get dates, I can date someone for two months at most, but that’s it.

However, if I felt nothing for anyone and was just a monster that viewed everyone as a pawn it’d be so easy, I’d never have to be alone and even if I did I wouldn’t care because I’d feel nothing and be nothing. It sounds like an amazing existence on some level, not caring about this world, others, or yourself. And not having to be depressed to achieve it either, just being a living machine, naturally. 

Of course, I’m not capable of things such as this, I can’t bring myself to view people as expendable and only ever want to harm absolute monsters and scum anyway, so, save I guess spending five years in the gym every single day to become muscular there’s nothing I can really do. I’m funny and have a magnetic personality, while my Reddit account is incredibly abrasive and aggressive, in person I’m considered decently likable to everyone that isn’t some awkward racist white person that just sort of automatically dislikes me for being a confident, outgoing black dude. 

Even then though, I just can’t get a relationship or maintain one, while I have a sickening skinny-fat body, facially I’m considered to be very handsome, and if I haven’t eaten (I technically just have 10% body fat but have a chubby stomach when I eat) I can notice that at least a decent amount of girls look in my direction, so I’m definitely not ugly.

Idk, I genuinely think if I were a sociopath I wouldn’t be alone like this, my girlfriend wouldn’t have dumped me, and so many things could’ve worked out. But I just don’t have the will or drive to hurt people that don’t deserve it, so I’ll basically be alone forever I guess.",2019-07-06 01:19:49,15,0,dating_advice
385,c9lh5l,Beisbol3040,Just got cheated on and dumped.... now what?,"Alright so you can check my old post for what happened but basically this gal played me. 

My self esteem is somewhat shot right now and in general it’s never the best. I am told I’m a handsome man. I workout a ton and I am career oriented. I deleted all my social media recently just to really focus on my career and what around me. Also a lot happier and much more focused since I deleted it all.

Problem, I work a high powered finance job surrounded by men. I trade nights so I am pretty much always tired. I don’t know a lot of women anymore and I just do not have the money or the time to hit the bars. I also don’t want to meet a gal at a bar anymore. I just ahhh idk what to do. It’s hard right now because I’m hurting and she’s out there getting fucked by another dude already consistently and I’m just sitting here alone. Def a bit depressed and idk I am lost. I am picking myself up everyday and busting my ass at work/ the gym. I am grinding to improve myself and my life. I just find it so unfair that women can just be pretty and have guys hit on them left and right. While I’m busting my ass to be successful and I feel like it’s damn near impossible to meet someone. I’m sick of the bars, I hate dating apps and idk it’s just like fuck. I felt like things were going to be a lot different at 25....",2019-07-05 21:28:07,1,1,dating_advice

I go to this church and it’s a small one kinda like those family ones where everybody knows each other. When I was 16(4 years ago), I started to become interested in one of the other members there. We have known each other for a long time since diapers really and I really wanted to date her, but she’s 2 years younger than me so at the time I didn’t want to be dating a 14 year old yadigg. Anyway I asked her father for permission to talk to her and he was cool with it so I was courting her for a while. I was going to make her my homecoming date but she had a prior commitment so I went with my friend who is now my ex girlfriend. You get the picture. I won’t go into that because that’s another story. Now fast forward to the present I’ve been single for a minute now about 1-2 years. This girl is still somebody I’m interested in and she’s going to the college that I go to. We talk every Sunday or so, and she seems pretty friendly but we have always been that way due to the closeness of our environment. Is it wise to still pursue her?

He’s 22(M) and I’m 21(F) so after a week of chatting online we set up a date to Six Flags because in his bio he said he liked 6Flags and I have a membership so it was a no brainer! It was a pretty bold date since the park is an hour away from where I live and you usually spend all day at amusement parks BUT it worked out. We had a fantastic time, he was the perfect gentleman and our 9 hour date ended with a passionate kiss. It left us both giggling for weeks haha so we continued talking a lot over the phone, getting to know each other more and two weeks later (yesterday) he wasn’t able to join me at the beach for the 4th of July so he brought me breakfast, and we ended up having sex LOL which was amazing! We cuddled up for a couple hours before my friend picked me up for our beach trip, during our little cuddle session we go to know each other a little more and we start talking about our future and he even suggested that we take a couple trips to places he’s never been to and now he’s calling me baby and sending me super cute messages. I think I know that he wants to be with me but he’s a really shy guy so I want to ask him but I don’t want to ask so soon and I don’t know how or when I should.

394,c9ksbq,CitizenMagnificent,I am a 21m who's never been in the online dating scene before and I would really love and appreciate some honest advice.,"I have dated 4 girls so far in life. Only one of them formed into a serious relationship back in just before my freshman year of high school. We both thought we were in love with eachother at first but it quickly degraded into one of the most toxic and worst  relationships of my entire life. We dated for about 3-4 years I think, there were some serious red flags about a year in the relationship. Im embarassed to say this, but honestly looking back I truly believe in my heart that it  was a very toxic and straight up abusive relationship. I had zero self confidence so I stayed in that relationship for waaay too long. It turned me off of dating for years and it ended up fucking up my perception of woman and relationships for a very long time. I haven't dated anybody since.

2016 was the year I completely turned my life around, I used to have a lot of self harm and addiction issues relating to mental health and depression throughout most of my life. And late 2016 I had enough of living a shitty life. I lost 30 lbs on keto, stopped abusing drugs, developed a more positive mindset and starting meditating, I also discovered my passion for music. Im a music producer (specifically making hip hop / trap beats) and Im in a mentorship program with a really successful music marketing expert, we're working together to turn my music into a full blown career and online business. I am happy and very very confident that I will make something big out of myself. My biggest goal in life is to get paid to make music and I really want help people who went through the same things that i went through in life, my biggest aspiration is philanthropy.


So I am happy in life now, im very much in a transition period of moving from the bad things in life to the really good things. But I haven't dated in years and I honestly don't have friends, I'm lonely, I feel as if I  have been lonely for too long. I miss intimacy and I yearn for a healthy long term relationship, I honestly kind of feel emotionally starved at this point, I really really miss  the act of something simple like hugging someone. At the end of the day I know i don't NEED anyone but I do want to start dating again, I want to get out of my bubble and see whos out there. I would rather try and fail than to never try at all. 

I just dont really know where to start. I would like to start online dating but i know 99% of the online dating scene is a shit show filled with thirsty men and fake bot accounts. So I dont know what to do, I want to try make a connection with someone but I know that im young and I know I have time so im conflicted.


I just need general advice is the point im trying to make. I guess I want to know a few things:

I would love to know what apps or sites would be good start. I am thinking of POF, coffee meets bagel, and maybe bumble or hinge but I don't know. 

I would also really advice in general when it comes to online dating in terms of the do's and dont's. Like I said I want to try to make a connection with someone genuine and I'm not afraid of a little rejection, I see it as part of the process

So yeah, is there anything in particular I should know? I literally have never done anything like this before so I just dont know really what to do.  I feel lost. And I honestly don't know if I'm trying to date for the right reasons or not.

For example, if you see someone at the bar that you want to talk to, just say ""Hi"" and ask her name, be direct in saying you're interested in her, or maybe start the conversation about something at the bar you're at, like the music, drinks, the area. If she's carrying on the conversation with you, that's a good sign, just let it flow naturally. 

I've heard one too many pick up lines that guys try so hard to come up with but honestly, they've never worked for me or any of my friends. It just makes us cringe.

Over time I've started to fall for her and I also get the feeling that she like me just because the way she interacts with me compared to everyone else that we hang out with. Me and her are both on a trip sponsored by AFROTC and we both go to different colleges on different sides of the states like I go to a Alabama college and she goes to one in California. She's cute, caring, funny and I just feel great when I talk to her. The trip is 3 weeks long and I've got one more week with her and I'm not sure what I should even do. My friends haven't been very helpful with advice. I want to tell her how I feel this weekend but I feel that would be wrong.

TL;DR - I 19M like a 19F that I've known for 2 weeks and I have one more week to really even ask her out. We both live on different sides of the country so it would be a long distance relationship and I'm not sure if I should go for it or let her go.",2019-07-05 20:25:57,4,1,dating_advice
398,c9e4ij,imxti_em,(Long post) I can't stop myself from being so picky..,"I hate how I manage to find imperfections in people. I'm not a mean person or ""too good"" or anything, I'm full of flaws myself, but I just keep thinking to myself that if I'm in a relationship, I need to be 100% satisfied with the person I'm dating. But I'm feeling it's impossible.

I've never been in a serious relationship and I'm 20(M). I've had some ""no strings attached"" relationships with girls, but I never felt that I'd be happy with any of them. I also had many friends who were into me but it's either the personality, the body type (I'm not body-shaming people, but every person definitely has a taste) or something else that ruins it for me and I don't move forward with it.

What's even worse is that I've ruined two of my best friendships because of this, and I'm trying my best to not lose my current best friend.. 

She's 17 and we just met this year, but we became so close quickly, we share the same interests and play games together, but I never felt any romantic attraction to her. I think she's catching feelings though, and I don't want her to. I don't even know how to avoid it, we literally talk everyday, watch videos together and play games. We didn't meet much though, and won't any time soon because I travelled. 

So she's a nice person, she's loyal, kind hearted, her parents are super nice and they like me, but then there are other sides that I dislike about her (don't feel like mentioning them publicly). I tried helping her work on them, but she gets mad at me and gets upset whenever I talk to her about them. I hate break ups, I hate hurting people and I hate making people upset, that's why I don't want a relationship that will end too soon.

406,c9jxun,SingleBumblebee,[23M] Feel sexually invisible to girls at uni and just don't know what I'm doing wrong. Help?,"I'm coming up on my last year of university and while I have accomplished many things, made many friends, and am performing well in my studies, I can't hide my disappointment that in terms of my dating and sex life, shit has been dry as the sahara.

&amp;#x200B;

Just to get the usual queries out of the way: Yes I do take care of my appearance and my hygiene. I shower every day, wear deodorant and cologne, make an effort to have nice fashion, am not overweight and not too skinny either, fresh haircut once a month, facial hair kept trim, brush teeth floss and mouthwash two times a day and regular visits to the dentist etc etc. I know that's all basic stuff and it doesn't entitle me to anything, but I just wanted to make sure no one replying presumes I'm a slob or that I don't take care of myself.

&amp;#x200B;

In my 2 years of uni so far (UK) I just don't seem to get any romantic attention from girls at all. I don't seem to struggle making conversation and making friends with girls, but it never goes further than that. There have been several girls I met in classes or through mutual friends who I was interested in dating, but none of them displayed any behaviour that would indicate they were interested in me back. Of those girls most of them ended up going on to get BFs who they are still together with, so pretty much every ship has sailed now.

&amp;#x200B;

Of my 4 closest uni friends who I hang out with the most, 3 of them have GFs now. When they were single they never struggled to have casual flings either. My friends have occasionally pointed out that girls ""were really into me"" at parties or in clubs, but when I go to speak to those girls, they show me no signs of interest. I don't get what I'm doing wrong, or perhaps my friends are just as clueless as me.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked a couple girl friends for advice on this (separately) hoping they could tell me what exactly it is I'm doing that's putting off women. I asked them to be brutally honest. Both of them said they didn't think there was anything glaringly wrong with me and nothing wrong with my appearance, but both said that I sometimes come across as ""stand-offish"" and ""angry"" in social situations and that that might be deterring women from pursuing me. Coincidentally a few weeks after this some non-uni friends of mine from school told me off the cuff that I look like I'm ""always frowning"". I don't intend to come across like this at all, and I never ever notice when I'm doing it. I'm diagnosed with mild asperger's syndrome so that's probably why it happens, but I have no idea how to stop it if it's hard-wired into my brain.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah. I'm very much at a loss here. To clarify also, since I didn't mention it earlier, I am also 100% inexperienced and have never been on a date, never kissed, never even asked a girl out since I was 16.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: I feel like no girls at uni take interest in me as a potential partner. I never get the usual signs of interest that my other male friends get. I asked girl friends what I'm doing wrong and they couldn't quite pin it down. Help?**",2019-07-05 19:15:39,8,1,dating_advice
407,c9jpdb,freebird348,Confused about signal that girl sent,"I went on a date with a girl from one of the dating apps. We were gonna meet up for ice cream but when we got there it was cold outside and there was no seating inside so she suggested we get drinks at a bar down the street, which we did. I paid for the drinks and the date was going ok and then after about 30-45 min she asked if I wanted to get ice cream, and I agreed. 

We went to get ice cream and she paid which was pretty cool. The date ended about 30 min later. She texted me the next day saying she wasn’t interested which was fine cause I wasn’t interested as well.

Here’s the thing. I obviously took her suggesting us getting ice cream in addition to drinks and paying as a good sign. Clearly she offered even though she wasn’t interested. This has happened once before where a girl asked if I wanted to get food after we hung out for about 1.5 hours and she paid (after I paid for the initial activity). I wasn’t interested in that girl so I didn’t text her but she didnt text me which makes me think she wasn’t interested as well, so I was confused why she wanted to hang out longer and offered paying.

Now I understand every situation is different but here is my question to you ladies out there. If you were to suggest an EXTRA activity while on a first date and pay for it, is that a sign that you are interested or not?",2019-07-05 18:55:37,4,1,dating_advice

All of the things I’ve been told to try never worked for me. I was just so frightened when I went places by myself that I was just off putting. I have also been on dating apps, and got some matches, even a few dates. But every time I end up getting ghosted. 

What can I do here? I’m becoming disheartened. I keep failing, and I’m becoming terrified I’m going to end up alone. Any and all advice is more than welcome!",2019-07-05 05:12:39,17,11,dating_advice
411,c9genl,pm_me_ur_fave_murder,Bf is mad at me because he thinks i was trying to argue with his family last night. I feel like he’s not excited to be with me anymore.,"I spent the 4th with my boyfriend and his family. He and i have had a weird week, he’s coming out of a depression filled episode so he’s been kind of distant the last few days, which i understand. I wanted to spend the 4th with him and i made that obvious a while in advance. But after the week we’ve had i was sure if it was still going to happen. He did end up saying that if i wanted to come over i could, that was earlier in the day. We had a decent morning dialogue and everything seemed back to normal until maybe 2ish. Then he kinda stopped texting me all together. Fine whatever he’s with his family. He did end up texting me again asking if i was coming over and i said “you sure you still want to hang?” And he said “yeah if you want, but if you want to just stay in town i get that” i know i should take his word for it but the whole vibe was off about us this whole week and i just figured he’d be more enthusiastic about seeing me. (We haven’t seen each other for a few days due to work and then i get my child tomorrow so I’ll be busy for a week and a half). So whatever i go up to his parents house because i miss him. I get there and he doesn’t greet me right away, hardly seems excited to see me at all, doesn’t even hug me or anything. His dog was more excited to see me than he way lol. I don’t make a big deal about it, i have a few beers and hang with his fam. 

Then we drove down the street to watch the fireworks. I could tell he was in a bad mood, and he admitted to being in one but wasn’t sure what brought it on. This is where the story gets worse. His family (including him) is very conservative. His brother was making jokes about “recognizing your privilege” and stuff like that, truly being passive about it and being funny (i thought). Then he started in about how “back in the day the men fought and women stayed home” kind of joking and not trying to be rude but also was just giving a “history lesson” of WW1 i was JOKINGLY saying things like “yeah that’s where the women belonged” and then he mentioned that a lot of people had slaves back then too. I made some stupid comment that i honestly don’t even remember, but it was along the lines of “what’s the difference between slaves and women? Neither one had any rights” that’s NOT word for word what i said, but it was along those lines. I DID mention to my bf the detention camps and that whole situation going on to which he said “that’s not happening. I haven’t read anything about it so it’s prob not true” and that upset me so i told him to not be “ignorant about what’s going on in this country that you ride so hard for” and i could just tell that made him mad 

So we get back to his house and i ask what’s wrong and he said “i don’t appreciate you fighting with my family. We have different views and opinions on things and i don’t need you to argue with my mother and brother about that shit. I’ve dealt with gf’s fighting with them before and i won’t do it again. I’m sure they’re all thinking ‘oh great he’s dating another argumentative girl’”. So i apologized and told him that i GENUINELY was not trying to argue with his family and that if he wanted i would reach out and say so myself. But he just wouldn’t let it go. He was pissed about it all night. He went on and on about how “different we are and everything was perfect before. We used to have fun together and now this whole week has ruined everything. Why are you even dating such an ignorant guy who’s family is racist?” He’s putting word in my mouth at that point, I’ve never bad mouthed his family like that. And i did apologize for calling him ignorant, it was rude and i should have worded it differently. But i do think it’s lame that you ride for 45 but don’t know what he’s doing to people in this country. I did also bring up him not sounding like he wanted me over and how his actions toward me didn’t make me feel very welcome and all he had to say was “i didn’t want to pressure you”. If i didn’t want to be there i wouldn’t have gone. 

We never really made up. We fought until midnight and i work today, so i finally just said “should i go home or can we stop fighting for the night?” And he said “let’s just stop” and the we cuddled and went to bed. I woke up before he did and left. We’re probably going to fight some more this morning whenever he wakes up and I’m not too stoked about it. 

I knew going into this that we had different political views.. but i any other time we talked about it we seemed to see eye to eye about most things. Maybe i was just romanticizing him and looking past the things i didn’t like. But now i don’t know what to do. Right answer would be to probably break up (not just solely off this incident there’s other factors coming to head). I do enjoy my time spent with him. We laugh a lot. We have fun. He’s one of the funniest people i know. Dating sucks hahah.",2019-07-05 14:13:21,4,2,dating_advice
412,c9f4v3,pauiieee_,I(27f) am dating a bad texter(27m),"Yeah, so I met this guy over a dating app,we went on 3 dates already and he would always set them up. third date we were basically together for 24hours,
,he treated me for a movie, celebratory dinner for finishing my exams and drinks. He also kissed me on the third date.
Things were really fun when we're together. The problem is that he's really bad at replying. I'd send him a msg in the morning, read receipts would be after a couple of hours but he won't reply until 9-11PM. While I think it's because he's working hard(works at a big company etc), also bit of a nerd;I get so frustrated with the amount of communication we have. The only bright side is that when he replies, it would be a really long msg detailing stuff that happened to his day, reply to what I messaged him about in the morning.
I feel like he messaged me more before we met than after we actually met. 
He admits he's a bad texter, and when we were together on our third date not once did he really took his phone out, he would only take it out when he needs to look up an address where we would go, and I'd see that he doesn't even have any message notifications. He was setting up another date for us for next week but the event we wanted to go to was booked out so he moved it in the next 2 weeks, but he's setting up another thing we could do next week instead. I don't know if this dude likes me or what, it's just a bit frustrating not being able to talk while we're not together. I'm not clingy but I sometimes feel like i'm gonna get ghosted soon. haha

Any advice on how I could deal with this? I've never went on a date with someone who's a bad texter, it's really hard to pinpoint if he's interested in me or nah.",2019-07-05 11:59:23,11,4,dating_advice

I personally thought we vibed pretty well. We've known each other for 3 months now and used to text a lot but currently he hasn't texted me back the last time so I took it as a sign that maybe he lost interest in me, idk. Although, before we stopped texting he actually did bring up how ""we should do this and that"" and I said sure, but we haven't got the chance to do those yet since he hasn't been in town recently due to his circumstances, and is hardly ever in town. He still replies to my ig stories though so I'm guessing maybe he hasn't actually lost interest in me??? 

So I've been thinking I should ask him where he thinks we're going with this because it's killing me but I have reaaally bad anxiety and I'm just super scared to even ask him this straight up.

419,c9i9zi,ihavenoideawhatshapp,Am I reading the signs wrong?,"Hi there,

I have this guy who I work with and I am crushing hard all of a sudden. 

He always walks over to my desk and will pull a chair next to me and we just talk. He makes me laugh all the time. I feel like I’m 16 again when we’re talking. 

We just went on a weekend trip with some of my friends. He tried to grab my hand to help me up the stairs and I pretended I didn’t notice. He bought me a drink, but then I bought one for him even when he insisted I didn’t😭

Then later we were at a bar and he was going to get me another drink and he remembered what I liked from a conversation I had with another coworker months ago....he pretended he just guessed, but I know he was ease dropping on that convo. Plus, he remembered it the exact way. 

But the point is he always made such an effort to come to my desk and talk. He invited me to his party, and I never went though.  We were texting yesterday, but now he hasn’t answered and I’m not at work today.  

I’m scared that I shut him down and sent the wrong signs to him, when I really am interested. I was engaged and it ended 6 months ago and I’m ready to start to date, but this wall is up and I don’t want to miss out on something special, because I am too blind to see if he actually likes me. 

If he was into me, wouldn’t he want to continue texting me? I won’t see him at work til Monday.

Met this  white, petite mixed girl with long curly light brown hair,dirty blondish hair at a club with her sister right before closing like a week ago.  We talked.

## I told her I came alone and am sober so I am pretty awkward so to not mind it. It was her sisters birthday. Anyways I tell her to follow me on IG. She does and I don't follow her back. She said she was here in my city as a assistant director for a show. I tell her I should give her a massage for her sisters bday, she says no thank you

## My IG is pretty unique and silly with also some older shirtless ab selfies with a dick print. i SENT her a DM, ""Hey it was great meeting you trouble, It was cute you went out for ur sisters birthday lol"" no response. Sent a photo of my eye which girls tell me is attractive captioned with something which i forget.. No reply

## Then a couple days before the 4th of july I sent I believe a selfie of my body, with a light boner making my dick print in my underwear really big ""Come have chardanay on my romantic rooftop that we aren't allowed on. VIP shit girl"" Again she seen it but doesn't reply

## So at 1 fucking AM on the 4th of july she LIKES the photo I already sent a day or two ago, after she already seen it.  I think that was a que that she wanted to be invited over to Fuck.

431,c9axdx,Vapowax,Would it be too weird if I (26f) offered to take a friend's (30m) virginity?,"He has been a great friend of mine for a really long time and he is a great guy. He has had basically zero luck with dating through his whole life and never had a girlfriend. Which is crazy to me since he is such a sweet guy. A while ago he asked me to help him review his dating profiles, which I did but nothing really changed. He later asked me if I might be able to set him up with some friends of mine. I don't really have many friends left who are still single but I ended up setting up a date between him and one of my single friends (27f). I thought she might be a good match for him and would make a cute couple, and they went on a handful of dates.

Well they didn't work out either and they stopped seeing each other. When I asked my friend what went wrong she said he was nice but a little awkward and she joking said she ""couldn't believe I would try and set her up with a virgin, how desperate do I think she is?"". I honestly got really mad at this that she would rule him out for such a stupid, made-up concept like virginity. We got into a bit of a fight over it and we haven't actually spoken since.

I texted my friend to catch up and make sure he was ok. I saw him at his place and he seemed pretty upset. I told him that it was going to be alright and it was probably just that they weren't quite compatible. He told me that he already knew the reason and she had mentioned the virginity thing. He said it was fine because it was not the first time he had heard it before. This just made me sad and I got a little emotional since he is such a great guy and truly deserves to be happy.

I have been thinking it over pretty much ever since, and I am mulling over the thought of sleeping with him to help him get some experience and ditch the virgin label, and also be more confident. Obviously I wouldn't tell him it was just to take his virginity, and it would be completely his call if he wanted to go through with it. I really want to help him out but I also want to be sure it's the right thing to do and won't cause more harm than good.

433,c9ccl7,throwawaygreyson,The Concept of 'Winning Her Over',"So here's a question for you all about the 'modern dating process' or whatever. 

Is it common that men should have to go on many dates, also potentially many with the same woman in order to have any prospects at all at anything deeper? 

There seems like there's a lot of emphasis on men to do the attracting but what's confusing to me is the fact, aren't the women who are accepting the dates equally attracted to the men they're going out with? 

Basically I guess the idea here is, why should I stick myself out 15 times on the off chance she finally comes around? Seems like an imbalance. 

If I've been on two dates and I like her a lot, if she's ""the one"", shouldn't those feelings be mutual at that point? Or this is just not how courtship works at all? 

I'll be the first to admit I'm a bit inexperienced when it comes to these matters and so dating experts/gurus, please shed some light!",2019-07-05 05:52:13,13,5,dating_advice

We also have a bunch of mutuals. Hit it off very well. He asked for my number etc. We both were in different states so couldn’t exactly meet and yet would be in constant contact. I eventually realised I was always the one messaging first, but he would always hold proper and interesting conversations and the constant flirting whenever I would message. And then the convo died.
Now he is back in my State, I messaged him something lame, he replied very well but the convo died again. It’s been almost a month.

He's nice, sweet, and a little older than me. We met on Bumble and texted for about 2 weeks. We were both too busy to hangout, and our conversations just started to get less interesting and I noticed he kinda stopped chasing me. He wouldn't respond to my snapchats, and then I finally said ""It's obvious you don't want to get to know me anymore, good luck with everything."" He opened the snaptext and then didn't respond. 

That was a week ago.

Yesterday, he sent me a snap of him doing something with friends, and was checking all of my social media. 

I like this guy a lot. He's my type and I feel like we'd go great together if we actually met in person and didn't just snap/text all the time. I feel like it's hard to really get to know someone through a screen. Also, it's hard for me to show my personality through text, and I imagine it is for him too.

He's a PhD student and been quite busy lately and we live an hour away, so we only meet once a week. He went away for 3 weeks recently but we never had the exclusivity chat before he left. He's back now and said he's going to be busy for his thesis over the next week.

The problem is that texting him is a bit strange. He texts me a huge paragraph once a day and won't reply until same time next day. I'm ok with not texting as much but sometimes it's nicer to be spontaneous. He would be online and just not read my message. It got me wondering why; if he's a poor texter or just playing hard to get or just feels obliged to send me a text a day.

He's affectionate when we're together but really standoffish in public. He's met my friends and they seem to like him.

I don't know if I'm over thinking things because I probably like him more than he likes me. But I'm starting to feel that he's just dating me out of convenience or for the sex until someone better comes along. Should I be patient and wait for a week to talk about things?

449,c9d846,Alphabethur,"I (m17), fell deeply in love with one of my best friends","Hello everyone!
I have a really awesome friend, I met about 2 years ago when we were assigned in the same class. Our friendship never was that strong. Until both of us graduated. That's about a week ago. We promised each other to keep in touch. Since then we met each other often through birthday parties and doing bbqs at public places. When I met her, after half a year she had a boyfriend, who is another friend of mine who also got assigned to that same class. He was her boyfriend until 2 weeks ago. She broke up because she wasn't comfortable with his personality anymore. He always had a grades and therefore was really arrogant, which she couldn't stand after a while. But like she is, she felt bad and blamed herself for breaking up, although it was the best for her. So that's when I suddenly really started to care for her. Over the past two weeks we chatted all day every day via whatsapp. I learned much more about her. Now about her personality. She sadly thinks very bad of herself. She everyday tells me a lot about things like being not good looking, obese, or Being 'socially incompetent'. All those things aren't true. She really is depressed. This comes from a phase which lasted until one and a half years ago, where she hurtled herself regularly, and her friends had to hold her back so she wouldn't jump in front of a train. She did this because she hated herself. She always had these things that gave her bad feedback, and slowly showed herself (in her mind) how of a bad person she was. Like a ballet teacher telling her she was too fat to do ballet. Or being bullied, and having false friends. All this hurt her so much that she lost her self confidence. Today it is better, she doesn't want to jump in front of a train anymore. But she still misses her self confidence. She really has none. That's why she always tells me how bad she thinks she is. I try to tell her the things she says aren't too, and prove it. We have a really deep conversation almost every day. For example when she told me she thought she was socially incompetent, I asked why. She then told me she was very introvert, which I am too. Then I wrote this(warning:long text, I hope everything I state is right):

 if you are somehow in a group in which you don't know anyone but your friend with whom you are here, and you don't get along, so you aren't feeling comfortable, then it is shitty for this evening, but the next day it doesn't matter at all, because you will probably only rarely see them again if at all. Important are the groups you are forced to see more often. For example our music course. There you settle in, just like me, in time. Inevitably. From these groups deep friendships and relationships grow. The only thing that is good for being extrovert and having the ability to settle in quickly, are one night stands. It's like that. You will have even deeper relationships in the long process. Think like this: Being introverted is better. Because extroverted people have no problem to settle in, but to develop deep friendships and relationships.

Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator

I have the feeling she was convinced by that. Also when I told her I had a friend who was extrovert and could confirm this. She only ahs two real friends now. A female friend of her and me.
TL;DR I am trying to build her self confidence and self love again.
During this process, I fell deeply in love with her. Now I am at the point, where I meet her almost every day. Not alone but with friends. I try to touch her occasionally, like when scaring her or e.g. When we were walking home in the dark (which she fears very much) after a BBQ at a public place located in the forest,laying my arm around her shoulders. I try to keep eye contact, but she often looks away. I try to make her think of me as an potential lover. But I think she doesn't notice those signals. I also want to give her time and ask her out in about two weeks, when I think she fully recovered of her break up. Until then I try to see her as often as possible, and 'fix' her.
Thank you for reading this far! I know it is a long text and I am deeply sorry for any mistakes I made while writing this. My English isn't very good.
So do you have any advise on how I could maybe give her more obvious signals and make her interested in me. Or tips on how I could teach her  self confidence again.
Thank you! I appreciate every help!",2019-07-05 07:43:08,5,2,dating_advice
450,c9eui3,randomcherrycoke,She takes days to respond but seems Really into me.,"Been on 6 dates with this girl. I’m really into her but trying not to get ahead of myself. We haven’t had sex but we’re heading in that direction. 

Anyway she seems to like me, but sometimes days pass before she responds to me. I’m the type of person that might read a message within a few hours, but not respond for a bit longer because I don’t have the time. She doesn’t even read them it seems. 

I know I should ask her, but apart from this things seem good. I can’t shake the feeling that if she was really into me, she’d at least want to see what my message says. Who doesn’t check their phone in the morning or evening?! 

We discussed if we were seeing other people and it didn’t seem that way. Well kinda. She said she hadn’t really had a lot of time for things like that lately. This was on our first date...",2019-07-05 11:23:33,2,1,dating_advice

We flirt, talk all the time and generally have good chemistry. I never really thought of her as anything other than a close friend but I've started to develop feelings for her. It just happened and I'm annoyed as I know it could complicate everything.

I recently thought she might have feelings for me also as we have become more affectionate towards each other. (more hugging, touching ect) however today she was going on about she got this guys number and saying how hot he is ect. She said she won't pursue anything with him though as he's not her type. 

However this conversation put me in a real bad mood and I don't feel like talking to her because of it. I feel like keeping my distance from her right now to stop my feelings getting hurt. However she keeps asking what's wrong and I know it will damage our preexisting relationship.

I know you're probably thinking ""just tell her how you feel"" my issue is I have very low self esteem. If I get rejected I will never talk to her again. It will hurt too much.

I asked if she wanted to go on a date and she politely rejected saying that the timing was bad as she had only just got out of a relationship, which is completely understandable. We continued texting and seeing each other at social events over the next few months and we started bumping into each other randomly, which was quite pleasant. I decided to suggest going out again.

She said she thought we get on really well and did consider giving it a chance between us but that she's recently started seeing someone else and it's going quite well and she wouldn't want to go on a date for that reason. 

Now of course, shit happens. Seems like she has been honest with me, which I can only appreciate. Whilst I am disappointed I accept that we can't always get what we want.

The problem I am having though is that I can't help but take it personally. By that I mean I have started asking myself 'well wtf does this guy have that I don't?' and 'what am I lacking?'. I am pretty aware of my thoughts and I understand this isn't the best and most healthy way of thinking. At the moment though, I can't seem to shake these thoughts.

455,c9cv8x,lemon779,How to deal with ex flirting with other girls when I'm there,"I routinely accidentally bump into my ex. We do share a couple social circles so I expect to see him there but there have been times where I have 100% not been expecting to see him and then wham! he's there! 

Like today, I went somewhere that I wasn't expecting to see him. And he was there and chatting with another girl. He eventually got this girl's number.... I had to leave after seeing that. I probably should have just stayed and pretended like I didn't see it....

There was actually a time shortly after we broke up that I think he was trying to make me jealous by flirting with another girl. I completely ignored this and just continued what I was doing. I know he did it to get my attention though. It was obvious because later he ignored this girl.

This time though, it has been a few months since the breakup so it is probably genuine. I just really wish he didn't do it while I was there. Luckily, he probably didn't even notice me much.

It is my fault really. I have been so hurt since the break up that I have almost always ignored my ex. For context, he did break up with me twice over a text so I think I have some right in doing so. He probably thinks I was so upset with him that I moved on ages ago. But really I still have feelings and I am still hurt. I don't know what to do anymore.",2019-07-05 06:56:57,12,2,dating_advice

 So the background of our relationship. So my girlfriend and I have known each other for maybe 3 years. We were like okay friends for the past 2 years. Then for about a year and a half have been really good friends. We've been dating for 4 months we had a very strong relationship but then she had to go to Africa for a mission trip.

 She had been really moved by this mission trip to Africa and that the next couple of weeks would take her a bit to readjust and that the trip has changed her. So I really did just that I asked her what I could do to help, and she told me what I could do and I did the stuff she told me. It's been almost 3 weeks, it's like she has no time, no care, or loves me. But then there will be like a day where she seems to care about me and we text eachother gnight and that we love each other. Then the next day we send like maybe 6 text messages to eachother and I have to almost beg for her to answer questions. I love her so much, but I'm so stressed that she either found someone else or fell out of love with me put of nowhere. 

The situation, currently I am waiting on a mission trip that she told me I should go on, and it would be a great experience(like 3 months ago). I'm worried that she feels obligated that she has to be with me until after this mission trip so that I dont skip out on it. I want to confront her, but she has also been super busy so I dont know if shes just been super busy or what, and she is currently enjoying a family vacation.

463,c9c7be,QueenMelaninJay,I (18F) like my coworker (18M) but I’m unsure if he likes me back. Let me explain....,"So, I recently came to the conclusion that I have a crush on my coworker. I also recently got closer to my coworker and it all started with a hug. I was helping one of my friends ( that I work with) close that night and the guy was walking by. I decided, right at that moment that I wanted a hug from him so I stretched my hands out and he had no problems coming closer and getting a hug. From then on, I’m always getting a hug from him. 

I did end up talking to him and let him know that if he didn’t feel comfortable with my hugs then he could always let me know and he said that the hugs are fine. We did end up talking more. He talked about his life and relationship status and the hurt he’s gone through in the past. He also mentioned that he was too busy for a relationship since he works a lot (I do too so I understand) but if it comes, then so be it. So back to the hugging thing. 

Every time we work together, I get a hug from him. I tend to give my friendly hug. I go in and we move side to side. It’s very warm and fun. Let me tell y’all. He gives such good hugs. He’s always warm and he’s built like a man (😂😂). But I have a feeling that he wants a different kind of hug. 

A few days ago. We worked the morning together. I got a hug from him that morning and later that evening, I clocked out and just stayed to talk with friends. I then ended up asking one of my managers for a free dessert and my crush walked by and asked if I would share some with him, I said sure. So I get my dessert and he’s clocking out. So I’m at the clock out counter with him, putting his half of the dessert in a to go box. 

He then turned to me and said, “ Give me a hug before I go.” It sounded kind of like a question but at the same time not a question. Like he was gaging to see if I would. So I said okay and went in for a hug. I did my usually kind of friendly, lean side to side hug and I heard him chuckle. But it was a weird one. I can’t explain it. I felt like there was some meaning behind the chuckle. I’m trying to stop the friendly, side to side hugs and just go for hugs, not like regular hugs but read his body language and follow type of hug. 

So I’m looking for advice on if he likes me and if I should proceed. Because I feel like he likes me but I’m not sure. If you need additional information, then let me know.

Over the course of the semester we had some pretty good chats before the lessons. The problem was, I learned that she had a boyfriend shortly after I met her. She sent me a friend request on Facebook and I remember that she either had her relationship listed on her profile or she had a photo with the guy.

&amp;#x200B;

We haven't met or spoken since the end of the semester (January), and I actually don't know her that well. She is also no longer a student at my uni, so there is no chance that I would see her by some chance in real life.

&amp;#x200B;

Some time ago I looked at her Fb profile and realized there is no longer anything listed there hinting at her having a boyfriend. She has parts of her profile set as private so it could easily just have been her thinking her relationship status is her business, and setting it as private.

It's not totally unusual for plans we make to not end up happening but usually it's for nonspecific just like I'll call you Saturday night or whatever kind of thing that just never happens, but when we have a solid plan for a day and time then I'll actually plan around that. Recently I've been pretty busy with work so it's been hard to find the time to hang out. I usually work Monday through Saturday second shift til 10pm and it's a 45 min drive home so once I've actually gotten home let the dogs out and had like a minute to unwind it's already too late for anyone who has work in the morning to just start the night with me.
       The week in question I was doing some training so I got to go in 6am to 2pm for half the week, so for the first time in a year in change without having to take a day off to do something I'd actually be around in the afternoon which was pretty exciting for me. We planned for Wednesday when she got out of work at 4 cause her daughter was going with her dad and she had the next day off so she'd have no restrictions essentially. Now for the stupid part, the day before we were supposed to hang out her friend tagged her in some ""Keanu Reeves just got even more epic because he's crashing random weddings now"" meme or some dumb bullshit so they could drool over him and I commented something like after this past month of everybody on the internet randomly worshipping him for no real reason I'd be happy if I never saw or heard from him again, she mad reacts to the comment so I sad reacted to her comment about how Keanu is great or whatever then she just comments stop it, which she's never said to me before ever under any circumstances and not like a haha stop it. Real smart and funny thing for me to do right? I'll admit it was a very backhanded joke and I was kind of taking a jab at her because she's not normally one to hop on the bandwagon of stuff like this. Doing it on social media was inappropriate and I kind of shat on her fun for no reason so I could absolutely understand why she'd not exactly be happy with me despite it being over such a dumb thing. 
        The morning we're supposed to hang out her sister K (30F) texts me at 11:30am and asks what I'm doing tonight and if I want to go over her house because R was planning on going at 5:30-6 which was kind of a surprise so I told her I thought I had plans with her already. Plus under any other circumstance she'd be under the impression I was working, so R obviously talked about my schedule change at some point for K to even be texting me to ask to hang out. K just said something like oh R double booking all the time, maybe she forgot? Which is also weird because they must've not talked about how she had plans with me but then like why are you texting me right now if that's the case cause otherwise you'd think I was getting out at 10? I said no thanks to the offer anyway because she lives an hour away from me and I'd have to leave her apartment at like 7:30 8 to get home and get to sleep early enough get up for 4:45 to make it to work for 6.
       So the rest of the day goes by and I hear nothing from R at 4 when she gets out of work and I start getting annoyed with the entire situation because I just have no idea what's going on at this point. I wait til 6 and text her and apologize for being an asshole and really didn't mean to hurt her feelings. She can just be real with me and talk to me whenever she has an issue with me and whatever stupid thing I say doesn't mean your thoughts are totally invalid if she disagrees, I'd never think anything she thought or felt wasn't worthwhile. But moving forward I would appreciate it if you could let me know if you change plans on me even if you're upset. She calls me like a half hour later but I was going to the store so texted her that I'd call her later. Then she texts me this ""Are you talking about the Keanu Reeves shit?!? Omg I know you're not serious lmao I was just fucking with you when I said stop it lol K sprained her knee and needs an MRI so I am going to her place tonight to help her with shit around the house. I'm definitely still around tomorrow but I got called into work to host trivia tomorrow cause the normal guy is in the hospital. So I'm super nervous to do that but I'm around all day until like 6. Also K asked if you wanted to come with her to trivia to support me lol I have such stage fright it's insane. Anyways yeah just give me a call later and we'll talk about it.""
       So now I know she's just lying to me, K just forgot to mention that she was so injured she needed help around the house and maybe that was the reason R was bailing on me? But like why would you do that I just got done telling you that I wouldn't think any less of you even if the truth was like the stupidest thing ever? A couple more texts go back and forth getting a little more heated because she keeps saying nothing was ever wrong she doesn't know what I'm talking about and she's not mad. So I tell her I assumed she was mad because that would be the favorable alternative to her just blowing me off without any warning for no reason. She's locked into denial of any wrong doing so she says she was going to text me and let me know she couldn't hang out after work but I knew she was already at K's apartment. I told her she had plenty of time to let me know she didn't want to hang out and was kind of a dick about it but it's hard to keep being nice to someone who's obviously lying straight to my face. She just responds with well thanks that's nice and that's the last thing I heard from her a week ago. I went and dropped some stuff off at her house yesterday, she didn't respond to my texts so I just left it on her porch. I feel pretty terrible, I didn't want to blow up our friendship but I don't know what else to do. Did I go overboard?",2019-07-05 09:14:46,5,1,dating_advice
467,c9a9mv,Simoe5,I’ve been feeling really discouraged from dating because I have had absolutely zero luck ever. How can I get past this?,"I have been single my entire life, and I’m not one of those people who complain about being single while also not doing anything about it. I go to the gym everyday. Have plenty of hobbies, I play guitar, I hang with friends, I like shooting pool, I love woodburning. And many more. So I’ve been “focusing on myself” for my entire life. I’ve asked out plenty of women, and have always been shut down. I’m only 21 so I know I’m young and there’s no rush but the loneliness is starting to really get to me.

I honestly feel like I’m going to be single my whole life, and I don’t want to be. I’ve always been that friend who was always single, and everytime my friends ask me why I just don’t have an answer. For the longest time I thought it was because I was ugly. So I hit the gym, started looking better and it never changed anything. My friends tell me I’m not ugly and that I’m handsome but I doubt they’d tell me if I was.

Then I thought well maybe my personality isn’t the greatest. Which is why I picked up a bunch of different hobbies. Got generally happier and it helped with my mental health a lot but I still can’t get past this loneliness. 

I try to meet new people all the time, and I try to be friendly but it never helps. All of this really pushes me away from dating and it kinda sucks.

Does anybody have any advice for getting past this point in my life? My family thinks I’m gay because I haven’t brought a girl home, and that really crushes me. I’m not gay, I’m just a dude, and I just want to share my life with someone. I want someone who will care about me but it seems like no one ever does.",2019-07-05 01:39:28,13,4,dating_advice

469,c9dr1p,piropanther,Some much needed help,"So this may take a while of your time but I want you to hear me out. All my life, I’ve been completely alone when it comes to the dating scene and now I feel like trying anything will set me up for failure. I’m (M18) going into college soon and my high school experiences are atrocious yet painful for me. 

Starting freshman year I had no idea how to talk to girls but I never thought of myself as a weirdo because I got along with everyone and I mean everyone (even other girls). I started thinking about dating the summer after my sophomore year which means I was about 16 at the time. I started getting strong feelings about girls who I didn’t really know well but because of what I had heard about them or their charisma. I never thought about looks when it came to liking a girl but I guess it did play as a factor because those girls would end up with jocks and other meatheads who only dated them for such things. I didn’t let it get to me until the following summer when my preparations for asking out a girl were in place and to my surprise I was once again heartbroken, very very badly. I’m not sure why I get such strong feelings about a stranger girl who I don’t really know but feel like they’re the one (if that makes sense) The thing about me is that when I like a girl, I LIKE them and I cannot stop thinking about them and all that. But the problem is, I don’t know them well which leads me to getting rejected constantly. Another thing in today’s society is that if you get rejected by a girl, your friends will make fun of you, the girl might, her friends definitely will, and pretty soon the whole school will know, and then you cannot like anyone else because you are branded “th at rejected loser”. 
Now 18 and going to college this fall, I want to know how to not get attached to someone so easily and how to approach someone without being pushy while also letting me know their first impression about me based on their psychological reactions to my presence. 

Thank you for reading my story, really feels good to get it out.",2019-07-05 08:58:55,1,1,dating_advice

Mainly just people wanting to hookup. I got a really nice message from one guy, the next city over. We decided to swap phone numbers and text. He asked for (normal pics) that I didn’t have on pof. Sent him a lot got a lot of compliments. Things heated up. We set a date to hang out, met at his place. Had sex. Okay so whatever lol. Before meeting up I asked what he wanted out of this, and he said if all goes well and we clicked he’s open to a relationship. Great me too. I happen to really like him(not just for sex he’s so sweet!) he’s texted me daily since, tells me good night good morning and checks in if he hasn’t heard from me. But I’m lost, every time I bring up being into him he responds with just an emoji. Literally said earlier I want to know him on a more personal level, I got a winky face and then he asked for nudes. Didn’t even acknowledge what I was saying. After we had sex we cuddled for like 45 minutes and just talked. Not like a typical hookup. What the hell do I do?! I really like him, I’ve tried to tell him. Is he just nervous ? How do I even approach this? Lol please be kind. Like I said I’ve never had to do this before


UPDATE: I heard from him like twice today and decided to just let it go, he’s obviously NOT interested in a relationship.

473,c9dh0x,throwaway_starky,Am I being too picky with dating?,"I'm a mid 20s guy, only ever had one girlfriend. That relationship lasted only a year, but it was honestly, apart from a few issues, the best time of my life. Me and her clicked on so many levels and when we broke up 2 years ago now it broke us both. We're on good terms now, but moving on has been difficult.

A year after we broke up, I started dating again. Met girls a variety of ways: in person, dating apps etc. but I've noticed that I never get passed the first date. Not because they didn't like me or anything, even if I've had a great time I've always messaged them afterwards saying I had a good time I just didn't think we'd be a good match. But, that's always been after one date.

I'm just concerned that I'm holding the girls i meet up to an impossible standard. Maybe I'm trying to immediately replicate what I had with my ex. Is that insane? I'm not a fan of dating just for the sake of being in a relationship, if I'm getting into a relation it's because I see potential. Is that the wrong view to take? Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking at them thinking ""yeah I could marry you"". I date something because I think we are a good match, I just think that perhaps I make a judgement too early. I think a major part of it as well is that in overly concerned about what other people in my life may think.

I learned some things about her, but couldn’t really talk to her thanks to other people who were in on the conversation. Most of what I learned was kind of started and finished story wise, so I feel it would be weird to bring those things up. Also I’ll add there’s a bout a 9 year age gap (me being M/29, and her F/20), and that makes it harder to think of things. I also have bad social anxiety when it comes to talking to women I’m interested in, and have issues of thinking of things to ask, or say.

I think she's given the signals to advance? I'm gonna go with yes she has, if for no other reason than its given me some confidence to ride. She's several points ahead of me in appearance.

Oddly, I'm not too worried about rejection. We're adults and as long as I'm not creepy about it, life goes on. We're on the level of management and work at different sites in the same metro. Our responsibilities do intersect. 

I love this job. We're in animal care which has its perks including a supportive culture if not overly sensitive sometimes. Its probably 80% women so there is some anxiety about gossip. The larger fear I have is some loss of credibility and/or questions of integrity in the way I would have to work with her site's resources. 

I've never asked a coworker out. I don't even really know how these things are perceived from the outside. How do you gauge risk:reward? In a female dominated environment, how do you as a guy distinguish between natural competitive flirting and actual subtle green lights?

482,c9a866,macrowaffle8,How should I approach asking out this girl in my Summer class?,"I'm taking a Summer class at a community college and have a crush on this one girl who I've barely talked to, but we're on good terms, but it's not like we're really friends either. I'm 19 and literally have never had the balls/conservation skills to ask a girl out (I did have a gf a yr ago but that's because she completely engaged it and the relationship sucked cuz I didn't like her in the first place). I figure it's really premature to just honestly kind of randomly ask her out at the end of class as we're walking out but my logic is I've got nothing to lose. She'll likely say, ""I have a boyfriend, sorry"" or some form of ""I don't even know you that well, but thank you"", but even so this will be a huge boost to my confidence if I am just able to pull this off in the first place. I've got a mild speech impediment (stuttering and lisp) so as long as I can ask her out relatively smoothly I'll be fuckin happy.

I was thinking the best way to do it would be something like, ""Hey Catherine, I know this is a bit weird, but..I'll just get straight to the point, I think you're cute, and I want to take you out to see x movie this Friday."" First of all, do you guys think I should have a different approach? Second, is the movie a good spot to ask about, I know the movies are a subpar first date spot, but I don't really care, I just want an activity that I'll be able to easily propose to her. Third, please don't give some general words of encouragement or say ""Just go for it bro!"", I know you guys (and gals) aren't full of shit, if u have experience or u think I need to do something different, please fucking tell me, I appreciate it!

484,c9d0q9,Ravenclaw92,I feel like a completely broken person and I don’t know if I will ever recover in this lifetime.,"There are a lot of things, involving aspects that correlate towards my career, my family life (sense of belonging), and my love life:

For whatever reason, I subconsciously assume that there will always be someone better than me, in ANY situation; one specific example is me feeling inadequate in the bedroom. A lot of life experiences has opened my eyes for me to make this realization.

I’m a non white person who was born in a white family and society. Subconsciously, I’ve had identity issues because of that. I’ve always felt different and it seems that by having my family members not discussing me being different, it has backfired in the long run. 

No one is to blame. However, even if we do have a talk about it, they cannot possibly empathize how I’ve felt throughout most of my life because they’ve never gone through a similar experience. I CONSTANTLY feel lonely no matter what. 

In high school, I’ve wanted to go to grad school in the same profession that my adopted father was in because I looked up to him, in addition to avoiding any or all subjects that I hated (such as math); which helped bolster my decision. Eventually, I made it to the grad school of that profession, then I flunked out because somewhere along the line I didn’t have the right motivation or reason to make it though that profession: what ‘I thought I wanted’ is not the same as what ‘I know I wanted’. That’s what screwed me. I love exercise, I love nutrition, and I love living a healthy lifestyle. I knew this, even before I went to the profession. However, I could not come to terms of going through a program or taking classes that involved these subjects because they included topics that involved the hard math and sciences I SUCKED at. So logically, I went with the route paralleling towards my adopted father’s profession. It made sense at the time. 

After flunking out, I became lost for a few years. I dived into a long distance relationship for a year and then we shortly broke up (in under a month). A few days ago I masterbated only twice after weeks of breaking up. During these few weeks I met someone new who was funny, nice, outgoing, and very attractive. I told her where I was in life and just recently got out of a relationship. The third night we went out we were having an awesome time. Then, we started heading towards the bedroom, but I had ZERO arousal, even though the exact opposite should have happened. Maybe I’m stressed? Maybe I’m still recovering from my recent relationship (even though I firmly believed I was ready to move on)? Maybe everything was new and moving too fast? It can be any number of reasons....

The point is, there are so many things that have gone wrong in my life, that also could have been missed opportunities. However, the bright side is I’m finally figuring out what I want in life. I finally have a stable job (doesn’t pay much but has benefits) and I’m focusing on what I like, such as training in the gym and building myself physically like I was back when I was a senior in high school. Although, ever since starting this new job I gained a substantial amount of weight in only in a matter of months (which lowered my self esteem a bit; this also could have affected my state arousal). The downside, is that I’m starting to believe I will NEVER be fit for a real relationship. Maybe I’m just one of those people that can only be single forever, even though I don’t want to be. 

A lot of it too is, that in my opinion, the digital age involving social media and online dating apps are only pushing more and more people to seek someone better (such as increasing everyone’s expectations exponentially) and I fear I can never be that ‘better person’ if that’s always the case. 

I’ve been in many relationships and all have failed, with long distance being a large part of the problem. I finally found someone great (who I couldn’t feel any arousal for as I mentioned previously, even though I wanted to) who I really liked but that backfired. She said she also has been presently dating around and historically she’s been in many situations where she was both the rebounder and reboundee. Before this (as I’ve briefly mentioned before), I told her I only want a long term relationship and she wants the same as well. I’m not the casual dating type. She then didn’t think continuing our dates was right because I might need more time to recover (which might be true). By her being honest first hand right off the bat was the best way to go about it though because she found someone who was in a more stable and better place. I understand that, I’m just severely disappointed in myself just now realizing that I’m a broken individual. All I did was increase the expectation while finding out that I, myself, cannot reach that goal at this point in time (being with a type of person I’ve always wanted to be with).  Also, I don’t even know how to place what I truly like (health and fitness) into a sustainable and long term career path. 

I don’t know what true happiness is or where to find it. 

I feel broken and lost. 
I feel like I can never be as happy as I want to be. 
I do not know what to do.
I feel like I’m always lost and confused. 
Worst of all, I feel I’m the only person on this entire planet feeling this way and I’ve never felt more alone and disappointed with myself. 😔",2019-07-05 07:16:07,1,1,dating_advice

But she was hooked up on our chats, herself started conversations many times, tried to playfully tease me, etc, etc. She even said that my ""flirting game is too good"". IDK what to make of that, but just mentioning it here.

&amp;#x200B;

Now comes her birthday. I wished her, we had long chats. Due to some reasons, I logged in to Instagram in one of my friends (not 'A') phone and forgot to log out. He chatted with my crush as me, and insisted on giving her some gift on her birthday and somehow it came as a creep to me too. It was like I was trying to flaunt my money.

2 days later, she unfollowed me to form all social media platforms. I didn't know why she did that, and assumed the money incident as a reason. and I didn't clear things with her, because I just didn't care although I still liked her. Now, she talks to my friend 'A', and argues with him as he didn't tell her how was 'X' as a person. 'A' got confused and told her what 'X' taught the reason was that she stopped any communication. 

At this point, she stops talking to 'A'. I still didn't care, and thought to not think about the situation and respect her decision to not talk to me. 

2 days later, she approaches me in the class, and asks to talk to me outside about something. She tells me that she isn't angry or hurt by me but was just angry with 'A' for some reason (bullshit).  BUT SHE still didn't mention what I actually did and why she stopped talking to me and at that point, I didn't ask her.

&amp;#x200B;

I had an neck surgery after this day and went to class after 2 weeks and this girl didn't even ones came to me like others did to ask what happens to my neck ( Some medical dressing was done.)

&amp;#x200B;

**This is the part where I need your help. If she didn't wanna talk to me, why she came to me to clear things up by actually lying and not clearing things with me.** ***You know how we have heard that if a woman approaches its a good sign,*** this is what got me confused:

* Why clear things up when she stopped talking to me and hasn't talked to me after trying to clear things up?
* Why did she stop talking to me in the first place?
* does she want me to approach her again?? and some more questions.

Now, look, I'm not a bad looking guy, and have scored many beautiful girls than 'Y'. Nor I have ever come off as a creep. I showed my chats to some of my female friends, and they didn't find even the money thing offensive or creep and actually liked my chats.

&amp;#x200B;

Here what I think:

* 'D', her male friend, is either her boyfriend( which she denies) or very close,deep friendzoned guy who somehow manipulated her. this 'D' although is trying to get her as a girlfriend which I'm sure of. I have seen them talk for hours on the phone, and other things that both a male bff &amp; a boyfriend can do.
* She didn't like the ""money"" thing.

NOW please help me, because this thing of her approaching me has got me confused and I need atleast closure on what the fuck happened.",2019-07-05 03:24:05,4,2,dating_advice

487,c9b3nv,tltlx,Should I ask the girl who rejected me what went wrong ?,"I \[M22\] know it sounds pathetic but it's been a week and I still can't get over it and I wanted to know what went wrong during our first date that she rejected me on the spot.

I don't normally believe in Tinder but I matched her 2 months ago, took me 3 week to start a conversation but we managed to have a decent chat, added each other on FB and texted for almost a month. We're not like crazy soulmates or sth but seems like we hit it off and I asked her out on a dinner date. The date was kinda awkward at first but then things got better, she laughed a little and we discussed about our dream travelling destination and our favorite movie ... We ended up staying for more than 1 and a half hours and no one was looking at the phone or acting annoyed. Then when I ask her if she wanted dessert, she said no (then I know sth was wrong) so she ordered an uber and I walked her there.

Right before we parted, I jokingly asked her for the next date then there came the only sentence no men want to hear: ""You are really nice but I can only see us as friends."" It didn't broke my heart but surely I'm surprised that she made up her mind so fast. I got rejected, ghosted, bailed ... before but this is the first time someone rejects me right after leaving the date so I've been cracking up my brain to understand what did I do or say that are so wrong. She haven't unmatch me on Tinder or unfriend me on FB so I'm 5 beers away from texting her to get a reason or even closure.",2019-07-05 03:19:33,6,2,dating_advice
488,c9cx59,birdoandratchet,My (18M) friend (18F) is flirting a lot despite saying she doesn't want a relationship,"About 5 weeks ago I met a girl in my classes and we clicked really well, and us plus one other dude (18M) have been hanging out almost everyday since. However off the start she said she wasn't interested in a relationship due to trust issues from a previous relationship where she was cheated on. She has never showed much sign of interest in a relationship either and has frequently mentioned no interest in a relationship (not directly to me, but just in general). However in the last few days, us 3 went on holiday together and me and her got talking alone a lot and she ended up revealing all this stuff about her troubled past. She told me she has never told anyone these things before either, not even her best friend of 3 years, as she has problems with trust issues and keeping things to herself. Ever since that talk though she has been flirting heavily with me, up to the point where she is coming into my room and cuddling with me on the bed, falling asleep on me multiple times, touching me at every opportunity, constantly resting her head on me, paying lots more attention to me and always trying to talk to me etc. I've always liked her and wanted to ask her out but the constant mention of no interest in a relationship etc put me off, but after the last few days I'm not sure. In any other situation I would have asked her out, but I'm not sure because previously she was so adamant on not wanting a relationship. She hasn't mentioned not wanting a relationship since the talk either which gives me hope, but what should I do? I really like her and would hate to lose her as a friend, I'm afraid she may just have started being more friendly and I'm reading the signals wrong. Sorry for the ramble haha I'm just real confused, is it normal for someone to change their opinion on relationships that fast?

490,c97ory,hx7918,What are some positive qualities and what are some negative qualities that you would suggest to have and not have in a guy?," 

So my main question for this post is, what do women look for in a guy? What are some positive qualities and what are some negative qualities that you would suggest to have and not have in a guy who you're seeking a relationship with?

I ask this because there's this girl at my work who I'm kind of in to. She's 21 and I'm 23 and recently, she only worked on the weekends up until the end of the most recent school year because she's in college. I might be returning to my college after I dropped out 2 years ago at the end of my junior year due to ""personal issues,"" and idk, maybe I could start a conversation with that. I'm trying to find something in common with her because I really like her. She let me follow her Instagram account and she followed me back. Apparently she really likes soccer and the only potential problem with that is that I'm the exact opposite of being called ""athletic."" Also, this is just my personal viewpoint, but I'm just not really interested in sports...unless you consider chess a ""sport."" Lol. (Yes, I know sports need to have at least some physical exertion in order for them to be called a ""sport""...was just making a joke.)

I know that a lot of people would say that getting into a relationship at work is a pretty bad idea, but I'm willing to risk it. I actually like the job that I have now, but if things go awry, I'm willing to take drastic measures, i.e., quit my job. There are even better jobs out there compared to this one, I know that for a fact.

I have a rare opportunity to work with the girl I like this week. We have the same shifts for 4 days. This is potentially my only chance to get to know her and maybe start a friendship. I think I have some potential with this girl as she has already interacted with me in a few *good* ways already.

Personally, I'd like to think that I'm funny, intelligent, and kind. But what do women look for in guys? How do I start a relationship with this girl?",2019-07-04 21:04:57,4,6,dating_advice

493,c9aqk4,aatj887,My(M-18) ex-Crush(F-16) chatted me after a complete month of ghosting me and idk what to do.,"There is a lot of information here. My first language is spanish so sorry for any errors in the text. Lets go back to almost February 2019. I finally decided to tell my crush that I liked her a lot. We exchanged instagram accounts (She didnt have a phone by that time) and talked a lot from there. After that I invited her to a date at a restaurant. It went relatively well and we both said everyone that we got a good time there. I continued to talk with her a lot. We had a second date where we watched Avengers End Game (We actually watched only the last half as she went to the wrong cinema and I had to go for her).

That date was relatively bad, as I met her parents and they seemed they didnt like me at all. Her parents called my ex-crush seven times to her new phone and she didnt answer any of them because of me talking shit with her. This second date was the premiere day of Endgame. About one month passed with us talking more shit, but nothing out of frienship happened. One random day in may, she begins to fight with me via chat, and with no reason tbh. That day the chat ended with her saying: ""I can't continue with this, I feel uncomfortable with you at my side and im too angry to talk with you right now. Ill chat you later."" This message made me feel really angry and sad. I lost the love I had for her.

No chat until the 28th of June (My graduation day), where she chatted me ""Congratulations, you're finally in the university!"" That was the initial message, just after the worst message ever written by her. She says she was ""really angry that day and that she was being mean with everyone"" but I dont think thats true. Some of my friends say that receiving a message from her 1 month after she began ghosting me is a white flag for love, but it seems stupid for me. Equally, I still miss her, and I would love to have her at least for 2 months, before I change my country of residence. Her birthday is the 18th of July, but I dont know if saying her something is a wise decision to take. Should I chat her?, Should I ask her to forgive me?(Although I havent done anything?), Should I ignore her and suffer a bit?

496,c96ja3,Pherrot,Feeling shameful over vein thoughts about my GF’s physical appearance. Am I doing this wrong?,"So I’m seeing a very nice woman, fun, and we have a lot in common. I am the kind of guy that can find any body shape sexy as long as it LOOKS healthy. Looking unhealthy is a huge turn off for me and I’m feeling guilty about it.

I’ve dated and been attracted to skinny girls, curvy girls and everything in between. Ive never dated someone “out of shape” to the point of appearing unhealthy. That seems to be my line. Extra pounds here or there but still healthy, look good, can exercise and can feel good without physical limitations- and I’m fine.

This new girl I’m dating is gorgeous. She has a gorgeous face, I mean absolutely 11/10.  Her body used to be amazing before we met, but due to medical issues she’s on meds that have caused her to gain weight and exercise is painful so she’s eating more and not exercising. She’s recently put on about 50 lbs and lost most of her muscle tone. This has me in an interesting spot where I’m super turned on by her physical appearance while clothed, due to her beautiful personality and face, then immediately turned off when the clothes are off and I see how unhealthy she looks. Her medical condition is going to be life long. She will always require these meds.

I brought up concerns about her health from a medical standpoint and that I was concerned how healthy she would be for our future with those meds and an inability to exercise. 

She wants to get healthy but she’s become “extremely confident” in her body. She’s totally okay with her curves and weight and she’s very proud of it. Which is something she expressed never having before when she was in shape. She’s also mentioned hating how toxic her ex was, even stressing and encouraging unhealthy eating habits. I certainly don’t want her to have an unhealthy anything, especially unhealthy relationships with food.

What do I do? I’m just not physically attracted to her naked body. But she such a pretty person. I feel terrible.

I can’t tell her that I find the extra weight and lack of exercise unattractive or I’m reinforcing that she isn’t beautiful, that’s a dick move.

498,c9cb28,eighty-nines,My friend [30M] only dates younger people [F18-25] with mental illness from a kink site.,"Hey reddit! So - this isn't about me, but a friend of mine, whose dating habits are becoming a little disturbing to me. When we started hanging out a few years ago, he had a girlfriend he had met irl, when they were both studying. They seemed to have a rocky relationship, but that sort of thing happens. They broke up, our friend group comforted him of course.

Then, his dating habits slowly changed. He started dating exclusively online, on an ""international kink site"" he won't disclose the name of. He has a fair amount of mental health issues, mostly anxiety and depression. Nothing wrong with that - but he does tell me that he seeks out other people with mental illness because they ""understand each other better.""

My issue with this started when he fell in love online with an american 18-year old. We live in Europe. He started an exclusive relationship online and stayed up all night, every night to talk to her. Then, after a couple of months, she was apparently going to move in with him in his student accommodation (160 square ft apartment) in our country, because her family was wildly abusive and she wanted to escape. To another country! With a 12 years older boyfriend she had never met IRL! But she never came, and they broke up.

Now he has a new girl, from another european country, who did move into his tiny apartment (which the landlord is yet unaware of). She is a third of his size (no exaggeration) and all alone, staying inside all day because of her crippling social anxiety. Not even his closest friends have met her.

So, please give me some perspective. Am I overreacting by thinking this is unhealthy? Am I moralizing over technically legal relationships? I don't think he would be intentionally abusive - but the arrangements are so, so weird.",2019-07-05 05:47:03,5,1,dating_advice
499,c9can6,HaganeNoStudent,I suck at telling when a girl is into me and I think this one might be,"So there's this girl in my class, we never really talked until one day we had to do a group assignment together and then we started saying hi to each other on the hallways. This one time I got to the classroom earlier and she was there with a couple of friends so I sat next to them, and we ended up talking about school and things her friends had going on. Once class had started I had to leave before the attendance sheet even got close to me so she offered to write down my name.

In another class where I had to do a role play thing my group didn't even try (we were literally reading our script) and she told me ""nice acting"" afterwards with a smile on her face. Now, that's something I would've said sarcastically to a friend but we never even spoke outside of school so I don't know what to make of that, but the fact that I caught her looking at me a couple of times during class makes me wonder. 

Last Tuesday after a midterm, we were waiting for the scores and spent like an hour talking about shit with her and her friends about some personal things (I guess that's good). My friends, who know about this because I asked them too, say that she was smiling the whole time even when I was saying dumb shit.

So, my question is: how do I tell if this is genuine interest or if she's just being friendly?

502,c9c1dd,bookmarkthat101,"Depressed, unemployed exbf (30/m) wants me (25/f) to stay with him during his recovery and says there’s “no point” if I leave","

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c7li5h/depressed\_exbf\_30m\_emailed\_me\_after\_i\_blocked\_him/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c7li5h/depressed_exbf_30m_emailed_me_after_i_blocked_him/)


UPDATE:

I am so exhausted, as is he.

After 1 week of blocking him/no contact and my exbf's friend reaching out to me, desperately begging me to give my ex another chance, today we finally reconnected. And to be honest, I instantly regretted it.

The phone call was toxic on both ends. I had been suppressing my anger and disappointment and got triggered today, and I kind of exploded in angry tears to him at the beginning of the call. He said he was ""stunned"" and just didn't know how to react, and didn't imagine this type of conversation. He was pulling back again, distancing himself emotionally because of all the drama, after all the borderline suicidal, emotionally charged, panic-induced, anxiety-laden emails HE sent ME after I blocked him - which obviously made me worry.

Looking back at the phone call, I feel kind of bad, but I couldn't help it then. I had been suffering and suppressing, too.

One thing I was harsh about.. I yelled at him in tears, ""You should NOT be in a relationship. You should just keep having friends with benefits. You don't deserve me."" (I'm his first GF -- he's had a lot of fwb and one night stands before. In the beginning of our relationship, he told me he found girls boring outside sex in the past. He's literally unable to cope with emotions/serious conversations, doesn't want to deal with/confront problems and SOLVE them, and escapes to video games.)



Today I was going to cut contact again -- this time for good. I was mainly worried he was suicidal from his emails.

Him: ""Are you going to disappear again?""

Me: ""Yes.""

Him: ""I don't want that.""

Me: ""Of course you don't. But this is hard for me too. You don't think about me or care about ME.""

Him: ""I want you to stay with me while I get better \[recovery from depression\]. I'm already getting a little bit better.""

Me: ""But in order for me to stay with you, I have to be 10% of myself. I used to be 100% of myself with you.""

\[Note: I have to be 10% of myself because when he's depressed, I can't be real with him. I can't lean on him for emotional support. I can't be my full, whole self with him. I just can't be transparent with him at all because he is so fragile. I'm forced to only show my ""good"" parts so he doesn't get triggered.\]

Him: ""There's no point"" \[if I leave the relationship\]

Me: ""You have to get better FOR YOURSELF.""


The phone call had to end abruptly because I had to go. Just.. sigh. Please anyone. I can't even tell my family or friends about the reality of this situation because I don't want to humiliate him.

He's unemployed. He quit his last office job because he was getting anxiety (""Is this my job for the rest of my life?"" then got sick for 2 weeks. Came back. Overwhelmed with missed work. Got sick again from the stress. Knew he was going to get fired so he quit first.)

He's a high school dropout and couldn't even complete his last two assignments (recently) to get a diploma because of the depression. As for college, he said ""I don't think I can do it at all.""

He's been addicted to video games his entire life, more or less, even now.


TLDR; Broke up with depressed, unemployed exbf because his debilitating depression and anxiety was severely affecting our relationship and triggered my own aggressive tendencies, despite how ""loving"" I can be -- the ""drama,"" lashing out at him, wanting him to ""get better"" quickly, etc. I finally mustered the courage to block him because this was unhealthy for BOTH of us. He got crazy and sent me three long emails infused with suicidal language and HIS FRIEND even messaged me BEGGING me to give ex another chance. I did give another chance and reconnected. Didn't go well at all. I said I'm leaving (for good) and he said there's no point to his recovery if I leave.

508,c9blzg,Meloxian,I think my female manager likes me and She’s really cool; I’d love to hang out with her I just don’t know if I’d want to have sex at any point.,"Preface - My M19 female manager F19 is pretty cool she has an awesome personality, she’s been super nice recently (for instance helping me do my job when she’s not working as manager). The issue with L is she sleeps around with a lot of guys, and has every std on the planet, jk maybe, but she does sleep around a lot, and although I’m pretty sexually liberal I don’t know If I’m willing to catch anything.

Context (can skip if want) - Me and this girl who I’ll call L have a prior relationship; I went on a couple of dates last year with her younger sister F17 co-worker, but nothing serious and we split on alright terms. I’ve also hung out with L once or twice but mostly during my shift; ex we’d go and get lunch for the office and would eat together (this was last year). Whenever me and L work together we vibe really well; I feel like we’re on a really similar wavelength, and although I vibe alright with most people I feel she and I connect especially well, that’s probably due to her great charisma. 

I know she was interested; (at one point she directly said she wanted to “fuck me in the good way”) but I never asked her out or anything, last summer; I hit her up at one point, but I guess I took too long and she lost interest, whatever. I’ll admit I did and still do have a massive fear of rejection (I never had a relationship through school, although I think my personality is great, Will Smith vibes and I look alright); and it really has hindered me, although I’m definitely much improved from where I was (I started working out etc.)

L ended up getting a boyfriend last fall, I messed around with like 3 people; one for two weeks, one for a couple of months and one for a month. Anyway the last girl ended things with me a month ago, so I’ve been single since then. Recently L’s boyfriend dumped her for some other chick, that’s what she said.

Currently - 
1. L keeps being super nice to me, she does things for me that she doesn’t have to, and when I tell her “thanks, you’re awesome (the same thank you I use on others) she says yeah I know. When I don’t ask her to do these specific tasks she gets upset. 
2. she smiles back when I smile at her (I smile at a lot of people) but doesn’t smile at other people that much. 
3. She keeps conversations going, gives me strong eye contact etc.
4. Called me her favorite person to work with
5. Asked me to touch her neck; she got in a car accident and there were serious scars, although she mentioned they were infected, so I was a bit iffy on that one, also “accidentally” showed me her boob. When she was pulling down her shirt to show me her neck and upper chest. She did all of this unprompted.
6. Seems to be comfortable making contact with me.

The issue - I’m not interested in catching an std and she is the kind of girl who is very sexually active especially with her partner. I would like to hangout with her as friends though, but I don’t want to turn this into a shitshow or give the wrong idea to her. Also her definition of hangout is having sex. Forgot to mention I don’t have a lot of friends that I normally hangout with and am pretty lonely. 

TLDR; female manager likes me, but is very sexually promiscuous and I don’t want to catch an std, or give her the wrong impression, but think I would like to hangout with her, we vibe well and I’m super lonely usually so I want friends. Don’t know how to navigate this situation without turning it into a shitshow as I’m normally not a very direct person. What should I do?",2019-07-05 04:20:20,39,1,dating_advice

512,c97zyg,tyharding2,How to stop putting myself down and highlighting the fact that I've never had sex? (m21),"I think most people will say to keep improving yourself and find hobbies that create happiness in your own life. They'll say that you should value your life on the fact that a woman finds you desirable or not. The main theme I am getting is that keep improving yourself and put yourself in social situations where you meet more people. However, the rare times I ever get in a social situation, I have a hard time displaying obvious interest in a girl I'm attracted to. I have no problem talking to anybody really except a girl I find to be very visually appealing. Talking to co-workers, no problem. Talking to family friends at a barbecue, no problem. Attempting to speak to a girl at a rave that has tried to make eye contact with me, Houston we have a problem. I think the biggest reason why I never show interest or believe that I'll never have sex is based on my high school years. For about all 4 years of high school, I was painted one of the biggest creeps in the school and made fun of on social media by countless people. I'm mature enough to admit that their actions were justified and that I was in the wrong. How did this shape my thinking? Well, after the shaming had been going on for a while I had automatically assumed that no girl in the school would be interested in me, therefore no girl ever would be interested in me. Combine that mindset with me currently never putting myself in social situations and that is how you get a 21 year old virgin. I just wish that I could change who I am, how I think, and honestly how I look. Trying to change my thought patterns is probably the hardest thing I am battling with currently. I actually like going to the gym and trying to change my outer appearance but in my experience, changing the way I see myself is near impossible. Using psychedelics, I have gained perspective on things and have had serious introspection that highlights my weaknesses. But even after the enlightenment, my mind is still welded to my high school experiences. I'll just give you an example of how solidified my thought process is. A couple of months ago, I was hanging out with a couple of cute women around my age. I have no intention of sleeping with either of them due to the fact that are super close to my mother. Anyways, it was just the three of us drinking and then they got to talking about me for a minute. One of them said I was really cute and the other agreed saying I was cute as well. They recommended that I try Tinder and I just kinda shrugged it off, as I should because Tinder is a shitshow. I just thought it was bizarre because I never hear that and honestly I thought they were saying that out of pity. It makes no sense to me because if I was actually ok looking, I probably would have had at least one SO by this time in my life. I honestly believe that I am too inexperienced for me ever to be in a romantic relationship, and also not attractive enough. Whatever, I'll just continue to grind at the gym and at least try to get a grasp on my college career.",2019-07-04 21:34:19,3,3,dating_advice

Women can be players too, that's why a lot of times I stick to average, more plane Jane type of women. I don't go for the hottest chicks I can find always. I think that's your problem, ladies.","I think I have an interesting perspective on this because I'm an ugly duckling type dude. I was always tall, but skinny and awkward for most of my 20's. Now that I've filled out, and I work a highly physical job, I get way more attention from women than I ever did.  


I've been single for about a year now, I've hooked up with a few women here and there. Most have been younger and they have like a  catch phrase ""You're cute/funny but I'm just having fun"" AKA she's a maneater type who can't make up her mind and wants a flavor of the week. 

Sounds like this is the type of guy a lot of women in this sub are dating, don't go for the hottest dude you can find. I mean you don't have to go for a 4'9 balding toothless dude.  I see the dudes that get a lot of attention on Tinder/Bumble.  Fantastic looking, great jobs (usually not working class). Lots and lots of really interesting friends and travel pictures. 

These guys are going to have a lot of choices. I don't even try very hard and these days I seem to have a decent amount of choices, at least from younger women. I can't even imagine what it would be like if I got 300 matches on Tinder/Bumble everyday. That has got to go to a man's head.

514,c98o91,milo1110,Should I (22F) ask a guy (24M) out on a date again if he starts showing sign of disinterest after date 3?,"I met this French guy on Tinder who will be in Japan for about 3 weeks to travel. In the span of one week we have been hanging out for 3 times already. All of them were just dinner and then drinks at the hub but we always ended up being with each other for about 6-7 hours. 

He asked me out for our first two dates and our second date was perfect ( he literally told me that ) so I initiated the third one. While our date 2 was very intimate with him holding my hands most of the time and giving me a French kiss at the end of the date, our third one was kinda platonic and we only held hands on our way back to the station and kissed goodbye. 

After our first two dates, he always sent follow-up texts and initiated conversation, telling me that he wants to talk to me. But after the third one, when I sent him a message telling him I had fun tonight and was glad that we could share a lot things to each other, he just replied with a bland reply “Yes indeed”.

He admitted that most of his relationships were really quick ones ( four months at most ) because he’s moving around a lot, and also because he was not very compatible with his exes.  However, he also told me that it doesn’t feel right to just have sex with me and then leave ( like with his previous Tinder dates ) since he really enjoyed talking to me and it’s been a while since he was able to open up to someone this much.

I’m not really expecting anything serious or commitment from him but I enjoyed his company a lot and I want to have fun while it lasts. Could it be that he starts to lose interest because I didn’t initiate affection and we didn’t have sex even after 3 dates? I actually really want to become intimate with him but because we are both living in the dorms with many people, we don’t really have anywhere private to be with each other. 


Tl;dr : Guy from Tinder showed lack of interest after date 3 even though he was every eager to stay in touch with me after the first two. Should I text him telling him that I want to be more intimate with him and ask him out again even if he doesn’t initiate?",2019-07-04 22:40:34,10,3,dating_advice
515,c98jkj,pixiechickie,CHEMISTRY: How to define it; where to find it!,"I've dated a man who meets all my external criteria. If there were literal checkboxes, he would tick every one, except the elusive chemistry. I enjoy his company, he takes me interesting and nice places, is a perfect host and I can tell he likes me. Recently, he went to kiss me and I recoiled and said, ""I don't want to."" Then I tried to explain the theory of going slowly.

I'm no 18-year old virgin and I assure you if I had found the chemistry I probably would have gone in for the kiss first. I'm very affectionate and love kissing (and sex) but this just didn't feel right. I surprised myself in my reaction actually. 

He later texted me and said I seemed apprehensive about him and he hoped we could foster a more comfortable relationship. I had to have an honest talk with myself and texted him back and told him he was right; I was aloof and apprehensive and that I couldn't assure him I would change in the future. As much as I hated doing it, I broke things off with him knowing how unlikely it will be to meet someone who comes as close to everything I look for in a man. 

Obviously, it's all about the chemistry which I define as sexual attraction. That seems so crude and superficial but I don't think you can overlook the fact if it's not there. This guy didn't repulse me by any means but neither did he excite me.

521,c97a5i,DarthEcho,Am I creepy or does she kinda like me?,"I (F30) saw a girl on the bus a year ago and we have taken that very bus regularly together. We have exchanged a few looks, but it wasn't until a month ago I womaned up and talked to her - nothing more than a casual talk about the future changes in our daily commute.

After the short talk I have taken the liberty of asking to sit with her 3 times.
She clearly loves to listen to music in the morning, but when I asked her if I could sit she turned off her music and we talked  casually about the commute and work.

Last time we took the bus we had a moment where our eyes locked for about 20-30 seconds without a word. 

She had to change the bus she takes, but I can take that one too. Today I waited for her, and I even told her that I enjoyed talking to her. I told her to listen to music if she and I would be quiet, so she listened one on ear only .. 
As the awkward little weirdo I am, I apologized if I came across as creepy (IDK why, I talk to much when I'm nervous) and I even asked her if I made her uncomfortable. She replied that I were free to take wichever bus I pleased while she looked me dead in the eyes.

I really don't know anything about her - she could be gay, straight, whatever age above 23 and I don't even know her name.
All I know is that my pulse skyrocket every time I see her.

I've recently gotten to know a girl better and I think we would both characterise each other as a 'new friend', at least to each other. I also like her. Her texting behaviour, however, is very inconsistent with her other behaviour. I recently spent a weekend at her parent's place (on her suggestion - met her at uni, but don't see her much) and she would be very engaging, have a lot of fun, show interest and also offer ideas for future ways to hang out.

When texting, she often takes very long to respond (24 to 72 hours). This was already the case before the weekend, but last week it got so bad that I figured I'd take the hint and assumed she wasn't interested in anything more than casual acquaintanceship. Then she messaged me out of the blue about something interesting that reminded her of me, and when I responded, she asked how I was doing within minutes. I responded, and now she is once again taking her time, having passed 24 hours. 

I'm aware of the rule of ""when she barely responds move on"", but because she does take initiative and greatly enjoys time when we are face to face, I think she might be an exception. But I'm not sure, which is why I want to ask/confront her about the way she texts. **Question is** -  How do I do this in a good, non-destructive, respectful way? I don't want to give off the impression that I believe she owes quick responses, but her texting behaviour is just so inconsistent, both in itself and compared to the way she acts in person, that it leaves me very confused.

Do you think it's okay for somebody you've known for at least a year, been intimate with and spoken to on a day to day basis to communicate with you under a different name/surname and not really correct you on their age when you get it wrong? (I thought he was 47 but he might be in his mid 50s to late 60s) I get that they want to keep their personal life private but never really told me their name breeches that privacy and I feel it's unfair that they have hidden and changed basic details about themselves for so long that I can be honest about with them and everybody else in my life can be honest about.

He's separated or says he is and wanted to keep his family and personal life private and said that it was sacrosanct to him, I suppose it was something he wanted to keep separate from his dating life but I felt like not being able to tell me his real name even if he did just change his surname wasn't right after a long period of time and he could have corrected me on the things I got wrong like age. I wasn't looking to invade his privacy but act out of my own best interest and look into what I felt were red flags because honesty, authenticity and openness are paramount in my life.

Long story short, I met a guy on vacation on the west coast. My family is moving to the areas soon which is why I was there. I was upfront about this. We still text daily. He gets a little flirty/playful with winky faces. I really like his personality and actually enjoy texting him.

Now: he works in nightlife, clubs, casinos, bars, etc. That type of scene. Is it a red flag if a guy is in a job like that? The events he hosts have a lot of drunk women, bachelorette parties, strippers, playmates (from what I've seen from promo photos).

533,c98tyc,SuperMassiveBighorse,Building self confidence after multiple rejections and emotionally abusive past.,"Hiya, so I'm a 23 year old guy. I've had issues with my mental health for a while now, and although I've made good strides on my self worth in relation to friends, i really struggle with women. Since my first abusive relationship with a girl when I was 15 I haven't ever gotten my confidence very far. In short I was very into her, she knew this and kept me around on purpose, every time I tried to pull away she'd threaten self harm and suicide. 

From that point on it's been a continuing series of asking girls out and being completely shut down, or worse not shut down and carrying feelings around when they aren't wanted or reciprocated.

A lot of the issue on that front seems to be related to not being able to tell what's friendly flirting,  and what's actual flirting. Primarily though, I don't have the confidence to approach women without first having that friendly relationship. What can I do to break out of this self destructive cycle, and how can I feasibly meet women outside of dating apps (I'm not s particularly attractive guy so this shit just ain't working).

Any help appreciated, thanks.",2019-07-04 22:56:59,3,1,dating_advice

I'm tired of being the only single friend in my group. Alone time sucks. I want someone to enjoy things with. Someone to share experiences with. Not even huge experiences like traveling or kids, just small things like cooking new dinners or watching a TV show. 

Mundane things, like I made sloppy Joe's tonight and they were amazing and I wish someone was eating them with me. All these experiences are so meaningless alone.

We make out often, sometimes also sex.

So, I thought about talking to her about becoming sex friends (I think there is a specific term for this, but I don't know it), but she is the complete opposite of loyal. She founds a dick, she jumps on it.

I would not accept this because of my jealousy (caused by insecurity, I could be replaced any time by her).

So, what should I do?

I'm scared that a relationship with her would be closely followed by cheating, cheating and cheating.

Also six months ago I started meeting with a friend from uni, for chess. It was very nice and then we started hanging out for food, coffee, beer, just having a great time. Early I asked him if he liked me, but never made it clear it was romantic. He said he did, but he cannot see “the chemistry”. Which doesn’t really surprise me, I tend to be distanced and shy. 
But recently something changed. He started following me around when I’m going to eat, he remembers everything I say, listens to me, looks into my eyes when we’re talking, we laugh a lot. He even pointed out (in a group) that I have beautiful lips. He hugs me when he sees me and when we say goodbye. He acts like a gentleman and always makes sure I’m comfortable and that his jokes won’t be harmful to me. He references our meetings together when we’re in a group. He accompanies me when I’m going home after uni.

539,c98j37,NotAHippo4,"In my case, until when should I wait to text her? Repost from r/AskMen"," 

Hey guys,

So today, I was in a good mood and decided to go to starbucks to work a C Game Project and perhaps meet new people while I was at it. I saw this girl that sat behind me doing her physics hw and I ended approaching her as I was leaving(I told her why I waited so long to approach her, to which I think she responded very positively) and we ended up talking about why she liked physics, etc... She was very into the conversation and I ended up asker her for her phone number. And she gave it to me.

The thing is that I have gotten this far before, but I kept forgetting to text the women within the 24-48 hour magical window. I rarely get this far with women, but recently I have been trying a little bit harder. Sometimes, I can be extremely charismatic and funny and some other times, dull and boring, it just depends on my mood. I was thinking about setting an alarm and texting her at a specific time tonight, but I dont know whether or not I should text her now as I am nervous to the point of almost throwing up at the moment and really dont think that I can show the same level of attractive charisma that I had when I met her. I was thinking about first somehow winding down first and then text her when I leave to see the fireworks for the 4th of July.

As a 22 year old virgin, I dont see my virginity as a hinderance at all, and I like to think of myself as a person who is otherwise very comfortable under his own skin, but the problem is that I have little social experience with women as I never had them in my social circles as a kid. I guess I am just deathly afraid of fucking things up and have her forget about me, but seeing that im shaking of nervosity at the moment, I cant see myself carrying on good vibes as I did when I met her just a few hours ago. At the time, I was nervous, but not sooo nervous to the point where I go back to chit-chatting, I asked her deep(not necessarily too personal) questions such ""What is it about X that you like"" and exchanging stories like that. It was a very enjoyable and playfull conversation for me and apparently, to her as well. But now, I simply cannot relax and I am 20x as nervous as I was just a few hours ago.

This was reposted from r/AskMen because I think they want me to have an account with more karma, which I do, but it is locked down for suspiscious activity.",2019-07-04 22:25:56,11,1,dating_advice

I’ve had 3 boyfriends but I only ever liked the one I dated junior year of high school (thought I loved him but he treated me very shitty). I feel like giving up on relationships completely because I can honestly never see myself with someone I actually like and admire. Every guy I’ve been with (even the one I rlly liked) has been someone that I’ve compromised my standards for, mostly because I’m a very insecure person despite everyone I know agreeing that I’m beautiful. I’ve been working on improving my negative thoughts about most aspects in life (I have depression), but I feel like the wounds attached to my insecurity about my appearance run too deep to fix just by “faking it until I make it”. I can’t ever see myself with someone I find attractive, whether it’s their personality or physique. I can’t see someone drooling over me or adoring my personality, even though I’m genuine and kind. I was bullied in middle school, by people who had no other purpose than to spew venom. I was told I was “never going to find love”. That was in middle school, and still, 7 years later, I can’t shake the feeling. I just want love, pure love. I know it starts with myself and I am actively working on self love. But still, I can’t see anyone else ever loving me. In fact, I have been contemplating reentering a relationship that made me feel more dead inside because it was with a guy that despite being very nice and sweet, is just not meant for me. It was making me more insecure and sad.

543,c98bqa,American_and_will,Questioning my sexuality,"[23M] Preface: I posted this in r/sex and I don't think I'll get much help there. I'm not sure if this is a good place to ask about this either. Also, I’d like to apologize in advance if I misuse terminology. I’m admittedly ignorant with sexuality and related topics, and I’m sorry if some of the words I use are offensive or handled incorrectly: I feel like I had a massive breakthrough and wrote this quickly. Nonetheless, if you let me know, I’ll fix any microaggressions in this post.


   Today I randomly watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k810JfzsUU) video on YouTube. This guy went around, asking out as many guys as possible. Cool stuff. Naturally, I started thinking about what I’d do if a guy asked me out like that and the more I thought about the idea, the more I felt like I wouldn’t mind being asked out by a dude; in fact, I think that I’d really enjoy going on a date with a guy. But I’m not into guys. Physically. To clarify, I think I’d enjoy kissing a guy in a “dramatic ending of a romance flick” sort of way. But I can’t see myself having sex with another man. 


   I started thinking more. I reflected on all the past relationships, crushes, and love interests throughout my life, and I noticed a pattern I never realized before. The girls I fell for were all bros. Fellas, if you will. The girls I dated were boastful, action-oriented, and generally assertive people. I always assumed it was because I had an unhealthy preference for dominant girls.


   To contrast; when I think about my relationships with guys, I’ve had very strong connections with my guy friends in my life. To the extent that I’ve broken down and cried after losing a friend moving overseas. I loved them. And this is awful, AWFUL to admit, but I don’t think I’ve had feelings as intense as that for any of the girls I’ve dated.


   Don’t get me wrong; I enjoy checking girls out here and there. Porn rocks. But in dating, my relationships seem to feel unauthentic? I don’t know how to explain it. My relationships are usually excellent in the beginning but slowly become underwhelming and hollow in the long term. Not in a dark, depressing way, but more of a “huh, I guess this is it” way. Looking back now, I feel awful because I couldn’t explain why I lost feelings and grew detached because I didn’t understand either. My lost interest would obviously hurt my partners who did nothing to deserve that behavior, and the relationship would unravel from there. 


  I’m so happy that I discovered a bit more about my sexuality and myself. I’m so glad I watched that stupid video. However, I’m not sure how to move forward. 

 
  Had this colossal revelation but I’m not sure what to do with this new information, and I know this is cliché, but I genuinely don’t think my “perfect person” exists. Am I bi? I have so many questions, and I’m baffled. :)

  If you’ve seen this before or have dealt with this personally, I’d love to hear advice or anecdotes or anything, so I feel a little less... jumbled. Thanks!

Last night, while we were making out I guess I got a little carried away and told him if he knew that I really liked him. In response, he kinda chuckled and asked me why I said that. I told him that I just wanted him to know and if he knew and he laughed again and said “I know” 

This isn’t really the first time this has happened either. I’m always calling him cute and handsome and what not, and he hasn’t once commented on my physical appearance or paid me a compliment.

547,c983wl,thedreamsicle,How can I get her number or talk to her more?,"Ok so I just started a new job a week and a half ago as a dishwasher at a bar and I hate it so much, but the pay is good. I’m 18 and am 5’7 and have a bit of a young looking face so a lot of the people working there were surprised that I was 18 and I hate being treated like a child but the male workers call me “bud” which I probably shouldn’t get too mad at but it still gets on my nerves. The female workers call me “hon” and “babe” which make me feel like they’re talking to a 7 year old and not a 18 year old guy. All of them have no class and curse in every sentence and the girls talk about how big their boobs are and the guys talk about the girls they were serving food and drinks to and what they wanted to do to them and it makes me sick. But all of that is unrelated, I just wanted to vent a little.

So there’s this girl that works there as a bartender/server. She’s really nice and the first day I was there she came to the back and smiled at me and asked my name. We never actually had a full conversation because she’s always really busy working up at the bar but when she occasionally comes to the back to grab something she’ll say hi to me and ask how my day is going. No more than that tho. I think she’s so beautiful and I can’t stop thinking about her. She can’t be more than 10 years older than me, She has to be in her 20s I know that for sure. She’s not really a supermodel type of beautiful, just naturally beautiful to me. I’m thinking of quitting the job soon but I don’t want to leave without at least getting her number or talking to her a bit more. If I stay, I want to talk to her more often and get closer to her. It’s hard to talk to her more tho since I’m in the back washing dishes while she’s up front serving drinks, only occasionally walking back. When it closes and we’re all cleaning up she’s very busy too wiping the bar down and collecting her tips and stuff so it’s very hard for me to think of a way myself.

I’m not a really talkative person and all the workers have pointed it out, so it’s really hard for me to pull off something social like this, but I really need your guys help. How should I go about this? I just don’t want to screw this up for good because I’m tired of being alone. Ok thank you so much if you give me some help, I really appreciate you guys reading all of this and helping me out :)",2019-07-04 21:44:50,2,0,dating_advice
548,c98338,deperate_girl,So I (f18) has been dating this guy (m20) for a few months and is worried he is only trying to get in my pants,"First some backstory: So I've been dating this guy since around end March beginning of April and things haven't been very serious, I'd do like him a lot and love our conversations. This is my first real date and ""relationship"", so I don't know what to expect. He did ask me about a week ago if I thought this was more than just friends and I said yes. But there is nothing official about us jet. Btw I am a f18 and he is a m20. Now a few days ago we kissed for the first time after about 5 times of hanging out together and he tried to go down in my pants, I said no but maybe another time (I regret that now) and he was very supportive about it. 

Alongside this I have been having this weird feeling lately that is probably nothing, he asked me out on the day he found out I lost my virginity to a one night stand. I thought this was weird but ow well. Secondly he told me he is a virgin and I don't know if I believe this, he was so smooth with his hands while we were kissing. Thirth I'm failing college so I'm going to do different classes and he mentioned after we kissed that it would be so awkward if I was still in school with him. Fourth he was sort of saying he would jump in bed with any sober girl that would go to bed with him, he got a offer from a very drunk friend of mine to which he said no to, but if she was sober he said he would say yes. Fifth he sendt kissing emojis after we had our first date and were planning our second. And lastly most of the conversations with him have a sexual undertone for example on WhatsApp I say something along the lines of what do you want to do and he says you or he always think things through, it was and is sometimes funny but it is in the most random of times. 

I'm probably just looking to much into things and I am worrying if these are red flags or just normal things when dating. Any of all advice is dearly appreciated as I need a fresh pair of eyes on this. Thanks in advance :)

I tend to be passive-aggressive about it too, but I always regret it every time, feeling guilty on how I acted. 

Anyway, I was in an almost four-year relationship with this guy. Long story short, things got bad because of my jealousy. When I'm at it, I'd push him to the girl I'm jealous with. I don't know, that's just how I deal with the terrible emotion and it sucks. His reactions will always trigger me more, and It'll get messier from there.

Right now I am with this guy I know since forever, and he knows my history. Despite my tendencies, which he knows so well, he pursued me. Then things got rough because of my jealousy, again. He kinda stop pursuing me and I am devastated. I love the guy. :( I hate myself for being like this. I wish I can undo every stupid things I did and be with him again.

First of all, I am truly sorry for being like this. I am trying. I swear. I just need some advice on how to fix my problematic attitude. I don't want people leaving again me because of this. :(  Thank you!",2019-07-04 17:54:07,4,2,dating_advice

551,c980dr,heluuu67,I wish I was enough for at least one person in my life,"I am 22M. In highschool until the 10th grade, I had depression (?), or just constant unhappiness. ( I was a little bit fat kid, had no confidence.), And I was the one, who everyone bullied, and had 1-2 friend. After the 10th grade on summer I have started to change. Somehow I lost weight ( I was not working out, just lost weight). After that I have a little confidence, and started to have crushes. My first (and the strongest), crush was 2-2.5 years, so it lasted until almost the end of school. She just used me, emotionally, everything. That phase brought back to my ""depression"" stage, where I was showing literally no emotion. After that crush ended. I was attended to uni. It was a real turn around. Everyone like(d) me, wanted to hang out, have confidence etc. And I have started meeting girls. Meet several one but didn't work out. (I still dont have my first kiss, and I am a virgin), I have a normal friend cycle, and living my life, attending to events, having fun.. 

But, the only progress I have made, I became that friend, the official B plan. The one who you can rely on, when no one is around, and u can play with him, and you can listen their problems. (The New people I meet, and asks about if I have a gf, always get shocked, that I have never had, because they thought i had a bunch of them, lol at least its a compliment for me....) Every girl I met ,said that,we just didn't have the spark, and only a little one missing, when I ask what, they can't say a single reason.

The last time when I tried it was in spring. I had get on very well, with one of my classmates at uni, and we had lunch together, and met once or twice. I think about it is a friendship, because she(25F) has been with her bf 10+ years. When we last meet, she said, she hopes, we will meet before the next semester starts (I was really happy), (turned out, she and her bf, were on the edge of breaking up), two weeks later after that message, she called me and asked me if I wanted to hang out, we hang out, and it was an awesome afternoon, we have so much in common, lifeview, everything.  That meeting was in early june.( I took it As a friendly meeting not, a date) after that, we still talk sometime and get on well, on the late june I suggested her to meet again, she said she is very busy, and meet later, I said okay. 
I wrote her, on monday to ask whats up, and she said she is very happy that I wrote to her, and she was plannin' to write me too.  We literally exchanged 5-7 msg a day because both of us is busy (work, etc), and finally I asked her again, if She is free on the weekend, she said she is busy ,+ I know she works a lot) and aksed why, and I say , I just simply wanna meet. She ve just seen that message and didn't answer. (It was 3 days ago) (turned out they are together still with her bf), and I know her , She was not lying she was really happy that I write to her. She is happy to talk to me, but don't want to meet??!?!

She is the most beautiful person that I have ever met. Inside out, caring, loving, sweet, has a big heart everything. Maybe I am falling for her.... But I shouldn't have to, because several reasons.

I will graduate in 1 year and I am feeling down. I have no experience, and I am just that friend.

554,c97hgd,narkisseh,Why does he never ask to hang out?,"So I‘ve been seeing this incredibly kind and cute guy, we met through Uni 10 months ago. 2 1/2 months he started being really obvious about being interested in me (calling me everytime he was drunk, saying cute shit to me and generally showing interest in my life and personality etc.). 
One time he even called me hella drunk, telling me ‚I love you‘ a bunch of times but also saying that he means it and would say it to me sober if he would just dare. We‘ve hung out a couple times, I‘ve slept at his place all cuddled up to him a couple times and almost two weeks ago we kissed for the first time. Haven‘t done anything sexual yet.
I know that his interest in me is genuine cause he‘s literally the sweetest goofiest guy ever but was also hurt badly by his ex, so I know he‘s not just looking to fool around. 
But what I just don‘t get is why he never iniates to meet up! The first we hung out and the first time sleeping over at his place were iniated by him but ever since then I‘ve been the one to come forward and ask if he‘s free/if it‘s ok for me to come over/sleep over.
It‘s making me genuinely sad and frustrated that he doesn‘t ever really ask to see me anymore, especially now that things are getting more serious and it‘s obvious that I‘ve got a crush on him to.

So I (25m) have been dating this girl (22f) for 8 months now. We always have fun together, we get along well, we’re good together. But the other day she complained about not having the “click”. Then yesterday she attempted to break off the relationship again in reference to not feeling the click. Saying instead of 100% we’re at like 98% comparability I guess. She says she loves me to death, wants to marry me, but something is off and it’s causing her confusion, internal conflict. She doesn’t want to leave me but doesn’t know if that feeling will ever go away and doesn’t want to have to do this a year or two down the line IF the feeling sticks. It was a lot of back and forth. Yesterday she kind of retracted the statement saying she just wants to evaluate our relationship and see if she can figure out exactly what the feeling is. What exactly is off. 


Side info, we’ve gone on vacation together a few times and she says she feels the exact opposite. Giddy, filled with love, were at 100%.

558,c96tl9,breakhimu,My [25M] girlfriend [24F] shuts down when I mention my female friend/ex. Advice?,"My girlfriend of 2 years is a woman I cherish beyond anyone ever in my life. Since meeting her we accomplished so much together and life only continues to improve in different ways. She’s an emotional person and can be sensitive at times which is due to her being neglected by her parents, bullied, cheated on and missing out on what she call life milestones (prom, promise ring, etc). One thing i find amazing about her is that she will often identify when she’s in the wrong before I do and shut it down someway. I gained so much respect for her when I saw this. 

So when I met her, I was still in contact with all of my exes. In fact, the first person I introduce her too was my ex, let’s call her C, before her. Of course I didn’t tell her right away but she picked up quickly and we spoke about any concerns and it was over surprisingly quickly. However things took a not so fun turn when one night me and C went into a room together to talk about career changes and C’s problems. One thing to know about C is that she will literally talk all night if not stopped. My girlfriend was pretty tired that night so we left her C’s room and went into another for the night. Before anyone says anything absolutely nothing happened! But my girlfriend was thrown off by this and C and I sworn never to do anything like that again. Please note the relationship was still new at that point and C and I have been doing stuff like that for 4 years.

Since then I my girlfriend has been on edge occasionally about my previous relationships. I dropped C for a completely different reason and my first girlfriend from HS as well. Now it’s only just my friend E, who I dated for 2 months a years ago. I fucked up again and mentioned the time we tried to have sex but it didn’t work out. My girlfriend got uncomfortable because she visualized everything. To me the past doesn’t matter, but for her I guess I understand how she feels seeing me with an ex in her head. It also doesn’t help that E is Hispanic and that was my type around the time I met E, and sadly I wasn’t in African American women at the time due to my experiences from high school.  My girlfriend is African American. 

My girlfriend discovered through C that E was my ideal type of woman. She was pretty, like anime, and gaming. So I mentioned in a conversation and like a idiot C told my girlfriend. This on top of the sexual experience I told her made my girlfriend cautious about E. Every time I mention her in conversation or if I’m telling her about a text we shared she immediately goes quite. I mean almost completely shut off. I can see that she’s trying not let it get to her but I think all she sees when E is mentioned is something that could potentially cause her a great deal of emotional pain. This scares her, and it breaks my heart to see this. I recommended cutting out E from my friendship but she demanded I don’t do that unless some very fine lines were crossed. Which E hasn’t done anything of the sort. In fact I haven’t hung out with E in like 2 years. We just text over Facebook. 

Any advice on how to help my girlfriend get through this? She’s honestly trying and in recent days kept to herself when E was mentioned. I started limiting this unless it was needed for a story or important information 

Tl;dr Girlfriend is the love of my life, and so caring but she may have retroactive jealousy over a previous friend/ex being my ideal woman at that point in time. How to help her deal with this?",2019-07-04 19:45:29,6,0,dating_advice
559,c96qyp,LivingAgency8,Am I reading into this interaction too much?,"So, I barely slept last night, so I started the morning by hitting up a starbucks in a grocery store, and got myself a red eye(coffee with a shot of espresso in it). The cute woman behind the counter was nice enough, but tells me to go to the pick up spot while she does the shot, so I went there, got it, and went home. Then normal morning/early day stuff, showered, shaved, did a bunch of chores then lunchtime rolls around and I'm feeling drowsy again.

So I go back for another after grabbing lunch from the deli at the store. The lady starts off with things like ""well, long time no see stranger!"" and ""How've you been, it's been so long!"" I order my usual, and she says she can charge it as a refill and I'll only have to pay a bit more than the shot of espresso. Then she starts up with, ""well, why didn't you buy us lunch!"" and just being all chatty and really nice. Then she hands me my coffee at the till, all ready to go. 

Was that second time, after I had cleaned up for the day, flirting or just general customer service type stuff? Am I reading too much into this and let it go, or should I give her my number next time I'm there?",2019-07-04 19:38:55,4,1,dating_advice

I'm 23M, curious to even think if I would get a response or even bother with a girl I fancy at work who I think is 27 based on her looks. I have a negative thing for age gaps but a friend of mine advised me on not worrying about it.

I'm an IT technician so I move around quite a bit and I wouldn't mind chatting to her but she looks to be the quiet type. She's on a different floor than me and I always see her at her desk. So, me asking her out with little small talk may be a bit awkward in a busy work environment.

Should I hit her up on FB with straight up question asking if she's single or do it internally with our chatting application? No difference, but thought it was bit odd searching her up on FB.

I would never say we have been friends, we only saw each other at family get togethers. Our moms have worked together for over 25 years. When I saw her again 2 years ago I fell for her instantly and I think she did as well. She had a boyfriend so I couldn’t ask her out. But they broke up and I asked her out 3 months after.

She goes to university so we didn’t date for 3 months. The dates didn’t go very well. The first one was good but then I knew she wasn’t wanting to date me and felt like she was forcing herself to do so. But she’s got anxiety is sensitive and shy so it was hard to read. I asked her how she felt before she went back to university. She said she likes me but she’s not in the right mind set for another relationship (still hurting over her ex) then that her being away a lot would not be fair. 

I just accepted it. Then for the sake of the family get togethers I suggested we should be friends to which she agreed. So now that family get together has come around. I have a feeling it’s going to be awkward. Do I hug her to say hello or just do nothing? Then she’s been texting me first and she never does that. I don’t no if she wants something with me now or not? Do I flirt? I’m planning on just been her friend like I would all my other friends.

Both female are not very attractive, i dont feel jealousy, im not worried my bf have sth with them. However i feel really bad be treated like that. I feel it's very disrespectful. 

I told my bf they are not very friendly, and he shouldn't let other female touch him in front of me. However, he thinks that's all my problems, he said he will never bring me to meet his friends any more. He think i dont get along with them.

Texts me throughout the day and likes to send selfies of him just doing whatever, which I think is cute and entertaining. He treats me and his friends well, is extremely friendly with everyone, and SO chatty (which I love). He has a great job, owns a home, is adulting like a boss. No kids, never married. On paper he's a slam dunk.

Except 2 things:
1. He loves to bring up serious topics constantly- his dead parents, the heavy expectations placed on him by his siblings, his dead dog that he loved so much he can never own a dog again. There's a time and place for these conversations but he does this everyday even through text. He goes on and on, even when I've made it clear I no longer want to talk about it (I'll listen but I'm not a therapist). It weirdly feels like he is trying to impress me through his life experiences. Right now I'm on vacation and don't want to talk about dead dogs and told him so. He got passively upset and now replies with one word answers that don't really respond to what I was saying.
2. He drinks everyday (according to him it's just a ""relaxation beer"" a couple times a week but this isn't true) and gets extremely upset if I mention it, saying it's rude and judgemental of me.

Like I said, my friend thinks he's just trying to connect with me and that I need to be more open minded. But to me these feel like red flags (emotional vampire and future alcoholic). What do you guys think?",2019-07-04 15:09:42,14,2,dating_advice

We hooked up and she told me she has thought I was cute for at least a year. I told her I had a crush on her for forever.

What I’m concerned about is that, I’ve completely fallen for this girl, and she is looking for something casual. I’ve had serious relationships, hookups, and fwb. But I’ve never once felt like this towards someone. I ended my serious relationships because I never felt like I felt strongly for the person. But this girl makes my heart race just thinking about her. I’m confident enough, and open enough to straight up ask her what’s she’s wanting but I don’t want to ask her after two hookups. I’d at least like to go on a date or two but that doesn’t seem like it’s going to happen soon. 

I guess my question is: 
what do you think she’s looking for? 
She doesn’t seem like the person to play games. She isn’t going to string me along just because. But I don’t want to be pushy or clingy because that’s never been me lol. But I really don’t want to blow this. Don’t want her to lose interest, don’t wanna be too pushy.

It was a little annoying to get a phone call then, because the train station is really loud in the morning and it's hard to hear the phone.

You mean the one you moved in with in college?""

""No, not him -- but [some other person].""

I didn't really have anything to say. Death is hard. I just said I'm so sorry for the loss and that I'd be here for him if he needed me to be.

When I got to work, I sent him a followup and we had this exchange:

While I'm at the gym, he sends me this text, saying he and Ashley are headed into the city (which I thought was odd... he said to me he didn't want to get on another train today, but okay).

My family has some allergy issues but I hadn’t really had any reactions with dogs. I honestly haven’t been around cats at all. Well guess who is probably allergic to cats. 

Maybe it could be the mosquitoes? But the rash is only on one side of my body which is the side I slept on + the half of my face. I’m bummed out. She was cool however I’m not sure if it continue...she is asleep so I’ll have to talk to her about it.",2019-07-04 15:54:43,4,0,dating_advice
589,c943gg,Dumbyoungguy,Women only seem to like me (23M) when they’re drunk? Not sure how to fix that,"Kind of a weird question, but I’ve been out with women in a few different contexts, without actually going on dates.   
  
Mostly, they don’t like me too much, don’t show a lot of interest in me, and when I’ve got the stones to flirt/ask them out, are obviously resistant to my advances.   
  
  
But, when we mix alcohol into things, they become *very* flirty with me, often even in a physical manner.   
  
**Obviously,** that’s just a part of drinking.  
  
But if there’s attraction when they’re drunk, I feel like there’s probably *some* attraction when they’re sober... maybe I’m way off here tho, idk.   
  
I mean, I’m not trying to take a drunk girl home, plus I’d prefer a relationship to a hookup (especially a drunken hookup, never saw the appeal for that.)  
  
But when I try to talk to them the next day/week and try to see if I can either feel out attraction or ask them out on a date I get rebuffed.  
  
It seems like a girl has to get real drunk to consider making me her next mistake. 

  
  
Kind of a huge hit to the ego if you ask me.  
  
  
I’d love to find a girl that seems interested in me sober, before or after we go out drinking doesn’t matter to me.   
   
It just sucks seeing girls I *could* take home, if I was cool with having sex with girls too drunk to consent, and then ending up alone in the end.   
  
(Again, if we don’t drink, no attraction, after drinking... no attraction.)  
  
  
Also, to be clear, **Im not going to start taking advantage of drunk girls** Im just stating my frustrations with that situation, not suggesting I’ve reached a point where I’ve become a predator.",2019-07-04 15:48:22,14,1,dating_advice

Keeping it short as I can, any guy I've ever dated has lost interest and broken it off. I've been in one relationship and he only stayed with me only because he was afraid to break it off(he also constantly lied to me). Any guy I've asked out has turned me down. 

I haven't been in a relationship in 8 years. I haven't had sex in almost 4 years. I haven't had any romantic interactions with a man in those almost 4 years. I've come close to a few dates, but nothing came of it. One was from bumble, but honestly I'm not into online dating. 

A few years ago I asked a good guy friend what was a reason that would make him not want to date me and he said that question wasn't for him to answer. I don't trust anyone else to ask such a personal question. 

Looks-wise, I'm not ugly. I'm overweight right now but I haven't always been. When I was slimmer, it didn't make a difference. Regardless, that shouldn't hurt my chances of dating anyone so I don't think that's the issue. I do consider myself a good person, and I've put the needs of others in front of mine too many times.

This same thing has happened to me a lot; where I'll go out specifically to conquer my fears of talking to women and failing miserably, 3 times just in the last month.  The best way I can describe it is like a mental wall where my body will literally move away on its own out of fear.  There's also the fear that I'll be the creep she tells her friends to avoid, and that I'll never be able to show my face again.  I feel like a loser right now and it's frustrating that it's much easier for everyone else.

EDIT: This was originally a comment but I think it would probably be better up here.I think my issues go deeper than just being afraid to talk to women, as I'm afraid to talk to people in public in general.  I have gone to counseling for social anxiety, but I've never gotten to the point of actually talking to people.  I'm not even really socially awkward, a lot of people have told me that I'm not, but I still can't get over the fear.  It's like I don't want to bother people so much that I avoid them.  I can talk to cashiers or to people at work if they initiate, otherwise it's impossible.  Even compliments are difficult for me.

I think part of my frustration is that I don't think anyone understands what it's like for me.  Honestly, approaching a woman and jumping out of a plane are the same feeling.  It's not even that I overthink the situation, it's more like my body avoids people without a second thought.

593,c8yeh0,throwaway487921,"(18M, 18F) How to ask her out?","Main question in bold at the bottom. 

We’re pretty good friends and we hung out for the first time alone last week and it went well. Conversation was good and when she had to run errands I offered to help her with some of them so that was the main activity of that meetup. 

I never called that meetup a date and she didn’t seem to think it was a date either so that was ok. But I’m running out of time to spend with her this summer, which is why I want our next hangout to be an actual date. My plan is to get smoothies and just walk around together at the beach at sunset. 

As for gauging her interest in me, she likes me a lot as a friend and there have been small indicators like messaging me randomly (“I’m so bored lol”) and getting happy when I want to do stuff with her (e.g. errands). She also shows interest in stuff I like, such as when I was showing her how to solve a Rubik’s cube and she was super interested in it. 

Sometimes I offer to do something for her, she initially refuses, but then a minute later she asks me if I can do that thing for her (like picking her up from her house to go somewhere). And if I’m like “I’m doing X with our friends” she’ll be like “Ok” but then suddenly she’ll join us too even if she initially said no. 

But aside from that, we both treat each other the same way we treat our friends so that’s what’s making me unsure. Not to mention, she is pretty forgetful and has almost forgotten about our meetups before. My gut feeling is telling me that she kinda likes me, so I still want to shoot my shot though. 

I won’t be able to see her in person for a few days so I think I’ll have to do this over Snapchat. **So my main question is how do I word the message in which I ask her out? I’m not going to confess any feelings, so I’m just looking for the right things to say that makes it clear I’m asking her on a date, but also not super blunt.**",2019-07-04 04:56:47,6,6,dating_advice

598,c9306x,Throwaway989867,Texting post first-date. Need advice/help please.,"Hello people of reddit! 20M here.  

So one week ago i went to a date with a girl around my age, we matched through tinder and we started talking. If it matters she actually asked me out first to which i obviously said yes too and this is my first date ever. So we hang out for 5 hours and the conversations were great and it had a good flow, we talked about everything to get to know each other and we both laughed at our jokes. She told me she had a good time and so did I, and I asked her out for a second date just before I went home to which she said yes (she would be gone for a week because of vacation, but she said she would like to meet again when she is at home). 

Everything about the date felt really good and I was really happy. But recently I've noticed that we dont talk a lot through snapchat/text anymore, before we would ask each other how our day was going and stuff like that (we snapchatted a lot just before i was about to meet her) but not so much anymore. I've recently noticed she would even leave me on open more often (especially these past three days) on snapchat after i send her something or when i respond to her snaps. This obviously makes me confused and sad so I don't send her anything for the rest of the day and the conversation would just die at that. She is on a vacation right now so maybe I'm reading too much into this but I know she snaps other people because she would sometimes send snaps that are meant to other people aswell not just me.   


Is it a good idea if I ask her about why she is purposely leaving me on open? And if she even is still interested about going to a second date with me? Or should i wait it out and ask her about the date when she is back home? It's really confusing to me so I would like some advice... Thanks!",2019-07-04 14:08:15,6,1,dating_advice

6 months ago I broke up with my girlfriend after 1,5 year of relationship. She was really amazing. We had these same hobbies and we liked those same things. She was like 1:1 female version of me. I broke up with her because she got into deep depression. I know it sounds horrible but she didn’t want to go to the doctor, had 2 suicide attempts and everything was just worthless for her. Our relationship became toxic as hell. I couldn’t bear with this negativity and my feelings for her just burn out. 
So I broke up with her. We decided to stay friends cause she is the most important person in my life and she said that I’m her too.

In those 6 months I had another girlfriend but we broke up. 

Few days ago my ex girlfriend(main girl of this story) said that she still have feelings for me and how I feel. She still is literally my best friend and the most important person in my life. We know each other 2 years. Right now she really changed herself. She doesn’t longer have this depression and suicide thoughts. She is again like a person which I met 2 years ago and fell in love with.

Right now I don’t know what to do. She asks me how I feel about her and I don’t want her to wait for me for don’t know how long. 

The advantages of this relationship would be that she is really lovely and has those same hobbies as me. She is 1:1 me even when it comes to character. I know I would get along with her and we would understand each other.

The disadvantages is that I’m scared. She is really precious for me and I don’t want to hurt her. I don’t know if this relationship will work but if not, I will lose her as my best friend. I’m just scared.

She’s a South Korean girl who’s visiting Canada for 6+ months and was looking to improve her English.


Me, I’m a Canadian Korean who has lived in Canada practically his entire life and can speak korean ever so conversationally. I can keep conversations with her in korean while looking up phrases on google translate every so often.


Here are some factors I’ve noticed when hanging out with her:


She has never declined any of my invitations.


She pays for herself (even for myself I kinda feel bad) when I offer to pay


She texts me and tells me irl that she often wonders when I’ll text her back (I was sleeping during that time)


I let her go home with my hoodie when it was cold, and she told me the scent of my hoodie smells good (?????)


She wants to call me every so often. The calls go until we sleep or until something comes up


She wants to hang out whenever I get the chance. I’m a full time university student juggling 2 part time jobs atm, so my schedule has literally been me doing my homework hardcore in one sitting to make time for her


She’s fine with me sleeping over at her place (it was late during Canada day and my house was a bit far). I declined. She also wants to visit my place (like she says she wants to watch me do homework (???))


Literally tells me everything that happened to her that day, and opened up to personal experiences from the past


She holds onto my sleeve or arm sometimes, usually in busy streets


Everytime we hang out it’s for as long as possible. The past 2 times we were out until very late. 



While this is all said and done, she has yet to mention anything about wanting to date, or hinting at it. She has mentioned that she wants a boyfriend someday, but idk could’ve been small talk.


Now, please evaluate me and tell me I’m either going crazy stupid mode or I’m letting my ego get to me.

Me (22F) and bf (21M) have been dating for 3 years. We’ve been on and off. He’s my first boyfriend I’ve ever had. Our relationship started off to a rocky start, he’d always compare me to other girls, get mad about financial issues (blaming me for “taking up” all his money like dates, going out to eat, etc.), and the one that still affects to me this day, he made me feel inadequate in the looks department. I still carry his words with my every day like a ball and chain.

So we break up - the 1st of many - and he’s definitely changed so much that I feel that he “appreciates” me now. He always calls me beautiful, no longer complains about taking me out and whatnot. So yay for that. 

Other time we broke up was once we were arguing and he started to throw shit around and he grabbed me - not aggressively - but he just didn’t want me to leave the house and it just overall freaked me out. Got back together he hasn’t done that since then.

Issue we have nowadays is that he doesn’t listen to me. Whenever he’s being too rough or I tell him to STOP, he doesn’t STOP. It’ll take like 3-4 times until he actually listens to me. Sometimes I’ll snap at him and he’ll turn it around on me as if I’m being too harsh or he’ll say “why are you being like this???” 

There also have been a couple times when he’s been mad and he’s sort of shoved my cat. I get mad at him for it and he’ll dismiss it and say “she’s not hurt or dead” or sometimes he’ll say that he didn’t even do anything at all!! But I’ve seen with my own eyes that he’s aggressive w her and deny it!

Lastly, he’s very disrespectful to his mom. He says that’s just “their relationship” and his mom allows it, but it makes me feel so uneasy the way  him and his siblings interact with her. They’ll tell her to STFU, throw shit at her, and just won’t listen. My bf is the least disrespectful one to say the least. My mom always told me that if he disrespects his mom that he’s gonna disrespect you and I’ve realized now that no truer words have been spoken. And now he’s gotten to the point where he’s started to somewhat complain about my mom and I immediately shut it down. My mom and I are best friends, and we’re super close to each other. I’m not letting anybody talk about her unless it’s me lol. 

I know what you all must be thinking, that how stupid I am for staying with him seeing all those signs. But hey, I was 19 and stupid as fuck. As these 3 years have gone by, I’ve gone to realize my self worth and what my standards are becoming. Now that I’ve been with him for so long, might as well try to make it work? 

TL;DR
Bf has aggressive tendencies. Doesn’t listen to me when I tell him stop. Some aggression towards my cat. Disrespectful to his mom and sometimes me. Now talking shit about my mom.",2019-07-04 12:05:50,3,1,dating_advice

Recently, I went on vacation on the west coast and met a guy 29M. My family is eventually moving out there, and I was up front with him about this. We exchanged numbers and we are still talking daily to this day. All conversations are long, lots of questions, he texts back quickly (even with a time difference), and even texts me when he's out at a bar or something with friends.

I'm going back to visit (as a family vacation, but i'm sure I can get a date in at some point). We have talked about setting up some dates when I get back there.

 I am very inexperienced with guys. Only been in one relationship which lasted 4 years. And had sex with a guy I was dating maybe a year after that break up, but it ended too. 

I am very nervous that my upbringing and influences where I am from will be a huge contrast to him. He works in nightlife, clubs and bars/casinos. And was in a frat in college. Obviously, I can't expect him (or anyone) to have low numbers. But I'm just worried that I'll be too shy the next time I see him if he tries to kiss me or something.   
Or I'd want to take things too slow in his eyes. Or I worry I'm a bad kisser. My mind is going a thousand miles a minute when I think about possibly seeing him again.   

&amp;#x200B;

Would my lack of experience hinder me in possibly dating him if things were to get that far? I am afraid my own thoughts regarding this will sabotage me from ever even possibly dating him to begin with.",2019-07-04 01:29:29,17,6,dating_advice

613,c8zzb3,galiathusz,My(19M) girlfriend(19F) is having Emotional Exhaustion,"We've been dating for 6 months. We used to talk every day, go out, having a lot of fun. She is a shy type of girl and it's her first relationship. She was happy with me.

So due to some problems in institution she took a 3 month break. Her parents wanted her to find a side job because she wasn't studying at the time. 

She decided to work in a local store in my town (she lives in a village near me). The amount of work time was huge, it was like 12 hours a day talking to customers. After 1.5 month she finally left the job, it was too hard for her. That's where it all started.

On the next day she said she doesn't want to do anything, doesn't feel anything. Even told me she doesn't know if the feelings to me were at all. I've asked her how does she feel or how could i help her, told her to go out with close friends or with me. The answers were always 'i don't know' and 'i don't want to'.


I'm desperate in what to do. How do i help her? Do i just wait? Will she love and be happy with me after recovery? Has anyone been through this?",2019-07-04 08:07:06,5,2,dating_advice

I've been with my partner for 10+ years, and we are both in our mid 20's. I don't know if it's relevant but I haven't really had many positive sexual experiences with anyone else. I guess I am the LL partner, although that doesn't quite fit, and we have definitely been having problems in the bedroom for a while.   


We have talked it out a couple of times with little luck, porn usage has been a huge problem for us, with me being less interested the more I see naked images/ He doesn't seem to put much effort into being subtle, and invariably that means he looks at it more and it is a pretty awful cycle. He is aware of my feelings on this, for what it's worth but hasn't changed.   


That being said we have been on an upswing more recently, and I think it might be because he is spending more time with me. Probably a stupid question but is it unusual to be influenced by how close I feel to him emotionally?

620,c8rm7a,zrk03,"Being the 3rd/5th wheel sucks, but not all experiences are equal","I've had 2 experiences so far in my life where I was the 5th wheel. Although they both stung, the degree of the sting varied on the situation.

The first experience was last summer when me, my best friend and my other friend (the girl I liked) were supposed to go bowling. A few hours before, my best friend asked me if it was okay if he brought his girlfriend. Of course I said yes. Then, literally not long after my female friend texted me telling if it was okay if she brought someone (her bf). She and my best friend both apologized for making me the fifth wheel. My best friend even offered to find another person to come. I declined. It was honestly one of the most sickening experiences ever.

My second experience was last week when me, my two best friends and their SOs went hiking. This time it wasn't nearly as bad, and somewhat enjoyable but I did get a bit lonely when everyone stopped for rest and was occupied with their SOs, While I'm just awkwardly standing there finding something to do.

Obviously this is a no shit post because it would make sense that being the fifth wheel in a case where one of the couples includes the person you like, while comparatively two of your best friends and their SOs. I just figured I'd share this revelation :D

628,c8y79v,prophetman124,Trying to ask out a barista!,"So a little backstory 24 (m) currently in college whos a regular in the local coffee place in town and there’s this one female cafe employee who always notices me during the rush period of customers and I always see her give neutral expressions to customers but an excited happy expression towards me. 

So recently we ended up talking in idle conversation and I so wish I could keep talking more because I’m funny to her and I try to make  her laugh but there were people behind me waiting patiently to buy coffee so I have to wrap it up. 

Also for some reason I regrettably haven’t looked at her name tag so I cant look her up on social media to see if she’s single or not (not to  sound creepy). And the annoying part of it is that are conversations has to end abruptly because of the customers pouring in. 

So my plan was next time I see her i’ll try to segway the quick conversation to give her my number or read her name tag so I can be certain she’s single so  it wouldn’t be awkward.

And there’s a whole possibility her overtly happy nature to only from what I’ve seen she displays to me isn’t a sign of attraction. 

But yeah I’m gonna take the leap of faith and give her my number. The only con from what I’m seeing is humiliation from people or employees who eavesdrop.

629,c910h8,tawauaomryyyy,Moral dilemma of having sex with a girl cheating on her boyfriend,"We’re all 22-25 years old. I’ve known this girl, call her A, for a while. She was my ex girlfriends roommate.

We started off as friends and have been friends for about two years. She’s been with her boyfriend for about 4 years. They have a rocky relationship, with a number of breaks and some cheating in the past from both parties. I know the guy, not very well. We don’t hang out and I wouldn’t consider him a good friend. 

6 months ago my ex girlfriend and I broke up. A and I kept hanging out and got pretty close. About a month ago we got even closer and ended up kissing. A week later we hung out again and things progressed to sex.

I never pressured her to do anything. I let her initiate everything. I’m not interested in a relationship at the moment. I like her as a person and want to continue having sex with her too. I told her that openly and she seemed okay with it. 

I feel a little bit bad for her boyfriend. I’m not good friends with him though so I don’t worry about that relationship.

631,c90uos,jugsjuggler,Need help with Ukrainian girl about Ukrainian dating customs,"I met this Ukrainian girl in Lisbon through an app and we hit it off pretty well. We had a lot to talk about and an hour into the date she was leaning her head onto my shoulder. I have learned to play cautious as I've fucked up things before for trying to act too fast, so, I gave her a kiss before dropping her home, it was good but, for the next couple of days, I thought she was either playing hard to get or just wasn't that into me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two days later, I asked her when she would have some free time so I could cook her dinner and it happened she had a 2-hour slot between shifts the next evening. She showed up in an amazing summer dress - I forgot to mention, this girl is drop-dead gorgeous.

  
Dinner was great, conversation was great, but, by the time I started to make a move, it was time for her to go.

&amp;#x200B;

Next day, same thing, she kept ignoring me. I sent her a pic from the beach in the afternoon, asking if I should try kite surfing and she didn't even look at my msg on Whatsapp even though I saw her online.  Btw, this was my first and only message.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, she texted, ""Nice, did you try?""

&amp;#x200B;

I wrote, ""No, next time."" Then, I wrote, ""When do you have some free time this week? Do you still wanna hangout?""

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I thought she was going to write... ""We'll see."" or some other shit people write when they are not interested, but she wrote, ""Today)""

&amp;#x200B;

Great. She came over to my apartment, watched a movie and somehow, someway, I got her to lay in bed with me for a few minutes before she left but, slowly but surely, I got her comfortable enough so we were both naked in bed with her assuring me it wouldn't go past that. Well, it did. Sex was very good, the type that after we finished a session, she would come and embraced me from behind, very sweet, a good sign in my book.

&amp;#x200B;

However, after we were done, she seemed a little bothered. I asked if there was anything wrong and she said, ""I never got this close this fast with someone before."" No idea if this was true or not but it seemed honest to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next morning she sent me a Good morning with a kiss emoji but since then, which was two days ago, she seems to be giving me the cold shoulder on Whatsapp. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, as a  23-year old Ukrainian woman, what is she expecting from me? I like her and I don't want to fuck things up. Should I be sending lovey-dovey messages, maybe even flowers, as flowers is a big thing in the Ukraine - I hear - or should I keep playing it cool as I have? Keeping it casual until she gives me the greenlight to go full-on wannabe boyfriend mode? lol

We chatted daily and he visited me in my town about a month later. He had a contract in my town, so he assumed he’d back be lots more, but the contract was paused and while we continued to talk daily, he would refuse to make plans to see each other. I had finally had enough and stopped talking to him. 

About a month later, we reconnected and he told me he’d be in town again. We met up (last Saturday) and had an amazing time. We laugh so much together that it literally hurt. He told me he was going through some personal things when we first met, but that everything is better now.

He barely texted the following day but I figured he’s busy with his kids who he sees mostly on weekends. Tuesday we texted a bit and he said some lovely things like “I loved sleeping beside you” and “I can’t wait to see you again” and “I’m so attracted to you, I can’t explain it”.

Today we texted a bit and tonight I sent him some things and he has not responded. They weren’t questions but I still feel like they warrant a response and he was active on Instagram. I don’t know if I’m overthinking because he does say those things and did make an effort to see me again but then is just horrible at communicating sometimes....?

We had our problems, he wasn't perfect, but he was a wonderful man.I just started talking to a new guy that I ""met"" online, through a friend's book of faces  (i commented on one of her statuses, he commented back and then privately messaged me soon after). He was her friend/friend of her husband's. He's a lot older than me, too, he's almost 50 (my late husband was in his 40s, so that's not a huge issue with me). He seems absolutely wonderful, but there are some things that bring me pause. I guess I need opinions before I fly up to meet him in a couple of weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

1. he goes back and forth on certain things. Like my friend is a sahm. In one breath he talks about how she's a great mom and wife and she takes care of him and feeds him and offers him lunch and everything else and in the other breath he tells me she's a spoiled brat who needs to keep her mouth shut.. talking about how they ""eat out all the time"" and she ""breaks them"" by spending money that's not hers.
2. He picked a fight tonight because he said they ""yell at their kids too much"", and when he described it I laughed because, as a mom of three small kids, I get it. Parenting is hard. When there's more kids than adults, there will be yelling, and discipline. He suggested it was abusive, but couldn't say how beyond well he heard the dad yelling. I told him I wasn't doing that tonight (I'm on vacation right now anyway with some girlfriends) and I wasn't arguing and he just kept on messaging him. So I ignored. An hour later he was back to his 'normal' self and saying well I needed to think about ""THINGS"" that today was the 1 year anniversary of the last time he got to see his child (the parents divorced, and I had no idea he hadn't seen the kid in a year, he didn't tell me) and that if I didn't get over this fit and stop ignoring, well, I wasn't the woman he thought I was.
3. He told me it'd been 4+ months since he'd had interactions physically with a woman... I was discussing it with my friend and she was like wait, what? Turns out he lied and he'd had girls over less than a month ago and there was proof.
4. my sister in laws are appalled after reading the messages because he calls me 'little girl' every other breath.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know. In a way it feels weird to back away from somebody I do enjoy talking to very much because of silly arguments or because of how he flips back and forth his opinion of someone else, but it also feels weird that after only a week he's saying he loves me and I feel as if you can learn a lot about a person with how they speak about other people.I tried to explain that he doesn't get it because he's only got one child, but groceries for 3 kids is expensive, and so is cooking for 5 people (and taxing mentally/physically too). That sometimes us moms will want to go out to eat to preserve our sanity. Stuff like that. That when you're a parent of 3 under 6 it's hard to go to the gym for 3-4 hours a day like he does, because we want to be with our kids. No, he wasn't directly talking down to ME, but I agreed with 98% of the things my friends were doing that he complained about. It's just everyday typical life with a LOT of small children (he only has one).

For the last year and a half I have been hopeless in the realms of dating. I have pretty much had no luck with building a romantic relationship with any girls that I end up meeting. This stems from two things that I can recognize, I had a past relationship for a few months before that and felt like I was in love with her. When we broke up, I thought I was going to be able to find a new partner but something wasn't right. It's like I had lost my motivation and smoothness that I had once had. Then my mental issues spiked up for a few months which pretty much immobilized me. I spent the days with no job no education, sitting on a couch watching TV like a loser. This year I finally got better and it's like the negative personality traits I have fizzle up when I go out with friends or try to talk to new potential partners. I am a very lonely person, I work 40 hours a week now, and besides making money I pretty much have no hobbies anymore. It's like I don't have any energy to do anything and I have this feeling in the back of my head that says like ""what's the point"". Life seems dull to me most of the time unless I'm out with my friends or family. When I'm alone I get this weird feeling like I NEED to talk to people, so I go onto social media (snapchat which is the only thing I use) and then keep trying to talk to females who just clearly don't care about me. They'll open my snapchats or messages and just not respond, and then like a few days later I'll just keep trying and trying. It obviously makes me seem like a desperate loser to them and then it just sinks a bigger hole. I have some female friends who I'm close with and they say to just ""be yourself"" but it's like this view of myself is so bad that why would I want to ""be myself""? Does anyone have any advice on how I can improve my own self image? I can barely even figure myself out in the first place so it's really hard for me. I definitely feel like I'm a needy person and I think the big thing why nobody has an interest in me is cause I come off as that on social media.

637,c90fau,silver101234,If someone is updating their tinder pictures while you’re dating them does that mean they’re not interested?,"A little bit of context so my question has a bit of background: 

I dated this guy off bumble at the end of last year and we went on 3 dates. He’s super busy with work and study and stuff so he didn’t really have much time to spend with me and I felt I was initiating a lot of the texting so I just stopped making an effort and things fizzled out. 

I made a tinder earlier in the year and we matched on there, and then he messaged me out of the blue a few days ago saying he knows it’s been a while but if I wanted to catch up. 

We didn’t end on malicious terms or anything so I agreed. We had a wonderful time, and had a lengthy makeout session after and he messaged me the next day saying he enjoyed it and wants to do it again.

639,c8yj6h,picklesstpeter,Not sure if I’m single or in a relationship? Am I wasting my time ?,"I (25 F) have been seeing a guy (32 M)  since March but am unsure if he’s now my boyfriend or if I can still date others. 

He had been in a two year relationship and they broke up in January.  In March, we started hanging out one on one and then started hooking up. We have been going on dates and hooking up since then. 

One evening I asked if he was seeing other people and his response was “no” and that he was “very content and there was no need”. The thing that bothers me is that he never asked me the same thing back... 

Fast forward to this past June, I graduated from college and my mom, dad, and brother were in town for the graduation. We had not talked about it so I did not know what to introduce him as to my close friends even though my family considers him my boyfriend.. 

Today, a friend asked me if I was single, because she wanted to introduce me to someone. It was then that I realized that I’m not sure if I’m his girlfriend (I have never heard him refer to me as that) and am not sure how to proceed. 

Is it wrong for me to see other people if he has not made it clear we are in an exclusive relationship? I am mostly satisfied with the relationship but this bothers me that he has not felt the need to ask to be exclusive.",2019-07-04 05:11:29,10,2,dating_advice

641,c8u10s,-european-bob-,[35M] I’m stuck,"Hi. I’m 35. I haven’t been in a relationship in at least 10 years. I haven’t had sex in about 8? I lost count. I’m genuinely scared I’m going to die alone. And I don’t know what to do. 

My past. I had a 2-3 year relationship in the late 2000s which ended in her cheating on me. I then had a 6m-1y relationship which ended in her cheating on me with 3 different people. I’ve been open about being interested in several others, however, they’ve been more interested in my friends. One of which has married one of my friends and now has kids. So I feel my luck has been terrible.

I moved away from my home town some time ago to get a fresh start and hoping to make new friends. I now have secure well paid job, lots of good friends. But I still seem to be stuck when it comes to approaching women or trying to find a date. All of my friends are married with their own house and kids, and I just feel depressed.

I haven’t dated anyone since 2007. I gave up on dating apps and actually trying to find someone a long time ago in the hopes that “someone will find me” but that just doesn’t work does it. And reading the posts on here, I’ve realised I’m being “breadcrumbed” by someone, who will give me a bit of attention saying things like she misses me... then blanks me when other things or friends come up.

I’m overweight. Im generally a socially awkward person. I have pretty much no confidence in myself. Where the hell do I start?!",2019-07-03 21:38:19,21,8,dating_advice
642,c8x8zz,NeedGirlHelpPlease,Need some advice on my crush. Help would be great thank ya!,"Okay little bit of a storytime.  So I am in college and I had chemistry lab with this really cute girl, it sounds cheesy, but from the moment she first talked to me, i caught feelings for her... 

Over time we developed more of a friendship we would walk to lab together, do the pre and post labs together, even went out to eat together a couple times, just the two of us.  I should have made a move before the last lab, but I didn’t wanna ruin our friendship.

Lab ended and it was also the end of the semester.  She lives near me so i tried to hang out with her over winter break but out plans never went through.  So I took that as a sign that she wasn’t into me and we really didn’t talk much after that.  

The end of the school year comes around and she starts swiping up on all my stories on Snapchat.  And by a lot I mean 4-5 by the start of summer.  I don’t post stories too often.  Anyway I’ve swiped up on her stories too now and it’s been going on for a while.  Usually we have pretty good conversations not boring one word responses.  

However at the end of the conversation she leaves me on open, no streak.  And I’ve tried to start a non-conspicuous streak with her but boom left on open.   

So my question is do you think she has feelings for me too or is she just being friendly.  I’ve never really had a girlfriend so I just wanna hear a couple peoples thoughts.  Thanks!",2019-07-04 02:51:43,2,2,dating_advice

Because of this, I don't want to tell her how badly I'm crushing on her because that's just plain selfish and I don't want to give her anything else to stress out about.

That being said...at one point over text she asked me why I care about her so much, and I didn't really respond in time so she said ""it's okay you don't have to answer"". So I'm almost 100% sure that she already knows I like her.

I just don't know what to do. I don't want to tell her because then it'll just be invalidating everything I've done to try and help her because she'll think my motivations weren't genuine and I was only ever friendly with her because I had feelings for her, which isn't true.

So here's the thing. I'm too shy and introverted person. When it comes to a relationship, I always fail. But this time I think I need to improve myself and will go out to the comfort zone.

Here how it starts. I met the girl by buying her Nintendo3Ds a year ago I think. I already liked here the moment I see her. She just went from a break up that's why I didn't want to pursue her. She has a cat named Robin and she wants somebody to adopt her cat that's why here I am taking chances and adopted the cat. We jut have a simple conversation just talking about the cat that I adopted. But in just a month, she already found someone. That's why I think she doesn't like me or doesn't even bother about me and I stop.

A year after. I forgot maybe it was two years after. I found her again in social media and added her. I found out the she and that boy just went from break up. I still found her attractive and dude, I don't know what to do. I just have a little conversation again with her talking about the cat that I adopted but that stupid cat go away in our house and I don't even know where that cat is now. We just chatted a little bit but I don't know if she was just concern about her cat? or she was into me.

647,c8y4e5,1985dsmk,Introducing the kids,"33/f here, dating 35/m. We've slowly started introducing our kids. We first introduced them casually at a local park where they all love to play. It was great,  we both agreed it went well. That was last month. 

Today, we both took our kids to see a movie. Same movie, same place, same time. The kids saw each other and we just kind of let them guide it. We didn't sit together until my kids &amp; I left to go to the bathroom, and on the way back they asked us to sit with them, so we did. 

We got split up walking out of the theater but ran back into each other in the parking lot. I already knew he planned to have a bonfire and light sparklers tonight but he called me back when he saw me in the parking lot and asked if we wanted to come over. So, we went. It was great, or so I thought. His son and my oldest played. My youngest was tired so I sat with him for awhile. But the kids all interacted with both of us. Kids all behaved. I thought it went super well. We snuck a few seconds of alone time three times and kissed but otherwise acted as if we were just friends. 

When I got home I texted him thanks for having us over 😘 and all I got was a, ""k."" Normally he texts to make sure I got home ok and we have conversations until we are both literally falling asleep. On Fb we were going back and forth all day on one of my posts about who would have the last word, and when I commented after I got home, he commented, ""k you win."" So I texted him, ""I win huh. Are you ok?"" And he just said he was ok, just tired. So I said goodnight and he never said anything back. 

So, those of you who have introduced kids, how was it? How did you do it? Were there  any complications? I'm thinking something went wrong tonight that I missed. Should I ask him outright or let it go? 

It probably seems trivial but I've never involved my kids with anyone. Neither has he. He has said before that he wants to take it slow because his son isn't ready. So I don't know if he's worrying about his son. Navigating a new relationship can be hard, even harder with kids.",2019-07-04 04:25:34,2,2,dating_advice

So, I work at a lab at school, and she’s another student also working in the lab. We barely talked a couple times, but a couple weeks ago she said that “it feels like I haven’t seen you in a while” and I thought that was strange because it had only been a week since we saw each other.

We then started talking more at the lab, and she laughs pretty loudly at my jokes, definitely louder than laughing with others. And like yesterday, we were talking alone and she kept kinda playing with her hair and like kept telling me a lot of stuff about her trip to South America. 

And today, we were talking about weird videos, and I was telling her this weird knife video and she said that she has to find that video, and then I told her I can send it to her and she gave me her number.

 And anyway, I was just wondering if you guys think she’s possibly into me/if those are some signs that she’d open to a date? Thank you. Can you tell I’m overthinking?",2019-07-04 04:15:09,4,2,dating_advice

651,c8zuyw,anonymuwuse,Give Longterm Relationship another go vs Letting it go,"Hi! I would love some insight and wisdom into a predicament I’m in.

This is VERY long, so scroll down to the very bottom for the TLDR;

I (26, F) was dating someone (24, M) since we were 22 and 20 respectively. We’re both Christian so values seemed to line up. Over the years, it became obvious the way we communicate and resolve conflict is very different. He does not like to talk / text much while I’m more extroverted and can juggle multiple text threads at one time. In conflict, I tend to be more initially intense, sometimes harsh, but I forgive, forget and leave the hurt behind more readily. He struggles to communicate straight away, so understandably backs off, needs space to cool down to avoid saying anything he regrets. 

The downside is he doesn’t often say how long he needs to cool down and sometimes leaves the conflict after saying something not so nice (if physically with me, he may stay silent for 15-30 min [my eyes glaze over and it’s so hard when what I say doesn’t help or he doesn’t want physical affection during this time]; if arguing over text, he won’t reply for an hour or a few or until late at night, sometimes the next day). I’m more the kind to say shitty things but can’t leave the conversation or go to sleep without resolving or at least making peace from my side. I usually make peace (apologise, ask how he’s going) within an hour? Although sometimes I do it prematurely and I get riled up again, eventually I’m leave a peace message and just leave it. When I press for a response in real life, he can verbally lash out so I try not to say anything, but I get start to feel really hurt the longer he can’t say anything nice.

A few months in (I don’t remember having any bad arguments in this period), I wanted to call the relationship off because I realised it required more compromise than I was willing to give to be satisfied with his quantity of communication, but he said we should give it longer and the fact he didn’t want to let it go was very romantic to me, so we kept dating. Things were pretty good but eventually we started arguing a lot because I felt he didn’t understand depression and he was getting upset that he was getting upset because I was almost always upset. So two years into the relationship, he broke up with me due to being so emotionally stress that it was unhealthy for him (I could not manage the emotional pain of the breakdown of my best friend (also his sister)’s friendship with me). I was distraught but let it go and around six months later, we decided to give the relationship another go.

This time, we didn’t have the depression thing to challenge us and any reservations our family had dissipated. 

Another year passed before the arguments became more frequent again. He felt like I was assuming he was a stern and angry person as I felt he was quick to insult in our arguments and he felt I was way too critical. By pointing out behaviours I was concerned about, I didn’t mean to make him feel it was a part of his identity. 

This year, I felt attracted to a coworker (super hard to deal with as we saw each other often) and was transparent to boyfriend about it but it understandably hurt him. Made me realise our relationship wasn’t healthy because I was looking forward to coworker as he was so happy-go-lucky and relatively easy to get along with. Boyfriend and I decided to give each other space as almost every time we met up, we argued because of past hurts. We were hoping to be able to let go of the resentment we had for each other during this period, but it has made me question how emotionally mature he is... We interact with each other less and less and when we did meet up the last two months, we ended up arguing although was able to resolve it at the end of meeting up.

One of the things that hurt me when we hung out last few weeks was that he paid for dinner and said I could buy dessert if I wanted it. A few months earlier, I asked him not to ask me to pay for things as he can trust I’ll offer to pay different things (like parking or the whole or part of the meal) sometimes and it would be nice if he willingly treated me a whole meal or day. I asked him why he asked me to pay and he replied he had shouted a friend earlier in the week. I said that was a really bad reason; especially in this season of our relationship, I thought he’d put more effort. I probably looked snarky and sounded mean and it took me a little longer to let go (maybe half an hour of awkward eating).

(Financial context: I have worked full time as an allied health tech longer than he has worked (he is a graphic designer, part-time with freelance jobs too). He has bought me shoes, clothes and the most extravagant was hundred dollars if picnic things for my birthday. I’ve bought him shoes, clothes, surprise tickets to concerts, most extravagant gift from me is probably a few hundred dollars travel tickets. So it’s not like he’s a super tight ass... So I’m surprised when he gives the reasoning that he’s tight on money because he treated someone else that week...?)

Is this relationship worth trying again, or is the better thing to do break up with intention to move on and trust if he wants to be with me, he would reach out? No one is initiating hangs at the moment and when we talk over text, we sometimes end up arguing.

**************
TLDR; 

four year relationship hitting the rocks, lots of arguing, stepping on eggshells on both sides — don’t know when to keep going, or when to give up?

Tons in common as far as video games / music / goals, complimented my clothing once, asked me to come over to play video games, etc. She was at work and ran out of cigs, so I pulled a fedora tip move and drove 20 miles to her work to drop her off a pack of smokes, and she ended up imediatly clocking out to take a half day to drive around with me.

She giggles, teases me, gifted me small things, which are all sure signs that she's into me, but she hasn't made any direct signals for me to pick up on.

I told her that I liked her, wanted to get to know her more, and asked her out on a date, but she doesn't seem excited, hasn't expressed interest in me, written or verbal, as a person or sexually.

Bad teeth runs in my family and even though I've taken care of my teeth my whole life, they still don't look good (dm for pics). 
I've been told it will cost thousands to fix and I don't have money for that, I'm already living paycheck to paycheck in a very high cost of living area of California. My dental insurance only covers 1500 a year and my dental work will cost 10k+. I don't have credit either so I can't get a credit card. 

I don't look so bad other than that, maybe a 6/10 with makeup. I have an interesting aesthetic and feel I would be pretty attractive if I had nice teeth and worked out more.

661,c8jr7k,PMUrHoeStories,Don't let people breadcrumb you.,"Courtesy of u/FullDisclosureDaemon - The concept of **Breadcrumbing:**

Can't believe I just now heard this term since apparently it's pretty popular.  Anyway in short it's when someone randomly gives you tiny bits of attention from time to time, just to boost their ego or to keep you interested without actually putting forth any effort.  You become a 'victim' of this by reading into it too much and mistaking this ~~horseshit~~ sporadic attention for attraction and interest.

It's pretty much an attempt to keep you as an option among their other options and definitely far below the people they're actually interested in.  This could come in the form of a random text message one day with suggestive implications, only for the person to ghost you soon after (usually because someone else came along).  This often leads to disappointment for the you, and then elation when the person hits you up again.

Solution?  Get rid of people who do this to you.  It's childish.  It serves only to boost their ego by reassuring themselves that you're still interested when you respond in kind and get your hopes up.",2019-07-03 04:39:48,30,128,dating_advice

I don’t want him to get upset that I doubt it him but I just want to know if I’m being ridiculous In thinking it’s a possibility. So I’m thinking about moving in with him in 6 months but I don’t want to do that if I’m not the one for him. I would be happy for him and support him regardless of any decision of his because I do love him. So here’s what is making me question his sexuality.  1. He hides his porn from me. Weve always been extremely open and I don’t care if he watches it or anything and he knows that but he always deletes his browser history and gets nervous if I ask about it. 2. He does have a high pitched voice. I’m not trying to insinuate anything about stereotypes it’s just a thought. 3. He grew up extremely sheltered and kinda of pretentious but he doesn’t ever put in any sort of work into the yard or helping his dad out around the house or car. 4. He only likes sex if he’s hitting it from the back. 5. He really struggles to keep an erection while having sex, I don’t know if it’s because of the porn (he says he jacks off twice a day) or what but I’ve never once been able to have sex where he’s consistently held a boner the entire time in two years even after supposedly not jacking off for a while, It really kinda shortened the last few times. And he only is able the finish by jacking off to my ass. He always initiates sex but when we start he can’t hold a boner and I can’t make him finish, which I don’t know if it’s me because I could do that with my exes. I suggested viagra and he refused because he wants to train to be an Olympian and it’s “not healthy for him to take with his lifestyle”.

665,c8xcq2,b0227,How can I tell if she wants to go on a second date?,"I’ve been talking to a girl (we’re both 23) for almost a month now (mostly snap and text) and we just went on a first date a week ago. I suggested a couple second date ideas but haven’t really gotten a straight response, mostly “I might be away” or “that could be fun.”  I thought that the first date went well (not exceptionally well, we were both a little nervous) but I kinda get the sense that she doesn’t really want to go out for a second.  She still responds to my texts and everything, so I think there still might be some hope. Any advice for how to tell if she is/isn’t interested?  Don’t want to be a bother if the later is the case.  Also, would appreciate any good second date ideas if she does indeed want to go out again. Cheers!",2019-07-04 03:02:32,7,2,dating_advice

He’s pretty cool so far. There are things about him that make me question if he’d be good fit for me, but for the most part we’re just chilling.

He’s made it clear that he wants us to be exclusively dating. He says it wouldn’t be serious, like a relationship, but we’d be the only people we’d talk to. He says I don’t have to, but he’d prefer that.

I wouldn’t have slept with him so early if I knew he’d want that, honestly. Idk. He says it’s because he likes me, but I feel like sex has sped up dating the process. I just want a dude to like hang out with sometimes, have some fun, and just chill and do cool stuff with. Ya know?

We’ve talked everyday since we went on that date. He just started a new job so he’s been busy and I notice myself checking my phone because I miss talking to him. 

I don’t really want a relationship yet. He says dating is different from a relationship, we’ve established that we aren’t exclusive and we can/will/are talk(ing) to other people. I just didn’t expected myself to get kind of attached to anyone yet. 

I don’t even know if I like this person or if I’m just attaching myself because he’s available??? I could see other people. Like. It’s not that hard to find someone. It’s just weird for me because he was so upfront about liking me???????

I love him to death, he’s empathetic, the best listener, super attractive/tall etc. the perfect man... except he’s still completing his bachelors at a state school and is uncertain about his career path. I pay for ALL of our dates, including all concert tickets, expensive vacations. and food. I work in finance and make well over six figures and graduated from a top 3 school. This has been going on for 2+ years now, I’m exhausted with feeling like the man in the relationship and I just want to be treated like a woman again, and get taken out to dinners or the movies without paying for everything.

I’ve gone on a few dates with other, much more successful and well-educated men. They never lead to anything (I end it after the first 1-3 dates), I’m not having sex or intimacy with them, and all I’m looking for is to get treated to dates. I don’t want to have feelings for them since I’m still very in love with my SO.

671,c8wxie,throwawayacct9988,[20F] Frustrated with trying to date,"My situation is kind of complicated but I almost feel like swearing off dating for good at this point because it's been nothing but frustrating.

Before you lose any pity you have for me or think I'm stuck-up let me explain myself please! lol, yes I know others have it far worse than me and have trouble getting just one person. But I deeply struggle with depression and anxiety so I let things get to my head even if I have an ideal situation.

I won't lie, I'm a young, ""attractive and beautiful"" 20 year old woman. I put those in quotes because I hate calling myself that because I feel so conceited and into myself when I feel the total opposite, trust me. Yes I get guys hitting me up on facebook, have no trouble getting matches on dating apps. But the thing is, it's never what I'm looking for. Sure I want someone average or good looking, but also someone with a nerdy, geeky down to earth personality or just someone that vibes with my outlooks, mindset, sense of humor, etc.

That is very hard to find on dating apps like tinder. Because you see all these good looking guys who are obsessed with smoking weed,no originality or only there for hookups. I deliberately avoid these guys but there are an overwhelming amount of guys on there like that so I get depressed because it only shrinks the dating pool. 

I'm also shy, so guys who come off as over-confident or very social I get almost intimated/scared and instantly swipe left because I can't see myself with them. As for the ones with the awesome personalities, I hate to say this but I feel like it's how everyone else feels? I just don't feel the physical attraction which I wish I can overlook but I can't. 

I met this one guy in April on tinder who was both good looking and had a killer personality. We talked for 3 months via text and snapchat but he would be very interested one minute then avoidant the next and just stopped contacting me, which sucked. After talking to him for months I obviously grew to like him. Now I convinced myself I won't find someone like him again, and going back on tinder just sent me into another depression. I just feel alone and like I'm missing out on things. I've never really dated before (just in highschool for one month lol) where I had my first kiss but that's it. People probably wouldn't believe it if they saw me though. 

I really want to be in a relationship and while it's easy for me to be in one I'm just so picky with what I want and finding the right guy has been nothing but a pain and makes me feel more alone than ever. Everyone is always shocked I'm single but I feel like it's my own fault.

Should I swear off dating apps and just let it happen in the outside world? But then I have to be patient and meet someone and I am not patient. I've been wanting to be in a relationship for a while now and it's just not happening in my life at all.",2019-07-04 02:17:09,11,2,dating_advice
672,c8wwxx,NextLevelMemes,Being lead on?,"Met this girl from work and we hit it off pretty well. She’s been on and off interest wise but for the most part we meet a couple times a week atleast.

It just fucking sucks because we’ve talked about dating and such. It’s been extremely complicated in terms of us as a couple,but it’s pretty clear now that her feelings that she said she had aren’t the same or have just dissolved. 

What’s weird is that she straight up says she still has those feelings....but she doesn’t know what she wants. 

She’s super rad and pretty much fantastic in every way,maybe I’m just not worth it or she has moved on to other things. It’s a terrible feeling though.",2019-07-04 02:15:26,3,2,dating_advice
673,c8rbbw,Jija45,"Am I Doing Something Wrong/Coming Off ""too friendly?"" (tl;dr below)","Soooo, yeah. I (24M) just got the 3rd ""Can I be honest"" text from a woman (honestly my heart drops when I get this shit lol) which came in the lines of the typical ""you cute but I'm not feeling the same vibes we once had when I first met you 3 weeks ago"" shit. And I ask, respectfully (cause taking L's it happens) did I do anything wrong. She said no, I said aight. Peace (and deleted the number and unfollowed her IG)

....but when this is the 3rd time in a row this happens, well...goddamn this is a pattern. I must be doing something wrong? 

So I consider myself a decent looking 5'4 black male that does get with beautiful people from time to time (which leaves me questioning maybe it's nothing wrong with me at all and I'm just going through a bad luck stretch on the apps). I'd like to say a ""good guy"" (even tho I hate that term) and you know respectfully flirtatious and goofy and make intentionally corny jokes while keeping it intelligent from time to time y'know? And during dates I always try to make room for her to talk and ask them questions (while keeping it natural of course) 

The problem is (from friends that's keeping it honest), I'm either being too friendly to the point that I'm starting to be seen as nothing more than a friend type person. (which fine whatever, but because they're not really looking for that, just rather we stop talking. which...ok. cool) 

The problem is....we been consistently talking and meeting for like 3 weeks and shawty would be texting me MAD OD. So it's like......why you do all that constant communication back and forth texting and calling if this was gonna be the end result? Why give me mad compliments and shit when (if the conversation goes there and it's appropriate) I break down how sex should be about women first and I get ""women like me appreciate men like you'd"" from you. It just gets hella discouraging and starts to rise up feelings of trust issues or jaded ness (which I won't succumb to. I'm better than that.) cause in the back of my mind no matter how into you the other person may seem, you gotta always know they can just up and disappear. Hell or even ghost. 

I've come to peace with the fact that maybe because of my transparency on looking for more casual/fwb relationships can be a deterrent (which, is funny cause....I thought the whole thing against us men was us NOT being straight forward about what our intentions are or what we're looking for)....even though the women I talk to tell me they're not looking for anything either. But i don't know lol 

I've also come to peace that this app shit is probably starting to be played out and I gotta just go outside more (even though the 2 times I've tried RL aint worked out and either ghost or just naturally died out. It's worked out more on the apps than IRL.) 

The too friendly thing is weird cause the otherside of that is the manipulative and emotionally closed off cat (which I know specific situations where I could've did just that) but it wouldn't go right with my conscience. So places like trp or seduction kinda leave a bad taste in my mouth lol.

tl;dr: I keep making progress with womens but then they end up losing whatever feelings they got for me weeks in after we been talking and meeting. Is this a fault of my own? If so what do I do?",2019-07-03 18:00:00,7,10,dating_advice

Mostly shes more of a traveler /outgoing. Im mostly a homebody but do occasionally go out. Shes also depending on your view can be a bit spontaneous or impulsive. In the early going i had some concerns because she appeared to be flighty She would quit assignments at first sign of trouble. Shortly after we met she had quit her job that she was at for 11 mos. Then she told she was surprised that she stayed that long. She mentioned that her X called her unstable although he turned out to be married. 

Anyways weve been having a constant discussion about all of this. Mostly the problem stems from that she has wants to go out almost all the time.  Even when weve have gone out she say lets go do this. We had talk last week because i said she could be a bit impulsive. So she said describe to her what i meant by that. So i gave her a few examples. She agreed ( albeit tentatively) that she can be an sees my point of view.  No later than this she wants to pick up a bike 40 miles away an this idea just came out the blue.  Meanwhile i had to double back an also drop her off at work which was 30 miles in the opposite direction. 

Ive been telling myself its growing pains but im starting to wonder if its just a incompatibility issue we are having here. She also has a bit of control issue. Something that her best friend warned me about early on. My problem is she wants to move closer to me so shes looking for new rooms to rent.

679,c8v8xd,squiggsrm81,"I (M24) have never had a girlfriend, how do I improve my mindset on this?","It's not the fact the I've never had a girlfriend that worries me, it's the fear that I never will. 

A lot of the advice I see is the same stuff: Work on yourself, be more confident in who you are, work out, find new hobbies, etc. I have successfully been able to do these things of the past few years, it sometimes it feels like my chances here in the US are the same.

I have come a long way in the area of self-improvement since high school and have grown a lot as a person. I have hobbies (language learning, music, dance), I exercise regularly and am physically healthy. I'm introverted and shy but am a sociable person. I like being around people.

People say that my self-confidence is what I need to focus on the most, which I agree to, but it still blows my mind why this seems to make me 99.9% undatable to any girl in my area when in college (which I recently graduated from)

* I was actively involved in student organizations, held leadership positions, was even asked to run for president of different clubs a couple times. 
* I had (and still do have) great friendships. I can even name people (one who asked me to be her mentor in a campus org) who went out of their way to tell me they looked up to me and saw me as a leader. 
* The two jobs I wanted to get the most, I got. 
* I performed on stage and made audiences genuinely laugh and cry. I was well-known and respected at my university, both by students, faculty, and staff.

 **I can be successful in literally every aspect of life and get what I want, but for whatever reason in order to be in a romantic relationship none of this seems to be good enough, as if it all just boils down to having big muscles, a fake haircut, and an arrogant personality.**  Like seriously! I want to emphasize this. My confidence can find me friends, jobs, and praises, yet a relationship seems to have some unknown, abstract quality that I don't meet. 

I have tried to ask people out before. I've only been rejected or friendzoned. I've tried dating apps and got **zero matches** besides scammers, which means girls looked at my profile photos and instantly decided I'm not worth their time before I could even say hello. I feel like I'm a dating 'dessert' where I'm almost willing to settle for anyone who I find attractive enough and shows signs of interest. And any potential opportunity that comes my way feels like a Groupon sale that I got to act quick on before it's too late and my chance is gone.

My only other con people might say is that I am too nice. But I am 'nice' because I want to be, because my upbringing taught me to be a decent person and I feel happier being kind to others. I don't act this way so that I can get something 'in return'. This is just part of who I am. 

To be honest I am less looking for advice and more looking for someone to relate to on this. Any time google search 'never had a girlfriend' I get the same advice columns and videos. It'd be really nice to hear if anyone has had the same/similar experiences as me.",2019-07-03 23:25:23,5,3,dating_advice

Basically long story short, a mutual friend introduced us at a tailgate almost two years, we hooked up. Didn't talk again. Said mutual friend had an NYE 2019 party that both of us were at, we hooked up again. And then we started seeing each other periodically since then. I kinda viewed the relationship platonically at first, but lately I've been vacillating about what I want because he's always really sweet to me and makes sure to take care of me whenever we're together and he's also made me more confident and trusting in intimate settings. On the other hand, we never really talk/we haven't been on any official dates or anything, so it's kinda like meh. I feel like I know who he is, but I'd like to know more about him if that makes sense, and I'm not exactly sure how to overcome that barrier.

Another big issue is I just graduated and I'm moving cities for my job in the next 2 months- mind you my new city is only 1.5 hours away by car, but still leaving the city I've grown up in so big life transition.

I've kinda been up and down the rollercoaster a bit; sometimes I'm like yeah I'm interested in making this something more and then other times I'm like yeah... not worth it.

Last summer me and my friends started hanging out with these group of girls and one of the girls liked me. I decided not to date her because I was to focused on my business and saw that every month she was dating a new guy and I didn’t want to be just another guy. Time went on and the school year began and she found the guy she was going to date all school year. I regretted my decision right after she started dating this guy and it ate away at me all year. The boyfriend is a sophomore and she is a senior. Anyways we both just graduated and are going to the same community college this year. The boyfriend will stay in high school as a junior. I would say I am a good friend of hers and if she broke up with him she would be interested in me again. During their relationship this year they broke up a total of 4 times but got back together almost the next day. I have heard some negative things about their relationship however they are still together which is confusing. I am just wondering what are the chances they break up ever? I am going to give some random details because I don’t know how to put them in order. I go to the gym with her 3 times a week. They are constantly texting each other about something. I run a business that makes 60k a year in passive income and have a significant amount saved up. I have went from a tall skinny lanky kid when she first liked me to a tall stronger looking man thanks to working out and growing a beard. Which she complements me on every time I see her. Anyways if you had to put a percentage on them staying together what would it be? Also any tips or advice you have please comment. Thanks,2019-07-04 04:20:31,1,1,dating_advice

One thing that baffles me about him is that he never pulls through with plans. He asked me out and planned on our first date via Bumble. For our subsequent dates, he makes the suggestion in person – usually during the date, but I don't hear any concrete plans from him over the next few days. When I don't, I end up reaching out to him to solidify our plans. He always says yes and seems eager when I ask him out/solidify plans. I think I messed up by showing more investment than him.

After our 4th date, I didn't hear from him. I figured he ghosted and frankly I was annoyed he wasn't pulling through with his plans, so I didn't reach out. A week later, he DM's me on Insta to make conversation. We talk for a few days but he didn't ask me out. I figured since he was a lost cause, I'll reach out once more just for one more drinks, because why not. He's fun to hang out and I'm not expecting anything with him anymore.

Our last date was great and it was fun! But then he did it again. He said, ""We should do X. There's this bar I want to take you to."" Still haven't heard from him. I'm tired of this and it's taking the fun out of dating. At this point, I'm starting to get mixed feelings but I still want to see where this goes.

He is allowed by law to meet him once every two weeks for a few hours but his ex often rejects these dates. It seemed to bother him a lot, so he doesn't seem like a bad guy. Custody is kind of weird I guess.

So, do you have any tips or advice for me that could help me handle that situation? I really want to meet him again. I don't want him to feel weird if it comes up again. Is there anything I should keep in mind if I consider dating him longterm? 
Thank you so much in advance.",2019-07-03 21:34:56,11,3,dating_advice

We then started to know each other alone in the woods and things got really intense, really fast, we had this special connection, and we both had alot of sexual tension, we were flirting alot, touching each other alot etc. Then the days pass and the day after the camp ends I hit her up on Instagram to set up a date but for no reason she blocked me, I'm really confused I know I must move on but I wanna know what do you think I did wrong or maybe it was her idk what's your thoughts on this?",2019-07-03 23:43:51,2,2,dating_advice

We became really good friends online in the last eight months.  Six months ago I asked her out and she said she saw me as a good friend.  I thought about it for a day, decided I didn't want to throw the friendship away, and decided to remain friends with her.  I figured over enough time I would naturally move on, except now I'm thinking this was a mistake. She seems to give a lot of hints that she's interested, but this could also be in my head.  We spend a lot of time playing games together and chatting over text, and I enjoy that time, but every few days I come around to being incredibly frustrated about being stuck in this position.  It's not healthy.  On the other hand, if I walk away, I also walk away from the friendship that I DO enjoy, and also a few other friends I've made through her.

692,c8rjh5,mrnonamex,What should I do moving forward with this girl?,"So I met this girl on tinder about a month ago. We chatted for a bit before asking her out on a date

First and second date both went amazing she would text me afterwards and tell me she had a great time and we should do it again soon and at the end of the second date she actually kissed me. 

Around a week after our first date we were planning a third date. We set it up and we were both excited. 

The day before the date she tells me she wants to keep things casual for now but is still down to go and the day of the date she tells me she isn’t sure what she’s looking for and s bunch more in a wall of a text message

I tell her it’s all good and no hard feelings and we’re cool she asks if we can keep our snap streak

A few days later I make a new tinder and am on the hunt. She snaps me that night and says “love the fact that we unmatched on tinder” we go back and forth for a little about it and eventually just stop talking for the night

The next day I felt bad so I apologized and we got on the subject of us, and she says how she wouldn’t mind going out again but doesn’t know what she can promise as far as that and I’m cool with it

Over the next few days we go off again then on and then off again over the same reason of her not knowing what she wants and just recently got out of a relationship and whatnot

So I leave it there and we’re still cool I tell her if she wants to try again in the future I’m open to it and she tells me that I can reach out to her and talk to her whenever I’d like and that she’ll keep that in mind

A couple days past that I hit her up just with something I know she’s interested in and just share it with her as a friendly gesture. And a couple days past that I just comment on her snap story telling her she looks cute in the dress she was in and from that we’ve been talking since

I’m halfway between cutting it off so I don’t end up catching feelings and upset and trying to go for it again but this time from a different less straight forward approach since it feels like she’s interested she just gets cold feel when she feels like things are heading a certain point",2019-07-03 18:17:45,12,3,dating_advice

I have gone on a lot of dates and the two that were successful didn't lead to anything because both guys pretended to want a relationship when they were really just using me for sex.

So now I'm wondering if I should just settle for a hookup situation from the start, because I'm sick of getting feelings and getting hurt. I'm thinking maybe finding a relationship in college is just not realistic because no guys seem to want anything serious, and even if they did, the relationship would always be long distance at some point. The guy I have in mind for a fwb situation thing is very sweet and attractive and lives in my hometown as well as going to the same college as I do, but has made it clear that he's not looking for anything serious. It would just be very convienent to get the physical affection and sex that I crave from him without the risk of getting hurt, but at the same time I still want an actual boyfriend.

My friends said that apparently they heard him talking about me to his friends when I was away/looking at me etc.

 I couldn't ask for his number or anything because we were both busy. So I added him on facebook after the event, he instantly recognised me and even mentioned that we kept smiling at each other! 

I asked him if he fancied a drink and he said ""yes, definitely!"" adding that it's indeed way better than facebook. 

The thing is: he literaly takes hours to answer even a simple thing. 

He told me that he wasn't into social media and that he often takes hours to answer. 

But, he uses social medias a lot for his work, so I think he's just afraid that I stick to him or something and he wanted to warn me. I proposed a day for the date and he said he would tell me when he's around my town, maybe on friday.

We talk nearly every day but he often goes through periods where he wants to “be alone and talk to nobody”. He says he’s going through one of the hardest times in his life right now. I think he’s depressed. He’ll be so attentive and sweet for a few days and then totally disappear for the next few. I’m very understanding of all of this but I can’t help but feel upset when I hear nothing from him. For example, our latest conversation:

Me: Hey, are you ok?
Him: Hey, sorry I haven’t been on here. I’m not ignoring you, I promise. I guess I’ll just come and go. It’s not you.
Me: What do you mean you’ll just come and go?
Him: I have a habit of disappearing and then I feel guilty for it.
Me: I guess I understand...but floating in and out between some kind of interest/excitement and some kind of apathy, feels a bit dismissive to me. But I’m not sure that matters because I’m not sure what’s going on here. Are you ok?
Him: I just don’t want to be responsible for your happiness or sadness
(I didn’t reply for a while, as didn’t know what to say, so he messaged again)
Him: I’m being unfair. You haven’t done anything wrong. I’m sorry. I guess I just felt a pressure to communicate even when I didn’t want to communicate with anyone. It’s my problem so I apologise. I just need to be alone right now.
Me: If you don’t feel like talking to anyone, all you need to do is say so, and I will respect it. I understand and I don’t expect you to feel guilty for that. I’m really not here to put pressure on you.
Him: Ok thank you. I hope all is well with you.

This is so hard for me. I know he’s going through a tough time and I don’t want to undermine that at all. He always tells me not to take it personally but it’s incredibly hard not to. How do I deal with him without being too pushy? Is it unreasonable for me to expect more communication? Do I just leave him be? When it’s good, it’s amazing, and we get along like I’ve never experienced with anyone before, but then it’s always followed by negative periods like this.",2019-07-03 22:44:43,13,1,dating_advice
707,c8usdl,Ohhh_Em_Ghee,Should I reach out to let him know how I feel after he ended our relationship?,"I've been seeing this guy for the last 8 months. He owns his business that he just started about 18 months ago. Spring and Summer are peak season for him so the last few months I haven't been able to have much time with him. I've done what I could to be supportive and encouraging but also let him have space. We'd still have lunch once or twice a week, but while he was working.

A few days ago, he ended things with me over lunch. Everything was fine until I was about to leave. He seemed off, so I asked what was wrong and he simply said he's too busy to be with anyone right now and he doesn't want to waste my time. I asked a lot of questions (Is there someone else? How long have you felt this way? What if I don't think it's a waste of my time? Etc) but he was silent, so not knowing what else I could do or say, I left and went back to work. He hasn't reached out since. 

Is it worth me reaching out to tell him how I feel? I cared a lot about him, and his drive and ambition and work ethic were really the things I liked most about him. I didn't complain about his schedule. I even helped him get some additional business leads. I kept myself busy while he was busy, waiting until things were going to slow down. 

He didn't take the time to let the breakup be a conversation where I'd have the opportunity to say how I felt, and like anyone, I want the closure.  I am not wanting to make him feel bad for ending things with me, but I feel like I deserve to be heard.

709,c8rn7i,thetallbrownguy,Why is it hard?,"Just a little bit of context. I'm an Indian guy who has been in the US for almost three years. I have been on dates with a number of women of all races. A good number of them were white. It is not because I have a fetish but it is because they are such a huge demographic back in college. I'm about 6'2"" and 195 pounds. I'm average built; I used to be over weight but I am working on getting more fit. I also have dark brown skin and okay looks. 

  
Almost everything that has happened until now were just for two or three dates. After that I get the classic reply of ""You're a nice guy but I think we should just be friends."" I envy people who hold their hands and walk. I envy people when one just falls on someone else's shoulder. I don't know if it is all right to say, but I envy interracial couples most of all! It would be nice to have someone to share the little things in life won't it? Girls talk to me but only up to a limit. This one person whom I really like, we still write letters in 2019, one day she is super nice and the other day she doesn't even care if I exists. Thinking back I realize that I will never know what it would feel like to be in a relationship even when I was 22. It hurts if I like someone and only later to find out that they are already in relationship with someone else. I go mad about it. I know this behavior can be self destructive but I don't know what to do about it. Sometimes it is sad when you experience something and you want to share it with someone but you have no one to share it with. Also, when you get home from work, it is kinda sad that you don't have anyone waiting for you at home. Sometime I lack sleep because of it. Other times I am just so frustrated. I sit inside my car and yell myself out while I'm on highway. I am not the kind of guy who'd want to get laid on the first few dates. I want to feel something before I engage in physical relationships with a woman. 

  
I don't know why I am rambling about all this here. I don't know what kind of comments I will be getting for this. Maybe I will just pickup and feel myself from someone's comment. Also, I am curious if there is any stereotypes about dating Indian guys in the US.

715,c8pid7,RadiantIntention,Am I being played/tested? What should I do?,"Hey guys and girls I'm in a little bit of a dilemma. I met a really cute and interesting girls some time ago in dancing class. I'm 17 she is 16. Now the second time we danced with each other I asked her to go for cocktails with me after class which she did. I personally felt like we really hit it off and we had quite a few things in common, so the next time I saw her I decided to ask her out again. This time to do something unrelated outside of dancing class during the weekends. She told me that she was busy and out of town during the next two weekends but said she'd be up to do something at a later date. Well after the two weeks were over I decided to ask her out again and the next time we went dancing we went for some ice cream together. Now since the summer break just started I used the last dancing class to ask her out again, this time to the amusement park and she responded: "" Sure, but since I work during the summer break I'll write you on Monday when I know how long I'll be at work each day."" Didn't get a message on Monday so I hit her up on Tuesday to ask how things where looking and now we are gonna go out tomorrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that bothers me is that she didn't write me on Monday and that the one time we went out for ice cream she also couldn't confirm any plans immediately but put it off to messaging me another day.

What made me quite happy is that she did remember my birthday and wrote me at like 7 in the morning.

For some reason everyone thinks just because there’s people consistently interested in me I need to be dating, and they almost make it out to be weird... constantly trying to set me up, dig into why I choose to be single etc. it gets exhausting having other people care about my relationship life more than me. They act like it’s an issue. I like being single but it’s comfortable... I want to venture out, but I can’t bring myself to waste energy on people who don’t fill a certain part of me.

722,c8orxo,PhillipFry833,Could I have done something differently? How do I move on?," Background: I (24M) developed feelings for a pretty good friend (24F) of mine back in college a year ago. Nothing really ever came of it because at the time, she had a bf. We talked about it before too, she knew I had feelings for her. She told me she had thought about us being together before but really valued loyalty and couldn't do that to her at the time bf. After that, I moved for a job and we sort of lost touch (a ""hello"" here or there).

Flash forward a few months ago and we reconnect. She moved back home (nearby) and broke up with her ex early in the year. She tells me she's just been casually dating and doesn't want to have anything serious because of med school applications, current full-time job, and breaking up with her ex was very emotionally tolling. We hang out a couple times and I start liking her again. I recently asked her out on a date and she rejected me saying again that she wasn't looking for anything serious and if we were to date, she knew it wouldn't be casual. She also asked if I wanted to be friends and I told her I didn't think I could do it without always wanting something more.

I'm pretty sad about it, obviously because of the rejection but also because I lost a friend (I was being honest with myself). Idk... I know the right move now is to not reach out to her anymore and move on, but its hard to get this out of my head. I really believe she meant what she said about not being ready for a serious relationship again (she's so busy nowadays), but sometimes it just goes in my head that maybe its me.

I guess I'm asking for people's take on the whole situation and some great advice on how to move on. I've been delving into different activities lately to find a hobby (coaching soccer, learning piano) but again it pops in my head every now and then.",2019-07-03 14:31:02,5,3,dating_advice

She's made me re-think some things about myself, and not in a bad way. Just made me realize some of my thinking was a bit shallow, or that I want her to be happier around me, and happy to be myself.

So some things I've learned:

\-Not having media interests in common doesn't mean you still won't get along.

\-Just because they aren't interested in what you have to say 100% of the time doesn't mean they are second guessing your relationship.

\-Insecurities are fine. Just don't make them your therapist.

\-You don't have to tolerate being spoken to rudely.

\-You are two individuals. They fell for you for you, not because they wanted a clone.

Both of us had been really busy with the start of the summer so we hadn’t been able to hang out until earlier this week. Leading up to this he hadn’t been the best texter, but I personally don’t like communicating over text so I was happy to let it slide. Because of this, I didn’t have high hopes for the date but decided to go to see what would happen, and it went great! In person we’re able to carry on a conversation and later on we cuddled and watched a movie. At the end of the date I could tell he was kinda nervous but subtly encouraged him to walk me to my car and he ended up kissing me and we made out for a minute or two. I’m pretty sure it was both of our first “real” kisses, so it was pretty sloppy both we both laughed it off and commented how we “needed to work out that.”

It’s been a day and a half since the date and we still haven’t texted. I’m thinking I should say something since he isn’t one to initiate texting conversation (I’m not either, so it’s an interesting situation).

729,c8snf0,pm_me_ur_fave_murder,I don’t know if i can do this.,"I’ve been dating this guy for about 3.5 months now (I’m 25, he’s 32). He’s pretty great. We have a lot of fun together. We laugh a lot, like more than i laugh with a lot of people. I do like him, and he likes me a lot as well. 

My issue is this, he has some serious bouts of depression and anxiety. Which i can handle, i can handle sad, i can handle anxious. But he doesn’t do anything to better himself. Since we’ve been dating he’s had maybe 3 little breakdowns and they’re usually all centered around the same things, money, his job, finances, not living his life to the fullest. Usually legitimate things that most people stress about. I try not to harp on him about it because i know it won’t make anything better, i always try to just listen and offer advice if he asks for help or reaches out for it. He’s going through a little episode right now and it’s lasted about 4 days now, longest one yet. Hes stressed about the usual stuff he’s stressed about. He was talking to me about all this BEFORE the episode started and i was trying to offer some easy solutions to help him out, like yoga when he’s feeling scatterbrained or anxious, I’ve bought him some self help books to read to help him get through his anxiety. I’ve told him about apps that are cheaper than therapy (which he admits he needs but can’t afford it right now) but act just the same. And with every solution i have him, he rebutted with an excuse. “That takes too much energy in the morning. That’s not my thing. Maybe” 

When he works he has to be there by 7 am and he usually wakes up around 4:30. I suggested that instead of jumping on his computer right away until he has to leave, why doesn’t he take some time for himself and make his coffee and read some books. Or play on the app I’ve mentioned. Try doing some light activity to get blood flowing. But he wasn’t into that idea. On Monday he got to leave work early which was great for him because he was already going through his emotions. I asked him what he was doing around 8pm (he had been home since 5) and he said he was playing on his computer. I asked if he cracked open any reading material or tried working out or anything at all and his response was “I’m too tired. Thought about it, but I’m just too tired to do any of that right now” 

I get being so low and down that you just don’t want to, or can’t, do anything. But i get the feeling that he doesn’t want help. That he likes complaining about these things that are fixable, but doesn’t want to take the steps to actually fix them. And i cannot be with someone who doesn’t want to help themselves. I’ve expressed that to him and he says he understands but he’s not making any progress at all. He’s worked everyday this week and every morning he has yet to push himself to read anything or do ANYTHING that will help him. And I’m getting tired of it. I don’t want to be the one to fix him, and he isn’t acting like he wants that from me, but i cannot help someone who will not help themselves. 

I’m at a crossroads. I like this guy. When he’s good things are great. But when he’s not good things suck. He knows he needs help but refuses to reach out or do anything to help himself.

I’ve been in a relationship for almost 5 months now. My boyfriend and I live 120 miles apart. I originally met him on a dating app and if it wasn’t for the distance I wouldn’t have actually gotten together with him. But now the distance is becoming so hard to deal with. I’ve met up with him twice (Once on our 4 moths then on Tuesday) but because of my dad and how strict and overprotective he is, he only comes up to see me and I feel like I’m not doing anything or playing my part in our relationship.

I enjoy when he comes up though because it’s nice to see him. However I constantly miss him and it’s driving me crazy. I don’t want to break up with him cause I love him but I crave getting to spending time like we always do.

We’re planning on moving in together when we’re 18 and I’m going to university but he is going into the army in 10 weeks and he’s gonna be based in different locations so I would only be living at home alone until he finishes for the holiday breaks or until he decides to leave the army when he’s 25-27. The point in us moving in was to lessen the distance between us but he could be further than we are now.

He invited me over to watch TV after a few hours, and I told him I don’t want to have sex, if that’s what he was trying for. (I’m currently in a phase where I want to be more serious with the people I sleep with.) He was okay with that and reassured me he’s not the “Netflix and chill” type. 

Next time we hung out, we went to his friend’s birthday party and he introduced me to a lot of people over and over.  We slept over that night together, at my suggestion. I also said no sex. We had some physical intimacy, but no sex. 

It’s been about once a week we hang out since, but yesterday I reached out and he was out with a friend. I understand he was hanging out.

I had nice conversations with a lots of guys and went on dates with many of them, nothing really came out of it. Mostly because despite that I have it in my bio and made it clear in conversation too that I'm looking for a relationship, not a sex partner, they were still only looking for a sex partner, just played the game to try to fuck me anyways. I feel like most of the dudes there either just want to fuck or are totally awkward and can't talk to girls. Obviously there are exceptions but I haven't succeed to find them, at least who would also click with me. I just deleted Tinder and I'm not planning to use any dating apps anymore because it's just exhausting. 
I know the default answers are ""don't look for it and the right person will come when you don't expect it"", yeah, that's what I did in the past 4 years, I don't know, should I wait 15 more to have something happen?

Not gonna happen, I don't have the time or the mood for that and I have social anxiety with strangers so I can't really make new friends like this. Whatever hobby it would be I would be doing it alone in the crowd. In general I get to know less people than others in a span of time most likely, because of that.
Or go to a bar, concert, whatever, have some drinks with random dudes? Oh, so they can try to just fuck me and forget me as well.

746,c8q9xv,Winterseared,Can’t tell if dating or just hanging out (I’m 24M she’s 21F),"So I went out with this girl from work a few weeks ago (we both got promoted alongside each other for the same position and went out to celebrate) and we got really drunk and made out. 

Everything is cool, no problem. Sent her home in an Uber cause she blacked out and life goes on. Fast forward a couple weeks (she was on vacation then had minimester finals) to two nights ago. We went out, same spot, hung out but didn’t get as drunk (still drunk tho). Didn’t make out or anything and we decided we’d go to the beach the next day (both of our families have houses there) so I crashed at her house and we left in the morning. She put me in her guest room and then went to her room. 

Yesterday we got to the beach and went our separate ways with our families for a bit (I did meet her uncle on arrival though, hit it off he’s cool)

Eventually I asked her if she wanted to go out again and she was down. We met and started at this little dive place, she told me I looked cute when she saw me which was a confidence boost. 

Dive bar was lame so we walked a few streets over to a club. After a few drinks and some 1 on 1 we end up grinding on the dance floor, like aggressively 😂 then we went and made out again for a bit. 

We left the club and walked across the street to chill on the beach at night for a bit. Nothing happened but she ended up puking then we were covered in sand so we left. Went to her fam’s house and met her younger brother and we play some of the same video games and have other common interests so we got along great too, I think he said something along the lines of “I like this one” in reference to me but I don’t remember if that’s exactly how it was said. 

We all chilled til like 3:30am and I was kinda thinking I was gonna get lucky so I stuck around. Eventually she started nodding off and her brother offered to carry her to her room and then they offered me another guest room. 

I opted to just Uber back to my family’s place. 

I’m just confused about what’s going on. Like am I dating this girl? Cause we’ve gone out a few times in the last few weeks and we get along great. She also said “bye love!” When I left last night? Do I just suck at closing? And she also mentioned last night she’s just “enjoying her single life” and said she’s “an emotionless piece of shit” in reference to like loving someone. 

So idk what to think guys. Curious what y’all think. Any other questions about any circumstances or details for clarification I’ll be glad to answer.",2019-07-03 16:37:28,3,1,dating_advice

It lasted one and a half year and ended badly so I went out there and have my way with other girls on college or dating apps.

We didn't gave a name to the relationship so we were like friends but at the same time bf and gf. We're in spring break now and only doing facetime because we live in different areas. We're mostly friends now. I had feelings for her but didn't open up. Now I'm getting over it because I feel like she's not into a relationship. The thing is I love my ""Me times"" I enjoy myself. Hell I didn't even need any kind of relationship for so long but since that girl came into my life I begin to have a need for a SO. I'm talking with a girl on Tinder since 2 days.

755,c8mxc7,J_Fighter,I'm lost my best friend to his girlfriend,"Bare with me there is a bit of backstory. 

So me (19m) and this best friend (19m) have been for friends 3 years. In the last year he has gotten a girlfriend (19f) which was great I was happy for him and supported the relationship but then a month ago he completely stopped messaging me and my other friends (his friends too) which was weird but when confronted said he was busy in college and didn't have much time. Thing is he only has college 2 days a week so we knew something was up. He was supposed to come down for the summer and stay at home but out of nowhere he decides he wants to stay in his college accommodation to be near his girlfriend.

We just left that there to avoid a argument but then his girlfriend texts another one of my friends girlfriends (18f) attacking her because she was texting my best friend about a birthday that was being planned. She attacked my other friends girlfriend calling her all kind of names and accused her of cheating on my other friend(20m). Obviously this was way out of line so we talked to my best friend to see why it happened (we never really met his girlfriend only once). He defended her which was expected but since that day things became extremely awkward. He finally came down for the summer a week later and met with us, everything was normal and didn't feel too awkward but then he ghosted me for 2 days and refused to talk to me. So I sent him a long ass message asking if he even wanted to be my friend anymore to which he said no.

He has now cut off his entire friend group for a girl (not the first time this happened in our group) and he inst listening to anything I'm saying. His girlfriend is very manipulative and it feels like she has brainwashed him. What hurts the most is he left our friendship for a 1 year relationship like it was nothing.

If anyone could just help me wrap my head around what to do I'd appreciate it. I have felt so lost the last few days and I find it hard to leave my bed during the day I never thought that it would hurt this bad but it feels like I've been broken up with.",2019-07-03 11:24:57,3,2,dating_advice
756,c8ltoa,MrFunnyPantss,I got absolutely no idea why is this girl showing interest in me...,"So let me begin with a little background about myself. I'm 23 year old guy, just finished college for a engineer of radiology, I have a bit of a sport history, 3 years of gym behind me and still going so I'd say I'm physicaly fit. And yea, weird internet-ish sense of humor. 
I wouldn't consider myself anywhere near handsome but I've been told that allegedly I'm a catch but in my eyes I'm a 5-5.5 at best. 
I've got a not so successful love and dating life. From elementary and trough college I've expressed and showed interest in decent amount of girls only to be left with bitter taste of rejection and less motivation to seek any further relationship. Which lowered my self esteem. 
There was a couple of dates here and there with some of the girls but nothing too serious..

A couple of weeks ago I've matched with this girl (F21) on tinder, she's really cute, we've got decent number of same interests, we laughed a lot to my dumb jokes and we hit off really well I think. We've been on 2 dates, 3rd set for this friday. There was kissing a bit of cuddling. When we started to engage in physical contact, she actually showed interested and affection towards me, I could say maybe even more than myself and  in most cases I'm the one that gives love and don't recieve a good portion of it back. I felt needed, just a thought that someone showed a bit of caring and interest in me, got me all warped up. While out and I told her that I like her and she said she feels the same about me. 
WHY THE FUCK IS THAT, YOU TELL ME??!? 

I'm not interesting in my mind, I'm not good looking, and when theres bunch of better looking guys and surely more interesting ones out there. 

Second thing is that I'm really tired of playing games over the text that I experienced eith past girls, wait this amount of time to respond, dont show your feeling, dont care much bla bla
I'm tired of that stuff. I want to be honest with this girl, especially when I've noticed that I feel really relaxed around her I'm joking around all of the time with her, which I dont do if I'm all closed up, and I have 0 guard up when I'm out with her.

I want to be honest with her, ask her what is shr expecting of this, and also I don't want to rush thing with her because I dont't want to fuck up, ruin this and I also want to get to know her better. 

Tl;dr be me, suck in finding a right person, find a right person, scared of ruining the thing with her, question yourself why does she like me, probably gonna fuck up this one also...

Ok so first of all I’m home for the summer and I’ll be going back to college (2 hours away) in 2 months. I talked to this guy on bumble for a week and we planned to meet at the Cheesecake Factory the week after for the first date. It went pretty well so we went to mini golf and the beach at night. We were both kind of awkward with each other until the beach, then it just felt really natural. So we text after and the next day I was supposed to hang out with another guy (lol) and they cancelled so we went on another date in the middle of the night, from 11:30-5 in the morning. We went into Boston for cannolis. It felt a little awkward for a while and I was starting to feel unsure but as soon as we got into the car again I felt better. I said we should go to his place so we started watching a movie and then had sex. We cuddled for two hours after and then he offered to let me stay but I had to get back home. Again we’ve been texting a bunch since and are going on another date tonight. He’s extremely sweet and does little things like holding doors open and remembering everything I say. We’re constantly holding hands and he refuses to let me pay for anything. He seems really interested and I am too and everything feels right. Is it too fast though? I haven’t been even considering talking to anyone else.

761,c8owv9,iShitPost37,"Dating gives me anxiety, and ultimately makes me want to stop pursuing it.","\[22 Male\] First of all, for the most part when I'm not pursuing a relationship, I am generally happy. I have plenty of hobbies, friends, academic pursuits that keep me going. But what happens is that sexual urges will kick in, and ill go in phases where I start pursuing women. But when that happens, it makes me so unfocused in my life, and distracts me from the things that make me truly happy . Mostly Ill desperately swipe on tinder, but I have the chance I'll start talking to a cute girl in my class or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me tell you what exactly about dating makes me anxious. Approach women makes me anxious(which is really common thing, and is just a byproduct of evolution from when we used to live in small tribes) trying to create a good first impression makes me anxious, trying to get the ball rolling and continuing building attraction makes me anxious, fear of getting flaked on from a date makes me anxious, fear of being ghosted makes me anxious, and getting ghosted makes me feel anxious. 

&amp;#x200B;

I kinda take failure with women to heart to. Not knowing why things didn't work out give me anxiety too. So then I just come up with dozens of theories of why it didn't work out. So i get frustrated and will just swipe for days on tinder, look at porn, or masturbate and talk dirty to some low quality chicks on tinder and snap chat. 

&amp;#x200B;

But anyways, I don't know I just kinda want to avoid dating all together. I get attached easily to women. It just feels like I'm just better off without it.",2019-07-03 14:43:12,5,1,dating_advice

I had to go away on vacation around that time. I came back and started chatting to her again but I had to go away again for a week. Now she's told me that she'd love to go out with me but she's been seeing another guy.

I don't really care since we haven't even met yet and aren't exclusive or anything.

764,c8oplw,thebuttcake,"An old FWB [23M] asked me [23F] out on a date, it went well, but he hasn’t reached out ever since. Should I take this as disinterest?","TLDR: I have a feeling this old friend of mine only asked me out as post breakup loneliness and his lack of reaching out seems to confirm this. I’m not sure if I’m right thinking this and am wondering whether I should ask him out to a movie soon, but would rather avoid rejection and more confusion. 



4 years ago we hooked up a few times but never really went out on dates or considered a relationship. I’m pretty sure back then he said he didn’t want anything serious and I was all “cool girl” about it, but I can’t remember whether I actually wanted to date him or not. He meets a girl one day and we stop fooling around, he ends up dating her for 3 years lol. 


A few weeks ago I reinstalled  instagram and saw a message from him weeks prior, asking me out for a drink or dinner. I checked his profile and yup, no pictures of gf in sight. My hunch was that he was probably lonely and remembered me from back in the day. We started chatting and made plans. 

There was a night where we got to talking about our breakups, and of course he totally spilled his guts out about his ex. Girl cheated on him and he was/still is pretty heartbroken. He claimed it happened a few months ago, which I think is kinda recent. But he’s been focusing on school and work, and seems to have a good mindset regarding the breakup. 


Anyways, after that conversation he never really initiated any talk with me after. The day before the date came I was the one to reach out and confirm. Idk, I guess I got the vibe that he wasn’t as enthusiastic anymore but that’s just me reading between the lines. We ended up going out and it went really fine, he took me out to dinner and a movie, picked me up and everything. We made good conversation and he’s just a sweet guy, always has been. By the end of the date, as he was dropping me off, he kinda just turned to say bye really abruptly and said “keep in touch”. I was disappointed that we didn’t make any concrete plans for another date and I guess this awkward interaction solidified my hunch that this date was just a one-time thing. 


I texted him after thanking him again and saying I had a great time. He said the same. But ever since then (almost a week ago) he hasn’t reached out again. 


Am I wrong in taking this entire thing as a sign that he wasn’t actually interested, he was probably just wanting to get back out there post breakup but then realized it’s not what he wants yet? I really noticed a shift after that night he told me everything about his breakup. It seemed like he wanted to vent about it because I never asked for details but he offered them. 


I also feel like things are a bit more complex because we had that casual relationship 4 years ago. He didn’t give me the vibe that he wanted to hook up now. But I guess part of me feels like this is rejection part 2 lol. He didn’t want to date me then or now. 


I wanted to watch a new movie that’s coming out and have considered asking him, but I’m just not sure. I never got to asking him casually why he messaged me out of the blue, to see what his response would’ve been. I wish I could’ve told him that I didn’t hold any expectations for us now, that I’m fine just being platonic friends and just have someone to hang out with.

765,c8k8qt,EvilDarkCow,"What is the most embarrassing way you've been rejected, and what did you learn from it?","So this happened about a month and a half or so ago...

So back towards the end of April of this year (it's now early July), I went to the Chick-Fil-A up the road to grab a quick lunch. I was hungry, but in no particular hurry. It was the lunch rush so they had all their people outside running between stations taking orders and stuff (if you've ever been to their drive thru during a rush, you know exactly what I mean). Anyway, I happened to strike up some small talk with this girl that works there while the line wasn't moving. She seemed really cool, and I thought we really hit it off.

So started about two weeks of me going to this Chick-Fil-A at the same time every day (and my bank statement for that month certainly reflected this... RIP checking account), and every day this girl and I would chat. Could be about anything. The weather (she spent a lot of time outside so she certainly had a lot to say about that), sports, TV (I learned she's a fan of *The Office* when I came through one day sporting my Dunder Mifflin T-shirt), anything. She seemed really interesting, and I thought she was interested in me. Even when I ran out of things to talk about, she found a way to keep the conversation going until the line started moving.

Well one day I decided go inside and get my food to go (the line outside was way too long), and wouldn't you know it, she was working inside that day. So I order, sit down, and wait. And lo and behold, here she comes with my food. We spent a couple minutes just ""shooting the shit"", but I didn't try to hold her up because I knew she was really busy. Now I don't know if I was just feeling like a badass that day or what, but just as she started to walk away, I got up and tried to ask her out.

That's how I learned she's married (in a packed-tight restaurant, I may add)

She was a good sport about it, she thanked me for the offer and we both laughed it off. I ad-libbed my way out and got the hell out of Dodge. I think I did a good job of hiding it, but I was so embarrassed I actually quit going to that Chick-Fil-A for a while (now if I want my chicken sandwich fix, I go to the one by my work on the other side of town).

But wait, there's more...

I somehow wound up in the ""drive-thru lane of fate"" a couple days ago. Now keep in mind, it had been a couple months since I had been there. I order, drive around the corner, and there she is (awkward...). I was just passing through, I already paid and had my receipt. But she waved, I waved back. I had my window rolled down so we exchanged ""heys"". The line was moving so there was no time to talk. I guess I should be thankful that she doesn't seem to be bothered at all about my attempt to ask her out (or the fact that she still even recognizes me), but something about it seemed kinda awkward.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, I learned that day to always find a way to learn if someone's already in a relationship *before* you try to ask them out. And a very busy public place probably isn't the best place to learn the hard way. Don't make the same mistake I did.

&amp;#x200B;

I find this bizarre because, well, I work in a place with people of all ages. It's a very diverse age range. And yet it's always young girls who seem to like me. A few examples: A customer who happens to be a mother straight-up admitted to me that her 15-year-old daughter obsesses over me and gets depressed that she'll never be good enough (I don't even know her daughter). Some 16-year-old told her co-workers that she crushed on me and it got back to me. Another 16-year-old somehow obtained my number and confessed to me (I blocked her). Today I've had at least 5 middle-aged women tell me that they suspect this new 16-year-old has a crush on me because they keep catching her look at me and get all flustered whenever I'm around.   


These are just a few examples of many. But it's always underaged girls. I'm admittedly curious why it's never women my own age that express interest in me or ask me out. Women my own age just seem to avoid me.   


So I guess my question is: Is there a scientific explanation for this? Do teenage girls have different tastes to adult women?...",2019-07-03 14:11:11,10,0,dating_advice

I went on a third date with this guy on Saturday night. We went to a restaurant and then saw a movie. 

He asked me for a ride home but I declined (honestly because I have had bad experiences before being alone with men) for safety reasons.

Well FML on Monday morning I read on the bottom front page of the newspaper that he was mugged and stabbed while walking home.

I feel like shit and like I keep internalizing that it is my fault cause I wouldn’t give him a ride home. I was so worried about my own safety that in the end it was his safety that was compromised.

Even worse is that he texted me (now I realize from the hospital bed most likely) asking if I got home safe. I responded “yes” but didn’t say anything afterwards. Reason being that I didn’t want to seem too eager. I was planning on texting him in 2 or 3 days.

I did end up texting him on Monday night after mulling over what to do all day while literally being sick to my stomach. But he never responded.

What should I do? Should I try to visit him in the hospital? I tried to call the front desk but they wouldn’t give me a room number or even confirm he was there.

772,c8nyr5,buianhthy1412,He dumped me because of bed bugs.,"No actually its more than just that. I met a guy on tinder and was with him casually for 3 months until I told him I see him more than a friend, and some really dumb shit happen. His place had bed bugs in the recent past. I spent lot of times at his place. One time, he got bugs again, I stopped going there for more than a month. Then, we hung out at the worst state of mine, I was stressed out and depressed about lots of shit and I felt like I treated the hangout like a baggage release. I spent time with him at his place again. That night, he got bitten by a bug the first time after more than a month. So he thinks I brought bugs back from his place to his place. He is really paranoid about bugs. I took it not as serious and he was really mad. I know i sounded a bit dumb when that shit happened. I had to uber home at 2am. I sent him a sorry message. I checked everything at my apartment and no bugs are found, I checked to see if it's from me and I didn't bring bugs back. I didn't try to prove him I'd done all these shit, but ever since he never replied to my message. Never see my story on Instagram again. We've been mute for 2.5 months. I also stopped seeing his story ever since. I saw him constantly update his tinder bio, so different, like a player. I felt like after getting out of months being with me, he just wanna have mad fun. Lol. I learnt a lot from this relationship and changed as well as a person, for better. Once I slid into his tinder dm making fun of how wordy his bio. He never replies. Now, I just wanna ask how thing is with him and if he still hates me and I'll explain the bugs are not from me, I was not selfish or lied to him. I don't expect anything from him I just feel we had great convo great chemistry and it is stupid to cut everything all off and be like stranger as of current. I was disappointed at what happened and at how he acted afterwards too but I appreciate meeting him, he got me realized lots of shit, had a lot of good memory with him in this city anyway so I wanna at least say something before leaving the city. Do you think it's worth it to reconnect with him? To be honest, I am afraid to get ignored again.",2019-07-03 13:15:51,7,1,dating_advice

774,c8nsi9,shinshila,"Need advice on how to get dates and, ultimately, a boyfriend (preferably not just minecraft one)","So long story short, I (22F) never had a bf or anything even remotely close. I tried dating apps, and after going on a few dates I realized that while there’s nothing wrong with them, these apps were not for me as I like the gradual sort of romance. World outside the internet turned out to be more complicated than an internet dweller could imagine. I was slapped by the harsh reality- there is something wrong with me, or my general dating approach, cus 8 haven’t been on a date my entire life.

So to dissect my situation:

1. I am not completely repulsive looks wise. I do get approached by one or more guys every time I go out and I have been complimented on my appearance multiple times (possibly the equivalent of ‘my mom thinks i’m pretty’). I am an average looking girl, not Miss Universe, but I do believe even average looking people can date.

2. I have a strong personality. I do have a good sense of humor and I have been told I am fun to be around and friendly (even if it took some... persuasion.... to get people to say that). I am a feisty, snarky person and to people who do not know me I may appear intimidating (which I am not). 

3. Body language wise, I am a bit awkward. I do not like making eye contact with people I do not know, which could contribute to my dateless, loveless, sad existence. 

TL;DR: I need advice on how to get dates FOR A GIRL and how to generally be more approachable and attractive. Keep in mind that I may actually be a self unaware abomination. Reddit boyfriend queries are accepted.",2019-07-03 12:59:12,20,1,dating_advice

Before this I had been dating a little bit but was content being single. We hit it off instantly and had a very passionate and intense relationship. About 3 months in we started getting more serious, he called me love, told me he wanted his parents to meet me, introduced me to friends, etc. We talked every day and talked about many personal things. 
He ended up ending things after 6 months and I was devastated. 
A part of me felt suspicious though and it turns out he was cheating on me. I’m pretty sure he’s now dating that other girl. 

It’s been a few months and I’ve gotten back on bumble and gone on a few dates. About a month ago I went out with a guy and had a great time. I thought he was cute, funny, smart and that I could be myself around him. We both work and travel so we aren’t always texting and had some gaps in our plans, occasionally we send each other things on insta. We have now been out 4 times with each other and we always have a good time. We ended up hooking up the last time we hung out (like 2 days ago). I have a feeling we’ll hang out the week after July 4th. I’m now at this point of feeling good about this guy and my anxiety has gone through the roof. 

I feel like this past relationship really fucked up my normal meter. How often should I text this guy? I don’t want to be annoying, and idk what I’d even say if we texted every day like the last guy. 
How do I continue the great momentum I’ve felt with this new guy in a healthy sustainable way?  what is even normal!? 

And also how do I quiet the anxiety inducing fear I have of being cheated on again? How do I know I’m not the other woman now? Or what if this does work out, only to have the relationship end right after I develop feelings, and end up heartbroken again? 

Does anyone have any tips on dating again after a cheating situation? And how do you not let the anxiety and out of whack feelings you have get in the way of just relaxing and having a good time with a new person?",2019-07-03 04:50:32,2,3,dating_advice

Long story short my boyfriend has changed and is now a daily weed smoker. Paired with his symptoms of depression, I feared a serious abuse problem. 

We talked today. He says he’s not depressed and that it’s not a problem, he does it because he wants to.

Now I have to decide what to do next. I don’t see myself long term with a daily smoker, and while I love him, I don’t want to waste his time. We can aim for a compromise but it’s time for a serious discussion. 

I just need words of support right now, I don’t want to break up but if being a stoner is what he envisions for himself, I can’t do it.

So I was lonely last week and downloaded Tinder. I matched with this guy (M35) from Ireland and we texted all day for a few days (initiated by him) and he was really into me. He said he is looking for a relationship and I said I’m not sure if I’m looking for one but I’m open to it if things go well with someone. I told him I haven’t really been dating since my mom passed last year and today was exactly one year from when she passed. We opened up about a few heavy things that have happened in our lives. He confided in me that he left Ireland after finding his brother who committed suicide. 

We went out Saturday night and we had a fabulous time and the chemistry was on fire. We couldn’t stop touching each other in little ways.,When he left, we said we wanted to see each other again but didn’t make plans. We chatted all day Sunday beginning with a good morning text from him. My birthday was yesterday and he wished me Happy Birthday first thing in the morning and asked again if I had plans. I’ve really started to value my alone time, perhaps too much, and I told him I was going to go to my favorite spot in the woods alone and swim and meditate and do my thing. He has his 5 year old daughter until Wednesday so I’m pretty sure he wasn’t asking me to hang out with him. 

When I got back from the woods I was super emotional about my mom and feeling very alone and a bit anxious. I started to worry we hadn’t made plans to see each other again and I asked him if he wanted to go to a 4th of July party with me. He said he would like to but he already committed to swimming at his friend’s house. A little while later, I told him I was having a hard time dealing with my mom’s passing. He was super empathetic and invited me over if I needed company. I politely declined telling him I’m an ugly cryer. He checked in about an hour later asking how I was doing and after telling him I was just getting it all out ugly crying he said good and I didn’t hear from him again, including this morning. So around noon I was feeling really embarrassed and sent him a text apologizing for being emotional last night. He said I have no reason to apologize, he understands and it’s only been a year so it’s still fresh. He told me to chill today and do what I need to do for me and I haven’t heard from him since. 

Is he just being nice and giving me space, or did I mess this one up too by opening up too fast. Did I come off as needy?

786,c8l66u,warmStarryNights,Please help me understand what happened,"I (27 m) messaged someone on Grindr (20 m) and we chatted for a couple of days; the usual getting to know each other. I am new at this, and i was talking to someone who lives far from me, but i was going to be traveling to their location for a vacation.

They stopped responding and after I messaged them again, they apologized. Said that they were upset about the ex and would love to meet me.

The date was great, we had great chemistry! We were laughing, sharing private information about our lives. It was the perfect balance of real talk and flirting. This person clearly had baggage from a long relationship so I was careful not to push them too much and made it clear that we can take things as slow as they'd like. They also mentioned a possessive mother more than a few times. I sensed it was probably all true but also a crunch for them to bail out of plans. This is also common for men in this country and I figured they have some issues but nothing crazy.

It's taboo for men to kiss in public in this country but they gave me a peck on the neck before putting me in a cab. We had a couple of more phone calls and agreed that we'd like to see each other. During these calls this person needed prodding to share their full name but they did. A few messages were exchanged, some of them (from them) were tastefully sexual too.

I moved my itinerary around to make time for this second date. I told them that i'd have a hotel room so we could just hold hands without them worrying about people staring. I also made is clear a few times that it doesn't mean we have to get into bed and that it's just so they'd feel comfortable in some privacy.

I confirmed plans 2 nights ahead. We were supposed to meet at a restaurant they'd pick but the afternoon came and no response. I sent a couple of texts to ask if we were still on, since they hadn't picked the restaurant yet. Silence. The whole time i could see them active on grindr. So i shot them a message in grindr (this person is always more responsive on gridr and suggested i should message there). I asked what's going on and they said they have some people over at home. I asked if they'd like to do something later that day and they said ""can't say"". 

My head was buzzing, and i didn't want to keep looking at their grindr profile, so i blocked them. We still had numbers exchanged. Maybe this was my mistake ? I later unblocked them the same day and asked what's going on. In response they asked if I had blocked them, I explained why and then they blocked me. Now i know that probably pissed them off, but i am taken aback by how easy it was for them to just stop talking. Then they blocked my number too giving me no opportunity to apologize or explain. 

Reddit, I know I should'nt have blocked them on grindr but i never intended for it to be end of conversation. We had been talking over texts and calls frequently. I just wanted to stop looking at their profile and overreact. Does anyone have insight on what's going on here?",2019-07-03 07:32:31,4,2,dating_advice
787,c8k39r,OnHiatus11,Lovesick over an old friend I recently got together with that’s been distant. Not sure what to do about this,"*Moderately long post - apologies in advance*
Some backstory: we’ve been friends  around three years now. We met when our band got together and I’ve  (22F) had feelings for him (23M) since then. We both had a serious significant other during that time so nothing came of anything. 

We would rehearse every weekend at his place (home studio), where his girlfriend also lived with him. Found out they weren’t engaged but serious enough to consider it. 

I went through a very rough time back then and the entire band knew about it. He’s comforted me before, but we’ve never really sat down and talked us. 

Recently joined Tinder since my breakup a couple months ago out of curiosity/loneliness. His face was the first to pop up. I dared myself and swiped, not thinking anything would come of it. 

5 hours later and he’s matched with me.

We talk casually, eventually share breakup notes, back and forth kinda stuff. After a couple of hours he brings up my anxiety attacks (fun times during band rehearsal) and asks if I’m doing better. Then says he’s always wanted to be there for me, even if he couldn’t, regardless of “whether [I] was ever attracted to him”. I say something like “I’ve always been attracted to you”. 

We make plans to get together. 

I go over that night &amp; we walk to grab a bottle of wine/start up a movie. An hour of tension later, I move to lean against him and put my feet up. He cradles my face and kisses me. Says “you have no idea how long I’ve wanted to do that”. 

I end up staying the night over. At one point we’re laughing about Tinder dates and agree we are both hopeless romantics on the wrong dating app. He laughs and says “I’m guessing at some point we’ll become infatuated with each other”. 

&gt; Sorry for the strange dialogue cuts, just want to provide an idea for the tone we’ve set. &lt;

I get a little awkward leaving that morning but he’s sweet &amp; makes me a coffee/offers an Uber. To be blunt, I’ve had and have feelings for him, but we haven’t talked much since then. 

I went over again a week later to pickup something I’d left that night, and it was awkward but smiles all around. Tells me he’ll be out of town this weekend. 

As I’m leaving he says “don’t be a stranger”.. I’m stumped. I get why he wouldn’t want to jump into anything serious, but I got the impression that he likes me too. I’m not sure how to proceed at this point. I’m serious about him, but I’m happy to take things slow and just see each other. 

I am kinda socially awkward, but ONLY around very confident/shit-together people. He is one of them. Not sure how to initiate anything at this point but I want to try. 

Thanks for reading/skimming friends

788,c8j88d,savingbeez,How do I get over my fears that have to do with relationships?,"In need of some good advice here. I’ve come to realize that the reason why I’m so easily able to “let people go” and not care is because I don’t let myself get so attached in the first place. Of course there’s some exceptions (long-term friends, family) but other than that I feel disconnected. I often don’t let others, even friends, know too much about me- and it’s unintentional. It just happens. There’s some friends that I’ve known for years who don’t actually /know/ me, if you get what I’m saying. I feel like this really affects my ability to connect with others deeper than a surface level, and has affected my dating life for a while now. 


I think this may be due to the fact that I’m afraid of letting others have the power to hurt me/leave me, especially once I open up to them. When confronted with potential relationships, I begin to panic and get flighty, which almost always causes the guy to give up (totally my fault, I know).

We’ve been talking for about two weeks and have since been on two dates (one of which is tonight’s one I’m concerned about). We weren’t super hot and heavy to start with, which I appreciated because I wanted to let myself naturally grow feelings for him over time especially since I’m still seeing two other people. 

He’s definitely now the one I like the most of them though. Over the weekend I went away to the mountains with my girls, and he was texting me pretty much the whole time asking how the trip is (but not excessively - once in the morning and once in the evening, with a little conversation after each), and was definitely a little flirty as well (saying I look stunning in response to a snap I sent him in my going-out attire, saying I still look cute even with smeared makeup that I ruined from laughing so hard that I started crying, etc). On the car ride back I texted him saying I’m bored and he started iMessage games and talked to me about literally whatever for a whole hour of the drive. We also at some point set up a date to go bowling today, which was the first free day I had after coming back from the trip. 

Today, I was still tired and very sore from a long hike we did in the mountains (not visibly), but I still really wanted to see him. He payed for everything, he said he wanted it to be his treat because I’m unemployed and don’t begin my internship until August. 

During the date, I realized I definitely was not as good as bowling as I thought and at the same time he underestimated his ability (nearly EVERY THROW he did was a strike) and I tried laughing it off at first, but I couldn’t help but feel embarrassed &amp; combined with my fatigue it definitely dampened my mood. He took notice and was making lots of jokes (which I appreciated), and even started offering me pointers when I kept getting gutter shots. He was also touchy but in an ambiguous sort of way (nothing clearly flirty, but rather making lots of excuses to touch me otherwise, like back pats of encouragement, sitting close to me on the bench, fist bumping after my gutter shots, etc). I feel so bad because I did appreciate this but I just feel like my embarrassment took over. It didn’t get better when we started playing pool and I also lost both rounds (though I was a lot better at pool than bowling and he admitted he played a lot with his friends &amp; that I would be great with practice). We only stayed an hour and a half because he has to work the next morning, and the date ended in a hug but no kiss. 

I’m concerned by the lack of kiss and I’m worried that my embarrassment and tiredness ruined it. I realize the bowling shouldn’t have bothered me so much, but with him being so amazing at it (even though he claimed to suck) I couldn’t help but feel a little useless lol. I texted him as soon as I got in my car apologizing if I appeared aloof because I’m still so tired from the trip and was also a little ashamed of my bowling skills. He texted back saying not to worry, he understands I might have been a little drained still, and that he had fun too. He didn’t mention a third date right there (on our first date he said right at the end he wants to see me again) and I’m also worried about that but perhaps now he thinks the ball is in my court since he initiated the second date. 

What do you guys think? Is the interest gone? To me it just felt a little too “friend-zone”ish for my liking, even though I hate that word. Clearly he’s interested based on the types of texts he was sending me over the weekend but I didn’t really get that same chemistry in person. I’m wondering if maybe we’re both just shy. 

TL;DR - went on a second date with a guy I’m starting to really like &amp; had been texting throughout a whole weekend trip and during the date I feel like I was acting tired &amp; was too anxious over looking stupid playing bowling and pool.

I also disagreed with some of his comments. (Hence my mind's saying no to a second date.)

796,c8az8f,Hazkinz,This advice I read about asking someone out &amp; rejection helped me be more comfortable with asking people out.,"I have been on a journey trying to improve my mental health and my dating life (more so my self confidence). I am currently reading a book by Dr. Robert Glover (author of No More Mr. Nice Guy...great book by the way). Anyways his newest book ""Dating Essentials for Men"" was recently published and there was a part of his book that resonated with me. I thought I would share what he wrote and I hope this could help others. I am paraphrasing it a bit because I feel like this can be for men &amp; women.

&amp;#x200B;

\* When you ask someone out and they tell you ""no"", they are only saying ""no"" towards dating, to sex, or to a romantic relationship. They aren't saying no to you (in regards to your worth and value as a person). No person has the power to ""reject"" them (i.e., to determine their value as a human being). Just because 1 person has low interest in you, doesn't mean everyone feels the same.",2019-07-02 16:00:46,13,32,dating_advice
797,c8mfou,samsamattack,I [28 F] have a no definition relationship with my bf [25 M] but he suggested that we are dating..,"Yesterday he called, drunk and we talked about my day and he said ""the taste of beer remind me of you"" i smiled, it's cute and we are doing good together and we communicate. Then he followed it up with ""idk if we broke up what will i do? I will hate beer if you leave me"" and i swallowed hard and joked about also hating where we usually hangout and drink and all the bars we go together.

Thing is, two weeks ago on our 5th date i was half drunk and i told him the truth. I told him i'm not over my ex and that i don't want anything serious and that we are two people enjoying our time together. He used to hate to hold hands, but once i assured him that i dont want a boyfriend he was actually relieved and he would hold hands and act like we were a couple sans the actual weight of being a real couple with all the package that tag along a real relationship.

And i loved this undefined relationship, but yesterday's call suggested that we are a couple and that if we broke up he will be hurt and hate beer and i trust him when hes drunk more than i do when hes sober and it scared me, it made me now feel the pressure that we are a real couple and that with time, we may love each other.

He is a great guy, but we were clear and happy about being casual together, why now break that deal? It will mess things up between us!",2019-07-03 10:24:51,2,1,dating_advice

799,c8ojel,PurpleMommy,Dumped a guy over his Instagram use,"  Long story short I really liked this guy, he treated me nice, has a good job , his own house, and a single parent like me. Well I haven’t been in a relationship in two years since my abusive cheating ex. I used to go through my exes phone and it became obsessive and toxic.


  So cue to this guy things are going well, but then I notice his Instagram activity. He would be constantly adding and liking girls pictures and more than 80% of his followers were women. 

  Him and I had a couple open conversations about it and he said he would stop liking pictures if I didn’t like it..... so I kept on looking maybe he stopped liking pictures but he kept adding the girls and my girlfriend pointed out that if a girl is on private we can’t see the likes. 

  So two days I broke it off with him but he still called me and texted me and I thought maybe he’s willing to change his ways. Well he added two girls and that was the last straw for me I told him last night I didn’t want to see him anymore. The whole reason I’m asking for advice is someone who hasn’t been in the dating game for almost 5 years and now social media has an even bigger presence. 

  I’m not really sure how to navigate around that but I do know that I did not like it. I also started therapy to work on my own insecurities. Any advice for single mom who has to set a good example for her daughter?

800,c8ki0q,freebird348,Should I invite her to a 4th of July Party?,"Here’s the deal:

It’s 11pm right now on July 2nd. My friends and I organized a small 4th of July party and just sent out the invites (about 25 people).


So there is this girl at work that I’m into. Due to my work environment, I don’t see her at work often since we’re at client site but I’ve gotten to know her a little better recently. I just added her on Facebook a few days ago and she accepted and messaged me “omg you know ___ and ___! Small world” (since we had some mutual friends). Obviously a good sign that she went out of her way to message me. 

I do plan on asking her our soon, I’m just waiting for the best time. I don’t want to ask her out through Facebook chat but I don’t know how often I’ll see her in person. 

Now I could invite her to this party, but it’s very late notice. Here is my concern: if I ask her to do something I want to make sure she has the chance to actually decide if she wants to go or not — then it will be easier for me to know if she likes me. For example, if I ask her to come to a party in 2 weeks when I know she will be in town, then if she says no I will know she isn’t interested (unless she has a really good excuse). It’s more than likely that she has plans for 4th of July at this point, so if she says no it could still mean she’s interested. However, I don’t want to have to ask her to do something again after she says no cause then there is the risk of being too pushy and she may change her mind on her interest.

To put it simply, I want to optimize my chances of spending the outside of work with her.",2019-07-03 06:07:42,8,2,dating_advice

We hung out in group settings a few times, had a lot in common, and I really enjoyed getting to know her.  She was also stunningly beautiful: if I had a “type” it would be “mild Suicide Girl:”  alternative vibe, tattoos, piercings, short hair, slender, etc.  She was all of that and more, but I had just ended a rough relationship and she was moving for her job a state away.  So, we remained Facebook friends, talked occasionally over the intervening time. 

Two months ago, she found out she was transferring to about 45 minutes away from me.    Our talking got increasingly intense, we realized we were both interested in giving things a try.  Old story:  we started off cautiously, “taking it slow,” but within a couple weeks we were both all in.

This past weekend we were able to meet up for the first time...and she’s gained significant weight.  She looks much different, to the point I felt little attraction.  She’s wonderful, love talking to her, and if there’s a chance I want it to work.  She’d previously told me she’d “put on about 10 pounds” and was planning to get back in shape.  But I don’t know.  


Do I try to stick with it, even though the physical chemistry isn’t there, hoping she really is serious about getting back in shape?  Who knows how long it will take?  And is that really fair to either of us?  What if nothing changes, and I’ve just led her on and caused her more pain.


Yeah, I feel shallow.  But in my experience there has to be physical attraction, or it ends miserably for both parties.  But, if you’re chomping at the bit to call me a jerk, I understand, and half agree.",2019-07-03 02:12:05,10,4,dating_advice

804,c8keu6,throwawaythefrog,"Girl invited me to her birthday party with those weird words ""ahh, it's so nice to have a new friend around at my birthday""","gotta tell you the backstory I guess

Let's call her Lucy

So we are both girls, 17 y/o. We've known each other for a few years just because we were hanging out with some mutual friends of ours, so we never really talked, but I always had thoughts like *""oh she cute k""*. But a week ago Lucy texted me like *""been clearing my friends list so I wanted to know if you would text me back""*. I was kinda happy to get a text from her, started a dialogue about how tricky it is to get to know a person in a big group of friends. So at the end I invited her to go with me to a music festival and she said yes. It was a great evening, I think, we had some nice silent dreamy moments, holding hands, a couple of *""the looks""*. but the chemistry seemed kinda off and I still wasn't sure that she knew I wanted this to be a date. 

The next day we had a little chat about the festival, she said that she had a great time too 

Two days after the festival I asked Lucy to go to the cinema together (""Princess Mononoke"" remastered version, ikr). She said yes and even seemed pretty excited about it. When we met she said that it's been a while since someone asked her first. I paid for the tickets. We watched the movie and then Lucy said that she knows a nice fancy pizza place nearby. We had a nice talk there. I would say we had pretty much the same level of chemistry, but with a bit more confidence (I would say we are both kinda shy). And she said ""I think you are really pretty girl and that's a compliment"" (I thought I'm gonna pass out cause no one, even my ex gfs, has ever called me pretty, you know). Oh, and she paid for the pizza.

And after all of that Lucy invited me to her birthday party this Saturday. I was reeeally excited to hear that but then she was like ""I know right? I'm so glad I have a new friend coming to my birthday, thank you!""

So I'm wondering – I've been daydreaming all this time about us starting to become a thing, or it's just alright and she calls me a friend in this context of her b-day party?

806,c8j6y9,h1fr1ends,Person I'm dating has gone completely cold -- what's the best next step?,"I (M27) have been seeing a new girl over the last few weeks (F26). 
I've been dating on and off for the last 3 years since my last relationship and haven't met or found anyone worthwhile... until now. I met this girl a few weeks ago and we hit things off instantly. We have a ton of things in common -- our personalities, values, and interests are very aligned and we've been incredibly open and communicative with each other thus far. The physical attraction is there as well.

Everything has been very positive -- she was open about starting to develop feelings for me and I reciprocated. I don't typically get vulnerable this early on but it felt okay to do because everything felt so comfortable.

This last weekend we hung out quite a bit -- Thursday, Friday night (over night), and Sunday during the day. Hookups were great as far as I could tell. She had been talking about a possible party for the 4th at her place that I could come to. 

Sunday we met up in a park and hung out, and eventually ended up getting dinner together. That's when things got weird. She mentioned she typically doesn't hang out with someone this much this early on and that she'll likely need some space this week, but that she could still maybe see me Thursday or Friday.  At the end of the date, she mentioned that the conversation felt ""washed"" and ""meta"" and it was making her feel self-conscious -- not exactly sure what that means or what I said. We went our separate ways and I waited a couple hours, texted her later in the night saying I had fun this weekend and to have a great week. She responded quickly and said the same.

Since then it's been completely dark. I tried to give her space, so I waited another day and lightly texted about a concert she might be interested in -- no reply (it's been almost 2 days now). There's typically also been some side interaction over Instagram -- she hasn't interacted or messaged me at all since Sunday.

What did I do wrong here and what's the best next step ? I really like this girl and don't want to ruin this. Did I get vulnerable too quickly? 

If I don't hear from her tomorrow, should I call her? Should I text her asking how her week was? 

tl;dr: Had a great few weeks with someone, then they went completely cold.

I'm at a loss. Any help would be appreciated!",2019-07-03 03:39:43,8,3,dating_advice

Am i in the wrong?","I (22F) was fwb with a John (19M) for about 10 months. During this time we pretty much acted as a couple (we’ve both acknowledged and agreed on this). About 4 months into the fwb I told John I had feelings for him but he told me “it just wasn’t there” for him and that he was in love with another one of his friends but she had a boyfriend so he couldn’t pursue her. We continued to hook up (never sex, he’s a virgin). I also continued to hangout with other people because I obviously needed to move on from John. So I met up with a guy from tinder a few times and ultimately ended up having sex with him. When I told John about this he got really mad at me, basically saying he didn’t know me like he thought he did if I was the kind of girl who could fuck a random guy who didn’t even care about me. I got upset with him for talking to me that way and we didn’t talk for a few days. When I reached out to him and tried to fix it he would put very little effort into fixing the friendship and say since it was my issue it was my responsibility “to fix it.” During this time he also avoided hanging out with me, making up bs excuses. I tried to explain to him that it was a two-sided problem and we had to meet in the middle to fix it but he wouldn’t agree. At this point I wanted to end things but ultimately stuck around because he had a death in his family and I was his main support system emotionally. I found out later that the reason he was avoiding me was because he had started to hangout with another girl (which didn’t work out). He would text me when he was drunk about her even tho he knew I had feelings and it hurt me. He also began to go from providing consistent emotional support to me to pretty much just giving up. This obviously stressed me out but I was so in my feels I didn’t care. About a month later (April) I met another guy (25M) and started to date him shortly after. For about a month I dated this guy but I ended it when John told me he thought he might have feelings for me and I realized I still had unresolved feelings for him. Once I ended things with the other guy, I came to John and told him I had feelings too but John told me he still wasn’t sure about his feelings or if he really wanted to date. We continue to hook up but I ended up getting frustrated that he wouldn’t tell me an answer. When I finally told at him in a phone call that I. was in love with him, he came back and said he wanted to date. I told him no because I didn’t like being pulled around and hurt like he had hurt me on multiple occasions. Overall, it was too little too late as I had begun to lose feelings for John. During this time, I also began to develop more feelings for the guy I had dated for a month (Sam). I ultimately decided that while both these guys wanted to date me that I needed to take a step back from John because the relationship was getting very toxic and he wouldn’t listen to anything I said. He fought me very hard on giving me space (for 3 weeks) and I had to block him on all forms of social media because he just wasn’t taking no for an answer. This was 3 weeks ago. Throughout this whole thing he consistently played the victim card and rarely took blame for anything. He even admitted in a fight that he believed I’m often wrong and he’s right. I unblocked him on social media in the last few days as he can’t view my accounts anyways. He somehow managed to be able to message to me on Instagram without a message request. He sent me a long message playing the victim card again saying that I stabbed him in the back and he can’t believe I’ve been treating him the way I have. He wants me to message him back so that he knows he can move on. I feel like I’ve tried to make it super clear in the past  I don’t want to date him and that I’m trying to date Sam (which is a whole other complicated mess) but he repeatedly wouldn’t take no for an answer. My question is am I in the wrong here? Should I have handled the situation in a different way? And should I message him back? And if I do, what do I even say? 

tldr; fwb is in love with me, I was in love with him but I’m not anymore and when I told him no to dating he wouldn’t listen so I blocked him and now he’s messaging me asking to talk to me again and playing the victim card. What do I do? Was I in the wrong?",2019-07-03 03:32:33,5,3,dating_advice

812,c8ha4i,Obi-Swan,My college experience with girls,"This is a long read about my relationship experience during my time in college and how it has helped me grow into a more confident individual. I hope it can help some of you guys.

During my second year in the Accounting program at my university, I met this girl in one of my classes - let’s call her J.  She was the nicest person that I’ve ever met and I pretty much instantly fell for her. At the time, I was extremely shy and had very low self-esteem, and I was always extra awkward around her, but she constantly made an attempt to have a conversation with me. We became good friends and were study buddies that semester. I wanted to let her know how I felt, but I was too scared to tell her in person, so at the end of the semester I confessed through text. She rejected me and told me that if it was too awkward to stay friends that she would understand.  I was extremely naive at the time and said it was okay if we were just friends. We actually got even closer that summer, and was practically texting every day, even going into details about our private lives.  I grew extremely attached to her. 

Things went south very quickly once the next semester started. I could tell that she was starting to put some distance between us. She would take much longer than usual to respond to my messages and often just left one word responses. I didn’t know how to handle it. I got very angry and started to ignore her. I could tell that this bothered her because she would make an attempt to try to talk to me more when I was trying to push her away. But then whenever I did start trying to talk to her again, she would start distancing herself again. This back-and-forth happened constantly throughout the semester, until eventually, I felt as though I was just being used and cut her off completely. Once I did, she started to post a lot of depressing posts on her social media and it really fucked me up.  I became extremely depressed and thought about committing suicide almost every day.

Eventually I met another girl from the Accounting Club - we’ll call her V. I initially didn’t have feelings for her, but became very comfortable talking to her as she was a very good listener. We also had a lot in common - we were both shy and introverted and kinda had similar relationship issues and values. I slowly grew fond of V and she also helped me slowly lose feelings for J.  My mind was still extremely fucked up from the past experience so I held back from letting her know how I felt. I was actually pretty happy with our relationship, until one day when I heard that V was starting to talk to someone else. Almost instantly, it felt like all the growing depression from my past experience hit me at once - I actually felt more depressed than I’ve ever felt previously. I wasn’t paying attention in class and would immediately go home and just stare at the ceiling until I fell asleep. I knew I had to do something about this, so one day I worked up the courage to confess to V in person. I took her somewhere where we could talk alone and it was as if I was just vomitting all my emotions - it wasn’t pretty, but I did end up confessing. Of course, she told me that she was talking to someone else, which I knew, but it was just a huge relief for me to get it out of my chest. I explained to her that I just needed to get it out but that I was afraid it would tarnish our friendship. She ensured me that nothing was going to change, and I was once again too naive and believed her. 

Whenever I saw V at school, I would make every attempt to treat her normally, but I could tell that she was starting to treat me differently. She would pretend like she doesn’t see me walking past her in the hall and whenever I said hi, it felt like it was a hassle for her to come talk to me. 

Eventually I texted her, letting her know that if things are too weird between us, that I would have no problem putting some distance between us. She insisted that everything was okay, so I just kept talking to her when I saw her. Of course, everything was not okay and it seemed like she was making any attempt to avoid me. I confronted her again about it, but was more direct this time, asking her why she has been acting so weird around me. She told me that I was being paranoid and that if things did seem different, it was because she’s been too busy with studying and whatnot. At that time, I told her that I needed to distance myself from her and she told me that if that’s what I wanted that she would respect it. Of course, she didn’t actually respect it as about a week later, when she saw me studying, she came and tried to approach me. (I think at this time, she stopped talking to the other guy), but it really pissed me off that she wasn’t actually respecting my space, so I got up and left without saying anything to her. I could tell that this affected her because she was very noticeably avoiding me at this point.

Eventually I said screw it and went and talked to her, pretending like nothing happened, and finally for a while it seemed like we were friends again. But it was short-lived as when I started to talk to other girls, it seemed like our friendship would get worse. Friends of mine that she didn’t even really like to talk to, it seemed like she was making an attempt to be super buddy buddy with. This really messed me up because of the fact that she was going out of her way to be friends with everyone around us except for me. 

Once we graduated, I tried sending her a text and she completely just ignored it. This was pretty much the final straw for me, and so I deleted her off of all my social media and just went on my way. But, that very same day, she texts me something along the lines of “haha sorry, I think I accidentally unfollowed you, better follow me back!” I ignored her, and then she tried sending another message which I also ignored. I knew this affected her though, because afterwards her older sister unfollowed me as well, even though her and I were cool. So eventually I texted V, trying to make amends by inviting her over to my new place for a little house warming party and of course she ignored me. So I sent her one last text, apologizing for hurting her in any way and explaining why I deleted her and also that I won’t be contacting her again. She finally messages basically just saying goodbye. 

My experiences with these two individuals were pretty terrible, and I mostly blame myself for all the negative outcomes. There is a silver lining to my experience - I now have a much better understanding of myself and what I want in life. I’m also much more experienced with relationships and know how to properly convey my emotions to the people I care about. I’ve also realized that I’m a lot more confident when it comes to talking to girls, and just overall more confident in general because I’m not afraid of rejection. It made me realize that, just because you have a terrible experience with someone, it doesn’t mean that you can’t learn and grow from it. I’m ultimately glad that I’ve met these two people, and if either were to initiate a conversation with me today, I would have no problem rekindling our friendship.

814,c8hw39,phiemon,Am I(F25) expecting too much from him(M28)?,"Hello redditors!
I’m a bit confused with my situation right now and if any of you have any experiences or opinions to share on this topic, I’ll be extremely grateful!
I’m dating this guy (for 7 months now) and we’re doing really well togheter and decided to date seriously and be exclusive. 
He spends most his time at my place and eat every meal here when he’s here, and doesn’t really pay much. He drinks up my more expensive milk for lactose intolerance (which I am, and he’s not) also uses my shampoo and conditioner which is not needed for his hair at all. I tought I could ask him if he could but his own to have at my place, but he doesn’t. 
Overrall when we go shopping too I end up paying for most of it even though we know he’s gonna eat more than half of it...

He never wants to take me out or buy me anything, even though I’ve got him so much. He hasn’t even given me a birthday present, which is like a month ago... I feel so disappointed and have asked him about it, then he said he struggled to find something so I told him no rush.... but this on top of the whole not paying anything he eats when he’s here... feels like a lot

I’m used to the guys I’ve been dating to want treat me to dinner or movies, and atleast get their own soap and some of the food they eat at my house.
Right now I’m paying for 85% of every meal if not more, and I’m a struggling student with 1200$ a month, when he’s working and earns at least 2600$

But maybe I’m asking too much from someone this early in the relationship. 
Or maybe I should tell him about how I feel, but how?

Thank you so much guys!


TL;DR: He (working) never pays for the food we cook or anything else when he’s at my place, 5 days a week. Haven’t gotten bday present or anything sweet in general, is he just really cheap or aren’t I worth spending money on?",2019-07-03 01:25:54,7,5,dating_advice
815,c8lmd7,voldemort996,Good friend going on a date with girl I made out and went on a date with.,"This is a first for me and I find it weird. Long story short, I went on a date with this girl who is very touchy and showed interest. Even if we would be with a group at clubs, she is very cuddly/touchy. And now, she’s out going on a date with a good friend of mine that she met on Tinder. How do I know? She sends me a snap of him like it’s nothing. She is well aware that I am good friends with the guy. Now, that friend (the guy) has no clue that I have gone on a date with her but only knows that I’ve hung out with her with a group of friends. 
This girl has kissed me without me even trying (which tells me that she was interested). 

EDIT: its kind of a “love triangle” involving two friends. NO STRANGERS

817,c8lfqy,ProjectEcstasy,How I Went From Being Socially Awkward to Cultivating a Spectacular Social Life,"As a child, we would move a lot. I moved countries twice, and in each of them moved houses and schools about 2 - 3 times. It was rough. I would make a friend or two, and then we'd have to move. It was really hard for me to build good relationships and it wasn't a pleasant experience. It taught me how to not get attached and not need anyone, since I realized I was the only ""Constant"" in my life, and everyone else is a ""Variable"", but other than that....NOTHING. I moved back to my home country 2 years ago....No friends, no social circle. I just had some family members I hung out with.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been awkward in Social Settings. I'd get nervous, stutter, not know what to say, and a million other things. It **SUCKED.** I wanted to change. I wanted to make some friends, become social, discover what it's like to be active and go out having fun with no worry on my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had no one, so I had to do it all on my own. I would go out and try to talk to strangers, but I could NEVER get myself to do it. I would feel chemicals run through my veins, my heart pounding at the speed of light, and I'd freeze up. ""HOW the HELL am I supposed to get over this?"" I thought to myself. So, I started researching, learning, and applying. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was so freaking hard, it felt impossible. I would learn a lot of new stuff, but when I try to talk to people I'd freeze up again. It GOT **FRUSTRATING**. I wanted it to end. I began trying different methods, and after a month of going out, I was Finally able to smile at a stranger and Say ""Hi, How's Your Day?"" she replied ""Good, what about yours?"" and that was it. It was **LITERALLY so scary,** but after 2 seconds, it was the BEST Feeling in the world. I. GOT. HOOKED. 

&amp;#x200B;

After this happened, I started going out daily. Challenging myself, pushing my limits. I would stay home for hours learning all the correct things to say, how to say them, how to stand, how to sit, how to act, etc. I wanted to become the God of Social Skills.

Fast forward a couple months, I could approach anyone and start a conversation. We would talk, have a good time, and then I'd bounce. Sometimes I took their numbers, Insta, etc. and others I didn't. Everything was going great, but it felt like I didn't build deep connections with people. YES, I was having fun, but more often that not, It wouldn't lead to anything promising. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I started learning how to build deep, lasting connections with people, and it WORKED. After a month of refining the methods I learned, I could build deep connections in minutes, epic isn't it? I felt like I'm on top of the world, and I started learning more about how humans interact and all about Social Dynamics. How people pick the leaders, why we're attracted to certain types of people, ancient psychology, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

It has been almost 2 years since I began my journey. Right now, I meditate, developed amazing habits, I go to the gym 6 days a week, and most importantly I cultivated a Spectacular Social Life. I am so proud of myself.

This experience has truly changed my life and since then I've been working to change people's lives too. I have become a Social Skills Mentor and have helped a couple of people get their desired goals Socially. It is truly **fulfilling...helping others.** I am so grateful that I am able to help people live their best lives and that my experiences shaped me to become the person I am today.

If you are going through anything in life, just know, you got this. It honestly felt impossible to me at first, but here I am. Long story short, do not give up on your dreams not matter what. It is cliche, but trust me. If you have a dream, dedicate your LIFE to it. - Project Ecstasy

Anyway, yesterday and today we went to this Vietnamese grocery store and I saw a cute girl over there working as a cashier. I kind of want to talk to her since hey, I’m only gonna be here for 2 weeks so I might as well be a little risky. But I also don’t want to come off as some weirdo or creep since obviously she might not be comfortable with a random dude approaching her. Plus I don’t wanna embarrass myself in front of my family.

I found a girl(23) online. I live in England and she lives in Sweden. But since the first time we talked we are connected. It's like we know each other for ages even if it's just 2weeks now. We talk every day we text like all day long and we even do video calls. She has an amazing personality really nice and kind and honest. We both have the same idea about our future. Even the name for kids we had the same plans. It feels like we know each others thoughts. We both have some kind of feelings for the other. Even when we talk about sex we like the same things. But there always has to be a but. She is engaged. What I can see their relationship is a bit boring and comfortable. I'm not a person who wants to destroy a relationship I don't want to. But the bond what we have makes me do it. I told her we should go slowly to get to know each other before anything happens. I don't want her to break up and to ruin her life. Whatever life brings us I accept it. But she is so perfect for me. And I could be perfect for her. We could have an amazing life a wonderful partnership a great marriage. She keeps telling me how much she misses me and how I can melt her heart. And that she feels safe with me and that my voice can calm her down no matter how bad she feels. She said I'm the sweetest guy she ever know. And I feel the same about her. I just don't want to mess it up. If she is my true partner for life I don't want to lose her.

&amp;#x200B;

All I've got so far is that I want to try some kind of activity for the first meeting so I can take some of the pressure off (e.g. going to a dog park or something instead of meeting for coffee). Also not big on touch other than with a SO (not in a weird way, just that I generally try not to touch anyone unless we're dating), so I don't have any experience with that lol. I've also heard that framing it as meeting a friend for the first time is helpful and keeping in mind that we are there to meet each other rather than feeling like I need to win her over. Trying not to dig too deep into these subs as there are a lot of jaded/bitter people and that's the last thing I need.

&amp;#x200B;

Haven't dated since high school for a couple reasons, but I have no issue in social situations in general. Hopefully it won't still be a problem since it's been like eight years, or if it is I can at least own up to it lmao. I had a few long-term girlfriends in HS and the issue was getting extremely nervous about initiating new things e.g. first kiss, hand holding, etc, even though I knew they wanted it. I also vaguely remember at one point just 'having enough' of it and going for it and then it not being an issue anymore... but that was a long time ago, don't know if it will still get to me or if I'm over it for good. I know waiting somewhere for someone to show up will get my heart racing though lol.",2019-07-03 03:23:55,4,2,dating_advice

He talked about how much I mean to him, how much he likes me, how he wants a serious relationship etc. In the same breath, he says how he would want me over his future wife any day. 

I am confused. Why does he want me but he claims he has someone else.

Was it to take back the control because I ended the fling with him?  
Maybe out of insecurity? Or to make me want him? Or maybe there really is another girl, but he is talking like he still likes me so much- isnt this red flag, disrespecting the girl he is currently with?

831,c8ivmr,k-boppity,f(18) dating m(18) for about 9 months and pretty skeptical (LDR),"hello! i’m 18, almost 19, and i’ve been together with my boyfriend for about 9 months now and it’s a LDR. i was very pleased with him up until now because i feel like either it’s me falling out of love or, as he claims as, a break in the honeymoon phase. my mom claims it shouldn’t be like this during the break.

he doesn’t work because he’s pretty picky about his jobs/internships. when we go on dates, it’s not really him treating me out anymore, more like me paying a fraction of the payment like when we eat out. he used to treat me out and stuff when we first started to date, but he acts pretty nonchalant now like sometimes he forgets to kiss me hello when he comes to visit to pick me up.  i’m not one to be always like picky about paying (because i like the balance) but it’s happening so often when we visit each other that it’s kinda disappointing...idk if it’s just me?

anyway, because we are in a LDR we take turns visiting but he won’t make an exception like he used to before (ik it’s expensive to drive about 2 hours). however, he spends money on himself and his family (which is fine) but rarely on me. i surprised him for his bday and mine is coming up but he’s acting like i should be the one planning it. i plan typically almost every visit to anywhere, and it ticks me off because he acts like he’s the only busy one. like i want someone to surprise me without me having to plan it myself...

then comes my dilemma, when we get into small arguments, he goes silent on his end (pretty much informing the situation) and when we talk again, i have to pretend it never happened. i’m one to want to solve the problem by mutually understanding each other (may not be the case all the time but still). recently, because we have school, we’ve both been fairly busy...well more like i am rather than him because i work and am taking double the units for summer school, while he doesn’t work and is only taking one class which seems to be a breeze for him. we typically facetime or call, but when we do nowadays, he doesn’t want to make convo or attempt to make convo...he’s just playing his games. 

my mom says he still pretty immature because he relies on his parents for most things like laundry and food and whatnot. his family is wonderful might i say lol. but my mom is one of those moms who are very strict about education and is very judgemental. i sometimes rant to my boyfriend about how annoying she can be, and he take that and disses my mom. first of all, he doesn’t know her like i do and secondly, that’s my mom. if you insult her, you’re insulting me too, right? he should respect her regardless of her beliefs and stuff because when time comes to ask for her blessing, then what will she say?

anyway, he got into a dilemma with some friends when we started dating. it seems his solution is to shade them away because he wants to avoid drama. he’s afraid of losing people but he doesn’t seem to like put effort in keeping relationships tied together, you know? that’s how it seems this relationship feels...loose and some times disconnected. 

when we see each other, we’re really happy, but when we’re apart...we seem to lose that link between one another. i feel like it’s a hassle to drive to see him sometimes and i’m not sure why. it’s hard to say i love you even through text. it’s hard for me (as a clingy girl) to hear he’s gonna go meet with some friends and i feel like i don’t want to deal with him. yet i still gravitate toward staying with him because i feel idk...guilty? scared?

i’m honestly afraid to let go if he is supposed to be the one...yet i feel like i need to? 

i’ve been thinking if i should break up with him...? i’m really confuses, everyone...i’m sorry this is so long. i’ve tried to explain this to my friends and they said to never settle for less and i’m just scare of making a stupid decision...what do you think i should do? i’ve tried talking to him about taking a break but he sees no reason to and brushes this topic off....he also uses the guilt trip that everyone always leaves him because he’s “not enough” but he really is.

836,c8gbpm,smite2kill,Scared of not getting the chance to ask girl out,"Hi, I have a fulltime summer job at a local company, and a girl I immediately liked is working here aswell for only one week. I talked to her a few times (we are nextdoor from eachother so don't work together but are relatively nearby), and pretty much decided i want to ask her to do something besides work sometime. I will only work the same times as her for 1 1/2 day more, and pretty much the only time I can get to see her alone (1 on 1). Is when we both need to print something at the same time. I had a pretty similar situation with another girl once, and I didn't get the chance to ask her out eventually, which really sucked. I'm kind of scared the same will happen now and I'm overthinking everything... I really want to get the chance to ask her out, no matter what her answer would be. Any advice on how to deal with this? Or possible solutions?",2019-07-02 22:54:41,5,4,dating_advice

839,c8h0rg,anon182859928,Should I message him?,"Hello! This is a throwaway account and I’m on mobile. I guess I’m posting this for thoughts and advice. 

A little over a year ago I went out to a bar with friends. One friend brought her brother (M for short) “to meet me”, but I was emotionally invested in another guy (not present) and didn’t have much interest in talking to anyone else. My friend’s brother was really nice, but I was hung up on someone else. He had also just gotten out of a long term relationship and I had a feeling he needed a rebound and I’m definitely not into that. So about 9 months pass and I go to his sister’s wedding where obviously he is. We notice each other, but I’m incredibly shy and I don’t initiate anything in person. I also figured he had a girlfriend, but maybe she didn’t go to the wedding for whatever reason. A few days after the wedding I confirm he is single and I’m like okay screw it and I message him on Facebook. We talk for a few weeks and we seem to get along really well. Here’s where I screw up. December was a really bad month for me that spiraled into even worse months following, so I don’t know what triggered what I guess. First of all, anytime I get close to someone I freak out and run. I don’t know if it’s from anxiety or my past dating history. I dated someone for 4 years who cheated on me a lot, but I never left until he left me for good. Now I think everyone wants to cheat on me and I avoid getting close to people. Second of all, I am bipolar. It’s been mostly in check up until this past December when my mental health just fell apart. During December when I’m talking to M and things are going well, I start to feel off. And it just gets worse and worse. I’d been through it before and knew it was bipolar related. At the same time, I will look for any valid reason to stop a relationship from happening. So I told M I wasn’t in a place to be dating. I didn’t like it, but I didn’t want to drag him through my messed up life at the time. Things continued to get worse for me mental health wise. I managed to get in with a psychiatrist and get my meds adjusted. I resumed normal living in April. During this time I wanted to talk to M, but I figured he’d started dating again. Also I didn’t tell him about my mental health history because we weren’t at that point to bring it up. I found out last week that he is newly dating someone I work with, but he had been hoping I’d contact him. I’ve been told they are still in the “talking” phase and that he would prefer to date me. I haven’t reached out to him. I’m still interested in him, but I also don’t want to intrude on a relationship even if they just started. In my opinion I lost my chance and if it’s meant to be, it will happen when it’s supposed to. I’m also 5 months sober and I’m supposed to abstain from new relationships until I’m sober for a year. I feel terrible bringing him into my mess of a mental health life. In the past, guys have assured me they can handle my mental health but it always turns out that they can’t. I’ve been told that he still would prefer to date me. My question is - is it too late? Should I leave it alone and let it happen if it’s supposed to happen? 

TL;DR: met a guy but I ended things because of mental health. Recently found out he’s still interested in me and I’m wondering if I should contact him or not.",2019-07-02 23:59:35,2,3,dating_advice

841,c8i9wz,pandasage89,Woman says she isn't available right now.,"So a little backstory. I met a awesome woman at work. We bonded talking about her D&amp;D games. We became quick friends. I knew she was married so I didn't ask, or expect, for more. I learned she was polyamorous, and she accurately assumed I was as well, when she was talking to me about giving her number to another coworker. Later I decided to make the jump and ask her out. 

She said she hadn't thought about that and needed time to think about it and talk to her spouse. I told her to take her time. She got back to me a day later saying since her spouse was leaving for work at the end of the year they wanted to keep it just them.

We've kept our friendship going, but with less and less communication. I have started playing D&amp;D with her play group, we've kept playing, and it's not seemed weird, other than fewer talk/texts. 

Did I mess up? Do I not have a chance? Is our friendship over?",2019-07-03 02:04:48,2,2,dating_advice

Everything has been great so far and I really like him a lot and I do believe that he is interested in me too. But recently I was looking at old pictures on his instagram and saw a girl, clearly his ex, had commented on this picture (picture and comment were from a year and a half ago). Clicked her profile and notices he still follows her. He doesn't like any of her pictures but he did like one from a few weeks ago. I asked him if he still followed his ex on social media because we had conversations where he told me he hated her. He told me that she was blocked and that he doesn't have her anywhere. He clearly lied to me and I feel like I should be worried but he also has never made me feel insecure about his feelings either. I don't know what to do.

I met several girls that basically said to me that I should cut my hair and get a short haircut because they would like that more and it would fit me better. 
Recently I got this number of a girl from bumble, at first she seemed pretty interested. And on my pics you could see somewhat me having longer hair tied together. But when she asked for more pics and asked if I still have a pony tail, she instantly was put off and send me sad/disgusted/angry smileys and said that this is super unattractive and „men are not allowed to wear long hairs, men have to wear short hair“. She got extremely superficial and kinda ghosted me. And this is hitting my self esteem quite hard, because I feel like no one really is into this unique viking look nowadays, and I am thinking about getting „basic“ again with some mainstream/popular short haircut.

I felt like the way she talked and what she was looking for was something I vibed with right away. We started talking and we were both into it, she asked for my number. We chat via text and then she just vanishes. I hit her back up a month later, which I normally feel weird about but it was worth it because I thought we had potential. She agreed that we had potential and said she stopped messaging because she felt intimidated that she had nothing interesting to say and it sorta fell off. I assured her that I'm not looking for her to say something interesting all the time or whatever and let her know I'm still interested if she is. She said she is. She says that she's out of town for the week and would be willing to set up a date once she got back (she said she'd be back after the weekend which I assume is Monday) but texting would be nice in the mean time.  

  

So we texted back and forth the whole week at least once a day, sending like paragraphs back and forth. It flowed really well, like better than other people I've talked to online. I sent her a message on Saturday (we usually send each other multiple messages in sequence) and she immediately responded to the first one I sent but not the other ones. It's now Tuesday evening and there's been no message since, and I left room for her in the messages by asking questions and adding my own experiences to what she said like we were the whole time. Should I send another follow up message or is it not worth it?

858,c8finl,FrancoNore,Can someone tell me what is going on with us? (long post),"Met this girl over a year ago on a dating app. I had just moved 2 hours away but was hoping to move back in the near future. We talked a lot and got super flirty and basically established a relationship without meeting (not official, but we were both into each other and talked about super personal things). 2 months later I go out to dinner with her and we have sex in the back of my car (she lives with her parents so she couldn't bring me home). a month later she's housesitting so invites me to come stay the night, which I do and we have sex a few times. Then about 9 months go by and we were just both very busy and on different schedules that we never met up, but we still talked all day everyday without going more than a few hours without speaking. We didnt really flirt anymore because that's not our personalities, we're both sarcastic assholes to each other and most of our texts are sending memes back and forth. We fall into this routine so never bring up the ""what are we"" question. Periodically she would send me nudes so I knew there was some sort of attraction still there. Back in early may I was in town so I stopped by to see her. She told me before I came that she was not interested in having sex, and said it was an issue with her just not having any desire, and not an issue with me. I later come to find out that she thinks shes bipolar and was going through one of her down episodes where for a few weeks shes just lethargic and has no interest in anything sex related (normally she's a bit of a freak in the bedroom). So I just accept that this was the problem and it wasn't that she was over me.   


However, A few weeks ago through talking I found out she had been sleeping with someone else. She said there was no meaning behind it, just a fuck thing. Obviously she did nothing wrong since we're not dating but it still really hurt me and I knew I had to bring up our situation. I wasn't sure how long it was going on and if she was sleeping with him while she was at her low point. After some talking we both agreed that we're not ready for a serious relationship but we could take a small step forward by being exclusive, and opening up to each other more about our personal issues. I felt a lot better. We then made plans for me to go down for the weekend to spend time with her. I said I'd get a hotel room and asked if shed stay with me for the night to which she replied ""maybe if you're lucky"" (which is a normal response for her to tease me a bit). well come saturday we hang out and had a good time, we check into my hotel and have sex. Not long after the sex she gets dressed and says shes ready for me to take her back home. I ask if she wanted to stay the night and she said she couldn't because she really needed to take her makeup off and she didn't bring any overnight supplies. The car ride was quiet until I brought up the situation again. She said she misunderstood my text asking if she was going to stay the night and thought I was asking if we were going to have sex (not sure if she was being honest about this). We pull into a parking lot near her house and talk for about an hour. She gets upset and says she can't give me what I want, she still has issues from being mistreated in her previous relationship. I keep reminding her that I'm not looking for a serious relationship at the moment, just slow baby steps while we still have distance which allows us plenty of space to live our own lives. She then said that she sees me as a good friend, because she's not ready to get into a relationship. She wants to ""enjoy being single"" but is adamant that shes not talking about having sex with other people. This confused me because I'm not sure what aspects of being single she'd be missing out on aside from being able to sleep with other men. I once again tell her how I feel and ask if we can give this a go. In the end she agrees and I drop her off, kiss her goodbye and go home. Since then our texts have been normal.  


Of course coming away from this I feel even worse, I basically had to convince her to give this a shot which doesn't speak well to our chances. I'm still talking to her and not acting really different but I'm also allowing a lot more time to pass inbetween my responses. It's honestly causing me so much stress because at any moment i'm expecting that ""this isnt working out"" text. Had I only known her for a short time I might've just moved on, but this is the person I've spoken to the most for the past year, so it would be devastating to lose her but it would also hurt to stay friends and know she was out sleeping with other people. What on earth do you think is going on here from her point of view? What should I consider doing?",2019-07-02 21:45:01,10,3,dating_advice

It would piss any girl off lol. The thing is my household is run by women. My mom, older sister, me, and I have younger ones. Ive taken on a lot of responsibility from a young age and I’ve grown up faster and developed thicker skin because of it.

Nothing against men, some just seem to have an “I know best” attitude 😭 It can be something innocent like nagging me to go to bed early when I planned to stay up late for a specific reason or just trying to control me in general. I just can’t take it when it’s repetitive. Its like the equivalent of nagging to me. Or maybe I’m just not used to a dominant male voice with decision making. It’s caused major arguments in the past. I feel like I’ve survived all my life perfectly fine without a father figure, I don’t need to be policed. 

I can only be submissive in the bedroom. I like that I stand my ground but I definitely need to loosen up before thinking of marriage or I’d feel trapped. 

TL;DR: I can’t handle being told what to do by guys I date because of the way I grew up. Its not overly stupid things like screwing on the toothpaste cap. It’s more like not wanting to be controlled by a man (other than in bed lol). It does start arguments every now and then.

We've been friends for over 6 months now and I had her in the back of my mind around January and February. Another girl came along and I tried to work things out with her, but there was nothing. I've had bad mental issues the girl I asked out knows about and has had problems with too in the past, but I've been free from it for two months now. My crush on her has developed throughout these months.

So, she has said many things that don't match in the past. Once, a friend of mine told us ""I think you too are gonna end up together"" and she said ""Nah, I'm too short for him"" which made me chuckle. But it sounded as if she had feelings for me and tried hiding them.

She has shared a love poem with me, but she told me that she would title it after the person who would made her feel the way she wrote about. 

She has been extremely nice with me and, I dunno if she has noticed, but we flirted every now and then (very lightly) and I'm clearly hitting on her. 

Today, I built up my courage. I asked her, after asking her what she was planning on doing before going on vacation (which is happening in about 4 days, for almost an entire month) and she told me her plans. I noticed the day after tomorrow she was free. I told her I was too, and that ""We could hang out"". She told me ""Alright, with who else? Claudio seems..."" and I haven't responded yet. This happened about a quarter of an hour ago and she went to bed afterwards. 

I don't know what to do. I don't feel utterly bad.

866,c8d298,rfd1993,My friend is making a terrible decision. One I made before.,"First and foremost, I know that it is her decision and not mine. I know best friends are not ""yes men"" and should express concern or disagreement when required.

However, how do I tell my friend (F, 25) she's making a bad decision when I myself have done it too? Essentially, my best friend hopped out of one long term relationship into another so she has never been single between the ages of 17-25. She's currently going through the promiscuous, experimental stage many of us go through and that's perfectly fine. Her body, her choice. 

I wish that was my final say on the matter but I love her too much to let her make these choices. She is sleeping around, unprotected too, becoming infatuated in unrequited circumstances and is hurting every day because of her choices. I told her from day one, you must have similar intentions when you enter the dating world. If you just want sex, find a guy that just wants sex. If you want a relationship, find a guy that wants a relationship too, or at least can envision himself in one rather than go for guys that are still fucking around no where near ready to give up that lifestyle.

She recently met a guy through one of her other friends and it's disgraceful. The night she met him he already had a girl over at his house to have sex with. He messaged my best friend's friend (they were out clubbing), telling her to bring my best friend back to his house afterwards. Although they didn't have sex while the girl he had initially invited over was there, they did have sex after she left and later on in the day.

My friend has told me that this guy has said he ""loves how dirty"" she is and he loves her casual nature. Yet when she's told me this on the phone, she tells me she would love to get to know him more and see where it goes. I have no issue whatsoever with her sleeping around, like I said, her body not mine! However, I know that she basically lies to these guys, saying she is happy to just hook up when in reality, it's me that hears her down the phone stressed and upset that the same guy is talking to other girls etc. 

I have been in her shoes, although much more briefly. I considered attempting to make my fuckbuddy my boyfriend but he was patently uninterested (or capable) of taking our connection to another level. While it stung, I understood then you can't beg someone to love you. You can't force a relationship out of sex. 

This is more of a rant than a request for advice. I pretty much have answered my own question but I'd love to know of any  information or experiences where people have also gone through such a time in their lives and what it was that shook them out of it. 

Once again, I am in no way shaming my friend or anyone else that has casual sex. I am concerned that she presents herself as happy to be NSA but actually, tries to force these connections into actual relationships when the guys have explicitly said they only want her for sex. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - single friend lies to fuckbuddies and i don't want to hurt her by telling her she is in the wrong when they leave/lose interest/get bored",2019-07-02 18:46:43,5,5,dating_advice

A couple times when he didn’t really responded (a couple words maybe) he was chilling with his friends. My friend (who’s boyfriend is friends with him) told me that every time I told her about the situation.

872,c8c3cp,ThrowAway0516199711,Should I even be dating right now?,"I (22M) am at a loss right now. I've been in two relationships in my life. When I was 20, I had a gf for 1 1/2 years. I got back into dating 3 months after. I found a girl (21F), a really great girl who helped me finally feel better about myself, and life in general. This girl and I had a connection with each other that I couldn't believe was possible for random strangers to have. We had one date before saying we're bf and gf - we both felt it, and wanted it. A month and a bit in, we said I love you to each other and we were both on top of the world. Flash forward a few weeks... I don't feel that same connection anymore. When we said it, I just wanted to spend as much time with her as I could, as did she. Call, text, hang out, anything that we could do to spend time together. But there isn't a spark that there anymore and I can't really figure out why?  

My ex called me about a week ago. Said some final thoughts, I did the same. It was the most bitter-sweet moment I've ever had. But part of that phone call made me remember a lot of our relationship, a lot that I miss and would like to have back, but realistically speaking, won't ever happen. She was my first girlfriend, first kiss, lost my virginity to her, etc. So I'll always hold a place in my heart for her, as I think most first loves do for people. But this has made me question everything with my new girlfriend. 

My new gf doesn't drive, which is fine, but problem is she lives in a town 20 minutes away and there isn't any transit that goes from my city to her town. So if we want to see each other, I *have to be the one who goes to pick her up in order for that to happen. Part of me is thinking ""that's a lot of gas in the long run"" ""you'll always need to drive everywhere for food/errands/trips, and you don't even like to drive"" So now I'm wondering, is needing to be able to drive a deal breaker for me now so the driving aspect can be split between me and a SO? 

She also mentioned how she is going to get me to hold a snake one day, and get me to go swimming. I fucking hate snakes, and I can't swim to save my life; my biggest fear is a death by suffocation in some way (in this case, drowning). I've told her this dozens of times, but she keeps saying that she wants me to do these things with her and I don't know how I feel about this when she knows my discomfort regarding these things. 

I don't know if I should keep dating her, but really, I don't know if I'm being an asshole in dating to begin with right now? I've only had the one relationship before, and I don't know if just 3 months was enough time for me to ""move on"" from it or not? Ever since my ex called me, it's all I'm thinking about, her, not my new gf. I'm questioning everything. When she says I love you to me, I only say it because because I feel I have to, not because I want to anymore. I don't see myself wanting to text and call her much anymore. Only reason we haven't hung out for a while is because work has me on a 6 day stretch the last 2 weeks and I've been too exhausted to do anything on my days off to drive to her and see her. Part of me just wants to be alone and not date for a few months, but another part of me wants to hold on so I'm not alone. 

I know some will say ""if you go to reddit to ask, then you already know"" but I don't know... I really just want to hear what people who are far more experienced in dating have to say about this, and what their take on this is. Because I'm so lost right now and really need some advice. 

Tl;Dr:
I've only dated one girl prior, got into dating a new girl 3 months after, not sure if I've properly moved on before dating again. Need advice.",2019-07-02 17:30:15,9,3,dating_advice
873,c8f66a,DuranDuran88,Is it a terrible idea to ask this girl out?,"So there’s this girl I quite like and have done for a while now - she and I get along quite well and I’d say we’re fairly good friends. I’ve been thinking about asking her out or at the bare minimum telling her how I feel. There’s a number of ‘issues’ however which are giving me second thought and make me wonder whether it’s actually a good idea. The first of these is that we’ll actually be working together in a few months - both heading to the same firm so we’ll arguably be spending a fair few years together; you could argue that telling her how I feel could potentially make things awkward if she doesn’t feel the same way or that if we did end up going out and it doesn’t end well it may make things difficult at work (the age old saying don’t shit where you eat holds true here). Tbh I think we’re both mature enough to not let either of these things be an issue but I guess it’s definitely a factor that should be considered. On the flip side the fact that we’re both working together could be a good thing. We’ll both be working long hours (finance) and from what older friends in the profession tell me you kind of need someone who actually understands what your work life and the sacrificies it involves is like and I feel like the fact that we’ll be both doing the same thing makes it work or at least helps. Our office is so big that unless you’re assigned to the same team the chances of seeing each other during the day are somewhat slim anyway, alleviating the whole awkwardness thing if it doesn’t work out. Additionally, a lot of my female friends think the ideal situation would actually involve finding someone at work - simply because again you’re with someone who understands that your social life will be taking a bit of a hit given what you’ve signed up for (she once said the same thing a number of years back); that said, I appreciate that a lot of people want nothing to do with their jobs outside of the office and so wouldn’t want to be romantically involved with someone who reminds them of work. Issue number 2 is that she’s sort of seeing someone. From what I’ve heard from one of her close friends it’s at the initial stages* and there are some serious red flags emerging from this guy; apparently says a lot of weird things which at best are ‘douchey’ and what worst are pretty sexist. That said, despite being in the initial stages I don’t particularly want to disrupt a relationship even if this guy is a douche. 

*Heard from another friend a few days ago it’s getting a bit more serious between the two so not too sure whether it’s a good idea to proceed. 

Issue 3 isn’t particularly an issue like the above, we just both have exams coming up in the next few weeks and I’ve decided to give myself a cut off point of the end of this week to come to a firm decision and take action (or no action) - we both have exams coming up in a few weeks and I don’t want something like this weighing on my mind during exam season so I feel like I should come to some sort of decision fairly soon.

This may also sound quite selfish but I also want to tell her how I feel just to have some closure. I’m not trying to sound cool or laidback when I say this but I don’t particularly care if I get rejected or to be more actually I somewhat prepared for it given she’s sorta seeing someone as above as well as the other issues above not particularly weighing in my favour. I’d like some closure so that I can move on as much as I would also like to hear whether she feels the same way. I don’t want to be in a situation where I wonder what could have been. 

Ironically a female friend of mine was asked out recently and after turning the guy down she said that you should never feel bad about telling someone how you feel. That’s been weighing on my mind a lot but I am quite torn down the middle regarding this. I’ve asked a number of friends and they’re pretty adamant I should go for it (however this might just be because they’re being supportive) but I feel like some brutal objectivity from people on the net would help. 

So life gurus should I die on my sword and tell her how I feel or die on my sword and just move on.",2019-07-02 21:15:30,1,2,dating_advice

882,c8eggb,Tufaychyer,Going to see this girl in 3 weeks and I don't know how to stand,"So i met this girl from work the other day. She (**23F**) came to town for only two days to help us review and set up the activities we do at my workplace. 

We hit pretty well, I (**24M**) made her laugh and I think we had great chemistry, to be honest it was a blast for me and she seemed to have a good time too. Sometimes we exchanged some glances but since it was a workplace environment and her being there for two days (and its true I'm kinda shy), we didn't had time to do anything more. At some point half-joking she said we can go for an ice cream when i go to her town in 3 weeks to get some work related formation. So I was there thinking everything was going fine and i could see her in 3 weeks and we could have more awesome time together. 

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is that i added her on social media (I didn't want to loose track of her and 3 weeks without talking to her seemed too long). So a day later after me adding her I asked her how the trip back went. She saw my message but didn't reply until midnight that day which made me feel sad, everything seemed to be going so fine. When I received her message i was happy so i messaged her back. But she just saw my message the day after and just nothing, she didn't reply ...

&amp;#x200B;

So i sitting here wondering what i did wrong: 

\- Did I do something wrong adding her on social media, since we are working together ? 

\- Did i show too much interest and scared her ? 

\- Is she playing the hard to get ? or does she needs some space ? 

\- Did I just imagine what i wanted ? (that she was into me and I made up signals that she was interested)

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is that in 3 weeks i really wanted to get some ice cream with her (and if i were lucky, for once, maybe a little more \^\^). But with this no ""reply business"" i don't know how to stand and I really don't want to disrespect or bother her if she is not interested in me.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm asking advice here. What should i do next just wait 3 weeks or message her ? 

And in 3 weeks when i go to her town how should i behave ? (knowing i only see her for 3 days so my time there is short and I really wanted to make this right).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway thanks for your advise kind stranger. Thank you for having made it this far and for your attention. 

And sorry for my bad English. Enjoy your day and may you find happiness for we all deserve it.",2019-07-02 20:18:03,5,2,dating_advice
883,c8ebux,androidtoy16,Confusing signs from co-worker. help!,"I (M31) moved to a different floor in my office this January, and saw this really pretty woman (F39) sitting 4 aisles away from my cube.

The first few looks were casual, but I noticed that she was looking at me for a second or two longer than usual. I found her cute, and I started looking at her more. She didn't seem to mind, and we were pretty much into a staring contest for the past few months.

We don't work in the same team, so we never talked apart from the casual ""Hi"" when we cross each other's paths. The staring continued and we both caught each other several times. 

She really wasn't trying to hide it, and I decided to make the first move. I approached her one day, and asked her out. 

Her response was weird. She said she never realized I was interested in her and she never noticed me staring at her. She also said that she has seen me just a few times and that's about it. 

I knew she was denying all the staring and thought that this was a rejection and I decided to leave it and move on. 

Next couple of days, we both avoided eye contact as much as possible and I was cool about it. We still maintained our ""Hi""s whenever we crossed each other's paths, but that's about it.

But, for the whole last week, she started staring at me again, and this time with more intent. I go to the break room (I have to cross her cube) and she comes right behind me a few seconds later. This happened a few times, but we remained silent in the break room and went about our business. 

I caught her staring so many times last week that I almost forgot about the 'sort-of-rejection' that happened the week before.

I'm confused. Does she like me? Or she just likes the attention and doesn't want to go any further? I'm not sure if I made her nervous when I spoke to her which could have caused her to react the way she did.

885,c82ljk,dpqwe,I’m so tired of dating.,"29F btw

“Don’t worry, you’ll go on plenty of dates and you’ll forget all about me.”

That’s what my ex told me over two years ago as I was packing up what was my stuff out of our apartment that we had lived together in for the last year and a half. I was never good enough for him and we decided to split ways after years of borderline emotional abuse and bending over backwards to make him happy. 

I feel like he doomed me with those words honestly. Since the break up, I’ve gone on an estimate of 20-25 dates and had multiple “pseudo relationships” that I’ve bailed out of when I’ve seen the red flags waving.  Last night I just walked out of the guy who I’ve been seeing for the last month’s apartment when he started getting comfortable with me and his true colors were showing. I’m so exhausted not feeling like I’m enough, balancing between being closed off and being too emotionally open to people, and tired of sleeping with people and then being just disappointed when I find out they’re not who they portray themselves to be. 

I’m a beautiful woman, active, have an awesome career, love to travel, love the outdoors, play video games, love sports, independent, intelligent, etc etc. I feel like I’m very easy person to like and I really like myself but damn dating is depressing and takes a toll on your self esteem. I just don’t know why I can’t find anyone. 

And I’ve heard it all: “work on yourself!!” I have worked on myself and I love myself, I want to build a life with someone else. “Learn to be alone!!!” I absolutely love being alone, that’s not the problem. “It’ll happen when you least expect it!!” I’m almost thirty, I don’t think it’ll just land in my lap at this point in my life. I’m renewing my lease next month on my apartment and I honestly didn’t think I’d still be living here on my own at this point. 

Do I just redownload all my dating apps and continue trying? Do I just adopt more dogs and accept being alone? Are there better dating apps for meeting people who have their life together?? I feel like I barely get matches anymore compared to dating when I was single 5ish years ago.",2019-07-02 00:48:11,91,70,dating_advice
886,c8e99v,Jeremyzez,Moment of tormenting awkward silence,"So a girl (22F) and I (22M) went on our second date yesterday. It went very well but what happened and what is the worst thing I can think of is having to face a moment of awkward silence. So what happened was that when I was driving her home we were both kinda tired (had been hell of a week for both) and at some point we had a relatively long moment of silence. I mean, I'm not exactly sure for how long but it sure as hell felt like an eternity and for me it was unbearable.

I tend to overanalyze and exaggerate stuff but I cant help but think that I've ruined every single chance of this becoming something more. For some reason I just froze during the drive to home. I desperately tried to think of something to say and well, she did too but at some point we both froze (I dont know if that's cute but I felt awkward as fk, lol). Well we eventually started talking about something (probably something like woah check out those houses just something pretty lame) but then I already arrived at her place. 

Well she tells me she's sorry if she'd been lame company because she'd been tired (referring to the drive home obviously, because everything went perfect before I drove her home). At the end we kiss, well, make out, and she gets out of the car. 

We have texted each other afterwards. She's going on a vacation with her family for a few weeks so I wont be seeing her until when she comes home.

I feel like I've messed up any chances of this becoming something more.. all because of that silence we had. I mean yeah it was our second date so then again might not be a big deal but it still felt unbearable.

What do you think? Is this normal and could it be I'm just exaggerating things?

tl;dr: Went on a 2nd date. Went smoothly except for an awkward silence while driving her home at the end of the date. Made out with her at the end. Afterwards I felt like I've messed things up because of the silence we had.",2019-07-02 20:01:39,5,2,dating_advice

Started messaging more in May see that we get along great and have similar interests,By end of may start of June we were messaging everyday and he asked me out on a date or said if i couldn't find someone to look after my children that he would bring dinner up as he would like to meet me(I live 35 min away). I found a babysitter and we went out 5 days later. Hit it of easily like old friends dinner was great then we went back to my place and chatted all night before he gave ma a kiss and left. He continued to be his easy going self and we messaged back and forward and saw each other a few more times he was always lovely, we had endless conversations and hung out and watched netflix etc.(Did not sleep with him yet) Fast froward to the end of June my kids were away so I asked what he was Upto weekend wise, we decided I would head out to his place. On the saturday he asked if i wanted to go out for dinner and a movie or head upto a set of lakes near where we both live. i thought sweet drove to his place and we headed up to the lakes (1.5hr drive) its a beautiful place id never been and when we started talking I had mentioned that(id notice now and then he would always remember things id said or people id mentioned because he actually listens). We sat by the lake and hes very affectionate and lovely and we talk and joke round i push him in a bit he picks me up and tries to throw me in but doesn't so just all that kind of crap really and we have a great time. he talks about going back in future etc. we drive back to his place and grab takeaways on the way. He says his father will be at his place when we get back as there is sports on(no problem for me ive never met him though) we watch the game and his father is friendly and leaves after the game, hes the same person while his father is there still the nice guy, its not overly warm so he offers me a blanket and things like that. his father leave we watch a movie and cuddle on the couch, my feet are cold so he puts his giant slippers on my feet (theyre dogs) haha, eventually that night i did sleep with him and he also told me that night that he doesnt want a 1 night stand, it wasnt bad, it wasnt amazing, i really like him at this point so i was nervous haha, we watched tv afterwards he seemed perfectly normal still, i stayed the night, next morning is fine hes a bit quiet but makes me coffee and we chat etc he has work at 9 so i grab my stuff we both leave and he kisses me goodbye its still all normal. Monday hes normal, tuesday hes normal, wednesday hes a bit distant, thursday i get a rubbish message that reads

Afternoon Ive been doing a bit of thinking about me and you and Ive come to the conclusion that its not going to work with us, I thought I could handle a relationship with someone but i cant and thats pretty much it.nothing more nothing less so theres no point asking why. you have done nothing wrong I just cant handle the jandle.

Now ive never mentioned a relationship, he was the kissy cuddly affectionate one and I was just happy to spend time with him(i reciprocated of course) And he knew i liked him. I do believe his behavior was not an act as it seems like a lot of effort just to sleep wit someone who would have been a sure thing the first night you went out for dinner (hehe) whats anyone elses take on it? a good actor? an honest man? scared of commitment? maybe he just decided he doesnt like me? He has been hurt in the past this i do know. I just feel like if he was just looking to bang he really could have strung me along for quite some time. At this point I havent heard from him in 5 days and I dont plan on contacting him but im pretty bloody disappointed as we had so much fun and I could tell the connection was there for him too.",2019-07-02 22:50:11,6,1,dating_advice

890,c8bgb0,Scotty_dog88,How long should I wait?,"Hi Reddit, I’m new here so hello!! 

Soo story goes: I M31 have been separated and in the process of divorce for over a year. I met up with an old friend from school let’s call her Susan F31 (not her real name) for drinks back in feb. It was awesome but I was a mess.. all nervous and socially messed up. I had massive social anxiety as I didn’t maintain any friendships during my marriage. Lived in a bubble I suppose. Anyway we have been meeting up every couple of weeks over the last few months and we talk about absolutely everything. From dating to what went wrong in both our previous relationships. Susan is also mid divorce from a bad marriage. 

Anyway, over this period of time I have come to really like her to the point I’m thinking about her pretty much all the time. Guess I’m falling hard. She came over last weekend and we had our usual chats, about everything and anything over a few whiskeys and g&amp;ts.. the setting was almost perfect for me.. string lights in the garden, hot tub bubbling away in the background, soft blues playing on the sound system and the weather was incredible. As night fell and the alcohol took effect I confessed to her that I found her very attractive and super attracted to her both physically and mentally. She paused and said that she values our friendship way too much to get sexual.. 

Now I’ve been round the block a few times and I know rejection when I see it.. so I’m ok with that but she left it open ended.. as she said nows not the right time.. this took me back a little and I thought well ok fine.. 

Anyway the night Carried on, we chilled, talked listened to music until 3 am. I offered her the spare room but she left which is fine. 

Next morning I’m feeling terrible, rejected and at the same time so guilty and scared of losing her out of my life. I’m struggling to put her in a place in my head that I can continue seeing her without acting on the feelings I have. I text her and told her I can’t see her for a while, have the reasons why I felt the way I did and she said she understands and is going to be here when I have worked though what it is I’m going to do about it. 

My question is.. do I just chuck away this incredible friendship or do I carry on as if nothing happened.? And how long before I should contact her again? I’m really struggling to process this one. Thanks guys! Sorry for the length of this post.",2019-07-02 16:39:25,8,3,dating_advice

And I've mentioned his zodiac sign because I thought that he has lost his enthusiasm after I've agreed to be with him and that sounds like a typical aries crush? I don't know.*

Then I've got crazy for just a week and started arguments about how he must've changed his minds about liking me and he replied as there's no such a thing. We didn't talk anything about relationships and making it official because neither of us wanted to I guess. I just knew he liked me a lot from the beginning, at least he told me so. And during my arguments he didn't want to argue most of the time, either he had the most rational answers to persuade me or just didn't answer at that moment leaving the answer for later. And after that breakdown week I've had, I had sent a final text message that was probably overwhelming for him. So he didn't reply at all, I've waited for an answer and then I just thought; ok it's over now. Then I've continued my life and tried to get over it.

1-2 weeks later, he texted me with photos that remind a conversation we've had. Nothing about the former argument, just the photos and the one-word explanations about them. And I didn't want to reply then, but now it's been 5 days and I feel like replying but I don't know how to.

Deep down inside, I want to work things out even if it's not gonna be a relationship. But at the same time, I don't want to seem desperate, I tend to do that I guess.

He was really chill but kinda hard to read. We had decent conversation and I thought I was being my normal self until he made a comment about how I was slightly odd/weird(a “strange bird” if you will). I laughed it off but my brain kinda latched onto the comment and everything I said or did seemed to come across as weird from that moment on. 

Idk if I was actually being strange or he was just being a stick in the mud but the whole thing made me incredibly self conscious. After we left, we had kissed and he made another comment which sent my brain into a frenzy. I ended up crying a little. He was concerned and asked what was wrong but I couldn’t find the words to express how I felt. I was super embarrassed and mortified because I despise crying in front of others, especially strangers.

We had a date scheduled for last night but then I had to cancel because my grandpa who is in the hospital was not doing well and I was told to go over and see him because he is getting progressively worse and t might be the last time I see him.

So I informed her that my grandfather was sick and that I would need to cancel but I look forward to setting another date in the near future.

Now, we are instagram friends keep this in mind.

While at the hospital, I took some time to reflect in this beautiful garden room that they have at the hospital. It almost looks like a botanical garden that you’d find near a palace or something. I ended up taking a picture there and posting about how serene it was and how I finally got to have some peace.

Well she saw the photo and then incessantly called me and texted me saying that I’m a liar and that I went to botanical gardens with another woman and who the hell am I to lie to her like that? She even threatened to send her brother after me for “playing games and fucking around with her head”.

I tried to explain that the gardens were just in the hospital that my grandfather is in but she wasn’t having any of it.

I guess my stupid idea of posting a picture of the garden really backfired on me. FML. I blew my chances with this woman for sure. She won’t accept any apology or explanation cause her mind is made up. I really liked her too.

I had been waiting a while and it felt great to finally say it, however things are still complicated so I need advice on where to go from here.

Were both college kids that go to school far away, so we only see each other for about 1/3rd of the year right now. Either way, we have a great connection and when were both home we do everything together. She actively shows interest in hanging out and flirts a lot with me. I wont go into detail for want to keeping this short, but its clear to a lot of people that we’ve always had a bit of a thing for each other.

We were very close to getting together before we both went away to school, but then she started dating some guy at college. I thought that meant things will be different when I saw her again but we’ve only gotten even closer since.

Anyways, we started off the summer doing everything together. Getting food, just running errands, hanging out with other people, going to parties, all of it.

Then, a week or two ago, a mutual friend told her I really like her. Im told that she was surprised at first and then said she kind of figured that. After that she went cold for a week and we didn’t talk or hang out as much, and didn’t talk to my at parties, etc.

Then out of nowhere she gets hot again, talking, flirting and everything, and came to watch a baseball game of mine with one of her girlfriends. Either way, she was going on vacation after that, so i told her after the game.

I told her shes funny, beautiful, fun to hang out with, and I realized this summer that I really like her. She was flattered and blushing a lot and all, and she told me that shes happy I told her even though shes in a relationship right now.

I didnt ask her how she feels about me or tell her to break up with the other guy or anything. All i did was tell her Im here for her, and ask her to think about it. Then she hugged me and shes been on vacation this whole week.

Anyway now shes back, (ill see her soon at a party in the next few days) and im looking for advice on where to go from here. I still like her, even though I accept that things may not work out this summer, I believe that she is a girl worth waiting for. Of course ill still talk to other girls and see what happens, but im looking advice on what to do in the long-term now that she knows how I feel about her.

Like how do i act around her now and is it okay to compliment her every now and then, or even ask her to hang out like we always do? Im just not sure how to continue here",2019-07-02 20:48:17,4,1,dating_advice

907,c821qu,sugarcookiebunny,my husband is a Salty Gamer™️ and it’s adorable; The story of how to act out on your crushes,"Hi welcome to my TED talk on how I met my spouse

I do want to encourage people that there’s ways to meet people where you least expect them, and how relationships can literally hit you like a brick. Sometimes, you just gotta show someone you like them, and not really care about the consequences, because in the end, a good person would still be your friend.

During college, I met my husband through some... Really shitty friends, considering one of them had a crush on him and concluded he didn’t like her because he was gay. Ironically, she concluded I was a lesbian because I had a mild crush on her. Me and my husband are pretty 50/50 bi.

Anyway, one night we were just playing games together, and it was starting to get really late. Since it was a weekend and it was like 2 in the morning, I suggested for him to just stay over. Me being loopy from sleep deprivation and wanting to act on my crush, I just kinda gave him a good ol night night smooch and crashed on the floor. About two hours later, I roll over and I hear, “Hey OP? I think I really like you” and I kinda mumble in my sleep, “I like you too” and pass out. I jolt awake like a minute later to smooch him again... and that’s how I started dating my husband.

908,c8enar,ceaquent,Contacting her again after we stopped dating,"So my short story here is that I dated a woman for a good 4 months and last week she texted me to break things off citing a lack of connection.  Although completely let down, I responded by bowing out gracefully and letting her go.  Normally I would call it a day and just move on, but I really liked this particular woman and it left me feeling unexpectedly torn up over it.  I know that she liked me too and we had some pretty amazing dates, but she was a more introverted and reserved person which resulted in our chemistry being a little off as I attempted to navigate the murky waters of her affection without scaring her away. 

My suspicion is that I may have misread her because she was not outwardly communicative with her feelings or affection, therefore I can't help but feel a little conflicted over the way it ended.  I understand it could be any number of things that caused her to make that decision and that I should have some pride to not retread for someone who doesn't want me, but we shared a lot of time together and I went out of my way to be a really attentive great guy to her so I am a little surprised at the outcome. 

I have a few questions to ask the ladies here:

*Have you ever dated a guy who treated you really well and had so many positive traits but you still ended it? Why?*

*How would you react to a gentleman of a guy coming back around to ask for another shot after you ended things, and how would you suggest a man do this without appearing too desperate or causing her to lose respect for you?*

He's sweet as can be and I care about him a lot but there's something that really bothers me that he does. He started talking to a girl on Bumble a year ago and although they never met, they got quite close. They still text quite frequently from my understanding and even texted a couple days ago. He knows that their communication bothers me and will playfully joke about it (never in a mean-spirited way though) but he has made it pretty clear that he wouldn't stop talking to her no matter what--I got pretty upset about it at one point and he half-heartedly asked me ""do you want me to stop talking to her?"" but I didn't feel like I could actually say no. My point is, I feel like she is special enough that he wouldn't stop talking to her no matter how much it bothers me which really hurts my feelings. She is his age and quite successful which further makes me feel intimidated, which doesn't help, but I know that is neither here nor there and that is my own personal problem. I think my real issue with it, which I explained to him, is that they obviously found each other attractive enough at one point to swipe for each other. Also, he didn't tell me about her until about 2 months into our relationship, which I found strange and is why I initially got so upset. 

&amp;#x200B;

In your opinion, am I wrong to even be bothered by this at all? Am I making something out of nothing? I just feel like I would like some extra opinions on the matter :)",2019-07-02 16:29:20,6,2,dating_advice

The weird part is that she lives face to face with my house and she goes right at the school thats face to face with mine
The weirder part is that me(14) and her older brother(21 or something) know each other really well(like we talk a lot about footbal abd other things but only when we meet,and that is kinda rare sometimes like once 2 weeks)

I think the best way to aproach her would be through her brother but I don't know if i should tell him about my crush on his sister + they are hella rich cuz they own the Ford selling center in our city

915,c87ijb,SteamboatBilly15,I (21 M) need help explaining interactions with a friend of a friend (20 F),"Hey, I’m not sure where else I’d post this but here goes. Basically, this friend of a friend (let’s call her Mary) came to a graduation party we were hosting at my apartment. I hadn’t seen her since the last time she came to visit my roommate a few years ago, which was also the first time we met. Back then I had a crush on her, but right after that we both got into long-term relationships. She shows up to our party and starts acting weird around me the whole time. I’ll go in-depth about the specific moments, but keep in mind my gf is at the party and her bf isn’t, as he’s from where she lives (different country). She started our conversation by asking me about my musical interests and so we chatted about music and stuff like that. I noticed she started fiddling with her hair and maintaining strong, prolonged eye contact while we’re talking.  She’s also standing pretty close, closer than I’d expect in a conversation between two taken people. When we broke off, she often stared at me as I was talking to friends, even while she was mingling with other people. When I’d meet her gaze, she’d continue to stare and smile until I broke eye contact. A little later I hear from my gf that Mary has been talking to her about how nice I was to her a few years back showing her around town, which was no doubt influenced by how I had a crush on her. Mary would also do things like jab me to help me out when I wasn’t paying attention during a drinking game and laugh at all of my jokes. When it came time to walk to the club, it was raining, and I got wet along with everybody else. She turned to me and said “you’re so wet” and brushed off the rain from my chest and arms (my gf was in the bathroom when that happened). Later on in the night when I was dancing with my gf and being affectionate with her, Mary kind of stopped acting the way she did earlier that night. The next morning when she said goodbye to my roommates and I (she spent the night), I was the only one she hugged besides her friend that she was visiting. Am I crazy or was she flirting with me the whole time? Not like it matters because I won’t see her again and I’m happily in a committed relationship, but that insecure guy who had a crush on Mary a few years ago wants to know, for a sense of closure. I hope that makes sense?

TL;DR
Friend of a friend who has a boyfriend was being weird with me at party (touching me, prolonged staring, complimentary of me), all while my gf was there. Was she being flirty or am I reading into things too deeply?",2019-07-02 10:16:30,18,7,dating_advice

917,c8e522,schwiftytiktok,She Says he's just a friend........,"So my girlfriend of 7 months has a male friend, she claims there is nothing there. He is very short and unattractive, crazy, and does drugs. He lives several states away from us, but came down to visit once (i wasn't allowed to meet him). She is friends to get money from him and exploits him.  I hadn't figured out this all to about a 2 months ago, at that time she told me he just sent her money to help her out with her surgery even though i had taken care of it. I didn't figure out she was using him for money till recently. She also told me he understands they are just friends too. She was talking about sending him pictures once a while ago but she said they were innocent pictures normal stuff and just talks to him and keeps him from being addicted to drugs. She wants to keep this friendship up so he doesn't know about me she says he will go back to drugs or do something bad to himself. So she doesn't want me to post pictures of us together on Facebook.

I was not happy about this... but i was like hey whatever free money. Then one of my friends saw him looking at a picture of her in a dress that was intentionally unbuttoned down to her stomach so her whole chest and bra were showing in our bed that we share. We fought about it and said it was an old picture from before me, i hadn't told her i saw the picture from my friend taking a picture of his phone, but i gave up arguing because it got fairly ugly. She says he's nothing and they are just friends and would never be with him since he's so ugly.  Then i heard her say she loves him on the phone outside our house when hanging up, which she says to all he other family and close friends but she never said on the phone before when around me.

She treats me really well and we are together almost all the time when i'm not working. I feel like she loves me, but i'm just feeling betrayed and hurt by this other guy. She seemed much better before she got hurt and had to get surgery and is at home all day for 2 months.  What should i do with this relationship?

Edit: I've met a bunch of her other friends and family, it's just this guy",2019-07-02 19:52:15,11,0,dating_advice
918,c87ves,Whatisausernameforme,It feel like everyone I try to date is already interested in someone else.,"Lately all the dates i have been on I felt like the girl is already interested in someone else or they have someone else on there mind even though that person is already in a realtionship.

It doesnt matter where I get to know the girl in a bar or on an app. 

It makes me feel a bit insecure because i start to wonder if there is still a girl who isnt this way.

Dating isnt fun for me anymore and i feel like there is no reason anymore to go on another date because i am starting to think everyone already has someone who they are interested in. The last 6 dates i felt like i was a therapist nothing else. 

If feel like the person they try to date but after that i have to point out that they are interested in that other person they don't notice their behaviour themselfs( like they try to impress and constantly wait for a response from that person or make that other person jealous with pictures. Or they nonstop talk about him/her in ways you only talk about someone you are interested in).
And sadly enough i have been right about this everytime it did happen. They all did admit it and will go after the other person. 

So is there anyhope or do i need to keep on being their therapist till one shows up who isn't this way?

She kinda asked me for a date. A date it was to be. Then a month of me being really busy and her over thinking her decision. I tried staying in touch as much as I could. I had a feeling she is having 2nd thoughts when we used to talk. After my thing, a month later, we went out and when it got over she insisted we split the bill. That was when i 1st thought she didn't want it so I wud not pursue her in that way and try to stay friends. But still when we where leaving I brought up our conversation, where we decided to date, so that we could talk about it eventually. As expected, she said that the beer made her light headed she was not in the processing state then. Next day texts me and asks me what i think of this, she meant the situation where we left off i suppose. I told her i still wanted to date her and also would like to know what's in her head for little bit of clarity. She said she's afraid it might affect our friendship and wanted to know my views. I told her i was willing to take the ""risk"" and its not just because i knw her well but its ""something more i feel about it"". upon being asked for her views she says she'll need to think about it because she's very confused and doesn't want to hurt my feelings later.

921,c8dxiy,ftkrage,Please help advice needed on my situation.,"Ok this may be a bit of a read but I'm a little stuck.

so 6 years ago me and my ex broke up....the reason was none other than we were young and wanted different things, I was an absolute mess at the time and i wanted to hurl myself in front of a bus.
We had been together for 3 years. During the time apart Ive been with someone for 5 years....had a child but we recently broke up. 
Over the years I knew my ex was seeing other people but I didn't have any contact with her so the feelings were suppressed by that plus me also having a girlfriend to concentrate on.
Recently I thought I saw my ex near where I work so I messaged her on Facebook to ask. We talked a little bit over a day or 2 and I now have intense feelings come up. My stomach is knotted and ive broken down crying once aswell at the thought of her being with someone.
She has been with this person for the past 4 years so I guess there probably a bit of jealousy mixed in.
She was my first love and we were really compatible when we dated and I know I did love her, and she loved me, the way she would look at me just said it all really, I could tell she wanted no other in the world. almost asked her to marry me but chickened out over the fear that she might say no. 
So my question is, should I just cut off contact? 
Should I take it slow and try to remain friends despite feeling this strongly and her having a bf.

Should I see if she has any feelings towards me?

She seems really happy and I don't want to screw anything up with her life but I know that we were right for each other and I will regret it for the rest of my life if I were to leave it be.

923,c8aknv,vivalasviggo,Am I being taken advantage here or should I trust my gut?,"So I (21F) have been going out with John*(25M) for about a month and a half now. We're not exclusive or Bf/Gf or anything yet. To be completely honest, we clicked right when we first met and have this deep connection I've never felt with another guy. He's hilarious and has my type of humour, is a real family man, and has his career and life together which has been a problem with exes in the past. He seems like the total package. Until this past week.
 We had a date scheduled for a weekday evening, which he then cancelled at 9pm because he got stuck at work. I thought alright, not nice that he didn't shoot me a quick text when he initially realized he wouldn't make it, but everyone gets a free pass. 
We rescheduled for Saturday to get together after I'm off work. Ten minutes after I'm off, he sends a text saying that his sister had an emergency and he has to spend the day with her (he's mentioned before that his sister has dealt with sever mental health issues so I have a feeling it has something to do with that).
So now I'm thinking well this is sucky but I don't want to be rude because what if he's telling the truth and then I'm an asshole for doubting a family emergency. He reschedules for us to hang during the day yesterday. Yesterday comes and goes, and no word from him.
This morning, he sent me a long apology text saying yesterday was a gong show and that it's a shitty excuse and flaky of him and he understands if I don't want to see him this week, but that he'd love to make it up to me sometime this week if I'd like. 
Am I being ghosted?? The thing that has me still confused is that prior to every one of these dates, he is the one who initiated all these makeup dates, and then would text me about how much he's looking forward to hanging and seeing me, and mentioning how much he likes me. Should I call him out? Tell him to get lost? Or call him out and then say if this flakiness isn't going to be a regular thing, then come pick me up at 7pm on friday. I don't think he has other girls on the side because he mentioned that I am the first date he's had this year. So is it that he's out of practice? Or doesn't value other people's time as much as his? I really don't know, and I still really like him (sorry).

The problem is that I have never had a girlfriend, and I have no idea how to handle chatting with her, cause I can't find anything interesting to say and the conversation ends real quick. Then it gets awkwardly silent and I just say i gotta go back to work. The other problem is that we don't have much time to talk, only for like 15 min when i happen to go on a smoke break at the same time as her, and i definitely don't want to wait for her after work like a creep, especially that we basically don't  know each other and only talked to her like twice.  
However tho, She was the only person so far that approached me first, and she initiated the conversation the first time. This was surprising to me cause she doesn't seem like a very social person as she speaks very quietly and doesn't really interact with others at work, which gave me a little spark of hope ngl, but I'm probably imagining things like the virgin i am.

939,c86zug,GomezTE,How do I present myself on dates this far in?,"Hey!
So m(19)e and my GF(18) has been in a relationship for a bit over 1.5 years.

We regularly go on dates, but it's usually very casual and small dates. It's mostly just dinner dates, either alone or double dates with friends, movie nights, game nights, the list goes on.

As a birtday gift I gave her a weekend vacation to another city, with food, movies, boat trips etc. But along with that she got small ""gift cards"" for dates or things I could do for her. Like movie nights at the theatre, massages, more... Intimate massages... And a lot more.

She's been really stressed out lately, so I told her that we could go on a picnic, using a gift card.

We've never been on a picnic before, and she has been stressed out. Along with that we're also planning to open up a nice bottle of pink gold flake wine bottle (Aviva, look it up, pretty cool) that I got as a graduation gift.

So I kind of want to dress upp. But I don't know how far to go, to not make it overboard.

It's not going to be that hot, so I'm thinking of going with a pair of black slim fit pants, and either a pink or a wine red button up shirt. But then, that could seem a little bit overboard, so something like black shorts and a pink polo?
(those are my favourite colours leave me alone)

Is it less important to care for how you look on dates no matter the circumstances, or is it okay, or even expected to dress up a bit on these kind of occasions?",2019-07-02 09:08:50,8,5,dating_advice

On one occasion I brought her and her aunt some beers and then she gave me her fridge ? (Weird I know )

I got her number and i said “if you keep flirting with me , ima have to bag (get) you

She said “I’m not flirting that’s just how I am ☺️”

I eventually asked her to rate me and she said you’re a 10 but not my type

Then I said “don’t call me babe” after she called me that and I said “I’m big daddy”

Recently I [21F] rekindled with my ex [23M], and there were some said mutual feelings / interest expressed after a few weeks of rekindling. He wrote me this thing, saying how he doesn’t want to rush into anything and we have to get to know each other again as we are changed people from the time we broke up, which was nearly a year ago. He knows he broke my heart once and doesn’t want to do it again, and that he’s focused on different things ie. career wise and lifestyle etc. Said he obviously missed the things we used to do together but for this moment we have to get to know each other again. I accepted and understand what he wrote, and went with it. 
We currently are just sleeping with each other at this moment cause our major down time/free time clash, as he works during the week and long days, whereas I go to uni during the week and work over the weekend nights. (if that makes sense).
With him saying before that we have to get to know each other again, but how can I as he doesn’t seem to give me any opportunities to simply hang out without any or ending with sexual interactions. 
We were meant to do dinner a few weeks back, but it had to be rain checked on his end due to forgetting that some family were going away - it hasn’t been rescheduled yet and he has now said that it just has to wait as work is really busy for him at this moment. Like I can understand the reasonings. 

Honestly not sure if any of that made much sense, my mind is everywhere right now. 

I sometimes tend to over think situations and somehow create problems when there isn’t any, but right now my gut feels like I’m being played and strung along until someone better comes along, or when he’s ready to kick me to the curb again. That now the interest is purely one sided and I’m in for a heart break again soon. He denies he is playing me, and that he isn’t seeing anyone else (but obviously who would be that honest and tell someone). So what are the signs I’m being played? And how can I turn off all these worries so I can sleep 😞 or am I just over thinking this whole situation and just let it be? Or something else?

We have a pretty cool group of 3 guys and her, doing all kinds of stuff and going on adventures. She had two long term relationships in the past that didn't end well, so she is really careful now. I know she is not interested in the other two, so one day I asked her out. She said she was surprised, and that we could go on a date the next day. Next day came and she said she is not feeling it and it wouldn't be fair to me to lead me on. I said okay, no problem. That was roughly a month ago.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, we have been spending even more time together (sometimes just the two of us), texting much more than before, making plans for the summer (12 day trip coming up, me, her and two friends), she asking me about other girls, past relationships, meeting my family etc. This could mean she is just friendly (she is the friendly touching type). She met my mom, and my mom being her usual self, said something along the lines of ""you two look great together"", and her answer was ""but we are just friends""

Thing is, I like her even more now. She is one of the few people I can talk with endlessly about anything, we have many similar interests, similar ideas about the future, basically I could see us being together.

&amp;#x200B;

Just to throw something in the mix, this other girl started texting me, asking me to take her somewhere, things like that, so me being lonely I said screw it, let's try it, and we went on a full day trip. It was a really boring date, we had nothing to talk about, she isn't interested in anything, had no experiences to share whatsoever, it was really strange, until I discovered she is 19 and spends most of her life on instagram. I thanked her for the date and let it be for a while. Then she started texting me again (I think she has a crush on me). I don't think she is the right person for me, we are in different stages of our lives at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, talking to this other girl and being on a date with her I realized I was thinking about the first girl all the time, which probably means the crush is not something out of desperation. My fear is that she is not interested at all, and if I asked her on a date a second time it could damage our friendship.

949,c8bqxe,Lovelif3,Commitment problems- when to define the relationship?,"Hello, 

I am a 24 y/o f that has been seeing a 22 y/o male for about 6 months now. 

We get along great, spend a couple of nights each week with each other, and text everyday. When I started seeing him, he had just gotten out of a long term relationship with a girl he had been together with for a few years all throughout high school. When we first started talking I made it clear to him I was looking for more than a hookup, and we continued seeing each other. 



Fast forward a couple of months  in the winter and I had to ask him where he thought this was going because it was eating away at me. He indicated he wasn't ready for a relationship yet, but he wanted to continue to see me and take things slow. In my dating past, I've usually been very clingy and tended to scare guys away by being so attached right away, so this time I was aiming to relax and let things happen naturally, so I agreed. 



About a month ago, one night I had gotten very drunk and sent him a bunch of text messages and I believe he freaked out. He still hadn't replied to me the next day so I asked him if he was mad at me and that's when he told me he needed space. He essentially told me he's been looking for a way to break it off because as beautiul and  great as I am, he knew that I was more into him than he was and he just wasn't in the right head space to give me everything that I deserved. He told me he thought it wouldn't be fair to me to continue seeing me as it would only make the pain worse down the line. I was completely devastated and asked him if we could still remain friends as I cared about him. I also asked to see him in person and talk about everything as this was done over text and I didn't feel that was fair to me. He agreed to that and we met up and he basically told me the same thing, that although he enjoyed the time we spent together he didn't think his feelings were genuine. I was pretty upset but tried to be positve. I told him I could give him space if he wanted. 



We didn't talk for a couple of days, and then he texted me asking how it was going. Well ever since then, we have begun talking like normal again and everything went right back to how it was before... we still talk everyday, we see each other a couple times a week, and he's begun inviting me to things like going to his friend's cabin and parties with his friends. I sleep over a lot, he tells me how much he appreciates me, how he misses me when we're not together etc. Just this past weekend, we went to a party together and I could overhear people referring to me as his girlfriend. I didn't hear him correct them or stop them when they said this. 



NOW I'm more confused than ever! Some of my friends are telling me I should just leave it how it is and let things happen organically, and that maybe it'll be like one of those relationships where you just naturally begin to call someone your s/o. Internally, however, it is really bothering me because I feel awkward not knowing what to tell people when they ask me if I'm his girl or not. I am so afraid of asking him about where his head is at again because I am afraid of losing him. When he told me he needed space a couple months ago, I was devastated and I don't know if my heart could handle that again. I almost would prefer still being able to see him even though he hasn't made it official yet, because I'm afraid if I ask him again he'll cut me off completely. Despite this, I don't want this to go on for years of us being in this gray area... I can't tell if he's just afraid of getting his heart hurt again (his ex was the one to initiate the breakup) or if he's really just being lazy and knows I'll be around without having to put the effort in to make it official...  I need help. 



TL; DR: Should I ask him if he'll be asking me to be his girlfriend anytime soon, or do I just continue to wait it out and see how things go?",2019-07-02 17:02:53,4,1,dating_advice

So first of all I need to tell that we already know each other for about 4 or 5 years and I am a very shy guy. We got in contact because her then bf was a buddy to me (never really good friend, more platonic) but I knew fast that I have more in common and talk to her better then with him. At this time I had a gf too, so nothing special here. Fast forward my gf and I broke up 2 years ago. Last year the other 2 guys broke up too (long relationship, from school to 28).

Then on new years eve we did go out with a group of friends. She was there too and I think she is very communicative, so no problem for her to talk with others. But instead she stays close to me and we had some fun talking and dancing. Later she was very drunk and it was very exhausting. I took her home safely and called a cab for me.

As I thought it could be to early for her and maybe she only wants to have fun I took some distance.

About one month later she had a surgery and needed some help at home. So I cooked something for her and we both had a fun time. After that we started to do sports regularly. At some point we also started to get dinner after that (mostly we ordered something to her or my place) and sometimes watch tv-series together. Always friendly and not like dating or flirting. As I told you that we know each other some time it was really ok for me. 

Then we went on a fair with a friendly couple of her and again had some fun. I think it was then when I noticed that I like her more than a friend and I started to become more confident about her und myself. I even started flirting with her. So last Saturday we met with a another couple for a sport session. After that she suggested to go swimming (just the two of us). So I lay beside her and we laughed and talked really good. She was frightened about my cold hand as we touched randomly and I told her to warm me up. So she kept my hand between hers for about 5 or so minutes. On the walk back I thought to grab her hand but I didnt know where my self-confidence was. Later we sat on her couch and had a really good conversation again so I put my hand on her knee/thigh and left it there for some minutes. She did not say anything about it. Shy as I am I could not get closer to her. 

Two days later we did sports again and ate something afterwards. I tried to flirt again but this time without touching her and nothing really happened. So I have to admit that as far as I get her signals she was never really flirty or touchy like me (She likes to punch me on the arm xD). But she allowed it and I dont know whether she is shy too or just friendly.  She laughs at my jokes and we also have a lot of eye contact. So I dont know how to continue. We have a great time together but it is not normal for me to do such things with a „friend“. So I think if I do not get any further I need to step back and reduce it to sport. But that is my exit plan and I dont want to take it. Please help me to get an entry plan ;)

I recently started watching a lot of Mike’s vlogs on my own. I decided to DM him on Instagram on Saturday. I didn’t think he’d see it, yet respond. I wasn’t expecting anything. I basically told him that his vlogs gave me some clarity about why my ex was the way he was. I thanked him and told him to keep up with the good content.

Yesterday, he replied thanking me for the support then asked if I wanted to hang out. Of course I said yes. He’s super cute and I liked how raw and true to himself he was in the vlogs.

The date went very well. It was about 5 hours. We had drinks at a bar, got tacos, then went to his place. A fan actually asked for a picture with him. It was so weird. I couldn’t believe I was on a date with this guy.

Anyway, we’re at his place playing chess and talking. We end up hooking up. Right after, I get up to get dressed and go. He asks me not to leave. So we cuddled and talk for a while. I think he wanted me to sleep over, but I had work this morning. Then he says we should go star gazing on July 4th. 

He didn’t contact me today (the day after the date). In one of his vlogs, I know he mentioned that he didn’t contact a girl until a couple days later to go out again. Him being a YouTuber aside, do guys usually want the girl to stay after sex? Did he actually mean he wants to go star gazing or was he just saying that? I mean, he already got what he wanted at that point.

We've been talking for a month and a half now. We go to school together and our school friend group overlaps so I see him and hang out with him very frequently in a group setting. 

He has a couple red flags and I don't know how to address them with him. I don't know if I'm being too forward or if I'm being led on.

Red flags:
1. Only compliments me on my appearance or a generic compliment. ""You're so hot."" ""You're funny."" ""You're smart."" Nothing that ranges beyond those.

2. Our conversations are dry. ""How are you?"" ""What're you doing?"" He does not seem to be interested in getting to know me. 

3. His last relationship ended when he was 21, so he hasn't been in a relationship for nearly 8 years.

4. Sex comes up in conversation when it has no purpose being in the conversation. We haven't slept together yet but he brings sex up frequently. I've told him to stop and he has but I'm still afraid of what his intentions are with me.

5. Has not asked me out on a date. Every time we hang out it's at our apartments and we just stay in and make out or watch Netflix.

I've even asked him where this was heading towards, either fwb or relationship and he told me he sees himself in a relationship with me. His words are not congruent with his actions. 

We are also spending the summer apart because we're on summer break. I'm confused. I don't know how to date and I don't know if this confusion is warranted. I don't know how to address it to him.",2019-07-02 09:42:07,9,3,dating_advice
965,c8akrw,LostAsFuck98,The lack of intimacy is killing me NSFW. Sorry for the length,"My boyfriend(21) and I (f21), have been together for over a year and a half. Before we started officially dating, we were just FWB who snuck around and did al the things a couple do without being official (I had a big fear of commitment). The intimate part of it included sex quite often, frequent and random makeout sessions, and so much cuddling I had never realized how wonderful it could be to have someone care for you. He was my first, so he kind of set what I thought was normal in terms of frequency of sex and intimacy. 

Then everything started changing after we officially started dating. It was a slow change at first, more romantic things(which I don’t mind at all) and less sexual things (still enough to keep me satisfied). As time progressed the amount of intimacy kept steadily declining. Of course, me being the self conscious loser I am, I assumed it was my fault and he was no longer attracted to me. He assured me that wasn’t it at all and said he was just really tired from work and school. I tried to accept it and deal with it. The intimacy got even less, with sex being about once every two weeks with little to no foreplay for me and a quick finish for him. He blamed it on low T and said he didn’t feel comfortable talking to his doctor about it because he’s had the same doctor for most of his life and didn’t feel comfortable talking to her about his sex life. That was understandable, so I tried to just deal with it. Since then I’ve learned that you can buy testosterone boosters and supplements without having to talk to your doctor about it. I tried asking him why he didn’t go that route and he just kind of blew up at me. 
I am hypersexual. I was told by my therapist that it was my mind and body’s way of coping with years of sexual abuse when I was younger, so my frequent masturbation and need for sexual gratification has been a long time thing. At the beginning of the relationship, he was totally fine with this, as he was a horny college student and a girl who was down to do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted it was probably great. But with the gradual lack of sex from him, I was back to masturbating frequently and kind of being shamed by him for always being horny. I once asked him if I could buy a sex toy, because I felt like his input on something like that is important. He said no and was immediately pissed. I tried talking to him about it and basically got, “I don’t need to be reminded that I can’t take care of your needs. Idk how you thought that wouldn’t make me feel like shit.” So of course I felt shitty while trying to figure out how he refuse to do anything to fix his problem and still be mad at me for trying to deal with mine. 
Lately, sex normally only happens when he initiates it, and when it’s him wanting it, it’s completely different. He’s passionate and aggressive and it’s great. We makeout and he kisses and bites my neck, and does all the small things that turn me on(still minimal foreplay for me because he clearly has one goal in mind). Afterwards, we either cuddle and things are kind of like they used to be, or he gets dressed and says he has to head home. When I try to initiate it, I get told “nope” and he pokes my nose, talking to me like I’m a child. Or he’ll be fine with it as long as I’m on top. No foreplay for me, he can’t just let me do my thing while on top(he starts thrusting wildly until he finishes), and normally gets dressed immediately after, making me feel like a one night stand. I’ve tried to talk to him about it, but the conversation normally leads to him getting mad and making me feel like shit. I really don’t know what to do. I love him so much but this has completely killed my self esteem",2019-07-02 15:27:13,6,1,dating_advice
